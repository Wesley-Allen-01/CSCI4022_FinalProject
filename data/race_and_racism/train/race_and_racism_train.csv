Since those fleeting days when he was a unifying figure , Giuliani has more often dealt in waspish rhetoric and savage mockery -- especially of a president he says has `` failed . ''
`` America 's Mayor '' has gone rogue , lashing out at Democrats and liberal orthodoxy on the war on terror and saying , for example , during the Ferguson controversy last year that the biggest danger to a black child was not from a white police officer but from another African American .
The latest firestorm over Obama 's patriotism may complete Giuliani 's political journey from the center left of the Republican Party to the conservative jungles where Sarah Palin and Donald Trump roam .
`` Rudy has devolved into this red meat Republican base ideologue who periodically seems to need self identification , '' said Douglas Muzzio , a political scientist at Baruch College and a New York City media commentator . `` Maybe it is Rudy in his dotage , where he has lost whatever boundaries he once had . He sounds like a bitter old man . ''
Giuliani seems to be relishing his moment back in the spotlight .
But he 's also causing awkward moments for Republican candidates limbering up for a crack at the presidency in 2016 -- a fact the White House was quick to exploit on Friday .
`` It 's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature , and even admiration , tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly , '' said Obama 's spokesman , Josh Earnest . `` And the truth is , I do n't take any joy , or vindication , or satisfaction from that . I think , really , the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today . ''
Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz also joined in , seeking to use Giuliani to frustrate the GOP 's effort to short circuit controversies which could tarnish the party 's image .
`` Now is the time for its leaders to stop this kind of nonsense . Enough , '' she said .
Giuliani 's blast , delivered in a closed door Republican dinner , and repeated in a media tour , centers on a claim that Obama was not brought up to `` love '' his country like most Americans .
It 's a familiar charge from the conservative fringe , that Obama is somehow different and does n't view America as an exceptional paragon but is obsessed with apologizing for its failings .
`` I do not believe , and I know this is a horrible thing to say , but I do not believe the president loves America , '' Giuliani was quoted as saying by Politico .
Asked by Fox News host Megyn Kelly Thursday whether he wanted to apologize , Giuliani replied : `` Not at all . I want to repeat it . ''
`` I do n't feel this love of America , '' Giuliani said . `` I believe his initial approach is to criticize the United States . ''
Giuliani dug in further in an interview with the New York Times , rejecting the idea that his remarks were born of racism .
`` I thought that was a joke , since ( Obama ) was brought up by a white mother , a white grandfather , went to white schools , `` said Giuliani . `` This is n't racism . This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism , '' said Giuliani .
Far from being chastened , Giuliani , who wore a conspiratorial grin on Fox News , seems gleeful in the firestorm . His behavior might be explained by a boxing maxim he was taught as a boy , which may also shed light on his calmness on 9/11 .
`` My father taught me ... when you get hit in the face for the first time , you 're going to panic , '' Giuliani said in an interview with Forbes magazine in 2011 . `` Instead of panicking , just accept it . Stay calm . And any time anybody hits you , they always leave themselves open to be hit . ''
Giuliani 's actions may be both a glimpse at his political philosophy and reflect a decision to wade into the political echo chamber to solidify his standing among a certain group of conservatives .
`` He understands political posturing , he understands the effectiveness of rhetoric , '' said Errol Louis , a CNN political commentator from New York . `` He clearly wants to play a role on the national stage . I guess he has chosen the role of bulldog -- go after the president , attack him , make wild accusations . ''
With a failed presidential campaign behind him , and having been out of office for a decade-and-a-half , it may be that Giuliani sees his future on the conservative talk circuit .
`` To the extent that Giuliani will be involved in the game moving forward , it will be as a commentator or an analyst , '' said Costas Panagopoulos , a campaigns expert at Fordham University , New York . `` In order to do that successfully these days , it helps to be controversial , sometimes inflammatory . I am not surprised that he has become increasingly forceful in his comments in the media . He is convinced that will help him . ''
Giuliani has rarely been known to back down . He was a Yankee fan growing up in Brooklyn , a ruthless prosecutor who took on unions and the Mob and a hard driving Republican who ran a liberal city .

Giuliani during his “ America ’ s mayor ” phase , right after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks — when he wowed the world with his civic leadership , soaring oratory and unifying largess — the former New York mayor ’ s racially charged comments about President Obama might seem puzzling .
But Mr. Giuliani ’ s road to and through City Hall was punctuated with racial controversy .
From his 1993 campaign challenging David N. Dinkins , the city ’ s first African-American mayor , during which Mr. Giuliani stood with rowdy protesting police officers — some of whom carried signs suggesting that voters should “ Dump the washroom attendant ! ” because Mr. Dinkins had proposed a commission to look into police misconduct — to his writing off a black New Yorker killed by the police as “ no altar boy ” ( though he actually was ) , Mr. Giuliani has had a complicated relationship with African-Americans .
Of course , Mr. Giuliani ’ s brusqueness was in no way limited to black New Yorkers . He targeted and disparaged , in no particular order , street vendors , ferret owners , artists who made paintings that offended him , Democrats at every level of government and pretty much anyone who made even minor policy critiques .
“ He preferred to use a cannon on a mosquito , ” said Bill Cunningham , who ran the first mayoral campaign of Michael R. Bloomberg , who succeeded Mr. Giuliani . “ It was not enough to disparage a position or statement . There was some innate need to personalize attacks in order to curry favor with a target group . ”
In many ways , Mr. Giuliani ’ s political career was formed in a tinder box of race . His first campaign against Mr. Dinkins in 1989 was defined by the sense of history many black New Yorkers sought to fulfill by electing Mr. Dinkins , but also by a decade of racial tension in New York . Roger Ailes , the chairman and chief executive of Fox News who was Mr. Giuliani ’ s main media adviser in that first campaign , suggested that if his client didn ’ t win the second time around , “ this city is going to turn into Detroit . ”
Mr. Giuliani felt burned and hurt by his lack of support among minority voters in his first run for mayor , and worked hard to improve relations with black New Yorkers for his second run . By 1993 , the city was besieged by racial tensions between Korean immigrants and blacks , and blacks and Jews , and there was an increasing perception that Mr. Dinkins had lost control . Mr. Giuliani narrowly beat Mr. Dinkins , though he did not make significant gains in support among black voters .
Mr. Giuliani was lauded most in his two terms in office for the reduction in crime , but the improvement was tempered by poor relations between the city ’ s Police Department and minorities . Most notable was the 2000 killing of the unarmed black man , Patrick Dorismond , outside a city bar , after which Mr. Giuliani made the unusual step of releasing Mr. Dorismond ’ s sealed juvenile police record and saying that Mr. Dorismond was “ no altar boy. ” ( Mr. Dorismond had been an altar boy , in fact , and had even attended the same Catholic school as the mayor . )
After his failed run at the White House in 2008 , Mr. Giuliani stayed largely out of the cauldron of racial discord , as the city became increasingly diverse and far less segregated by neighborhood . But he did wade back into the issue when two police officers were killed in New York late last year after a spate of protests over the police shootings of unarmed blacks across the country . Mr. Giuliani said that most blacks died at the hands of other blacks , noting , “ The people who do the most for the black community in America are the police . ”
His comments about Mr. Obama this week at a fund-raising event for Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin could be a matter of Mr. Giuliani seeking to energize conservatives preparing for a Republican primary contest , in which disparaging Mr. Obama is expected . Or it could be Mr. Giuliani speaking from the heart . Either way , his comments were not new .","Photo

Other Confederate symbols have come down around the South as calls to get rid of rebel monuments intensified during protests over Floyd’s death, in which an Minneapolis police officer was charged with murder.

The city of Birmingham removed a towering obelisk after another statue was toppled by protesters. Virginia’s governor has decided to remove a huge statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia, after city authorities said they’ll remove other Confederate monuments from Monument Avenue.

Semmes was a Confederate commerce raider, sinking Union-allied ships during the Civil War. According to the Encyclopedia of Alabama, he was jailed on treason charges in New York City before returning South after the war, and was later prohibited by U.S. authorities from taking office as an elected judge in Mobile.

He devoted his later years to writing his memoirs and became a “Lost Cause” hero to Southerners who lamented the end of the Confederacy.

MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new , tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case , delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice .
The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin , who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd ’ s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder . The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter .
All four were fired last week . If convicted , they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison .
Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . Those charges still stand .
The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd ’ s death without intent while committing another felony , namely third-degree assault . It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison , compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder .
The other officers — Thomas Lane , J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting . All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening . Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held .
The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty .
The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison , who called the protests unleashed by the death “ dramatic and necessary ” and said Floyd “ should be here and he is not . ”
“ His life had value , and we will seek justice , ” said Ellison , who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions .
Hundreds of protesters were in New York City ’ s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced .
“ It ’ s not enough , ” protester Jonathan Roldan said , insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start . “ Right now , we ’ re still marching because it ’ s not enough that they got arrested . There needs to be systematic change . ”
Ben Crump , an attorney for Floyd ’ s family , called it “ a bittersweet moment ” and “ a significant step forward on the road to justice. ” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd ’ s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted .
The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history , in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence , including deadly attacks on officers , rampant thefts and arson in some places .
Nationwide , more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest . At least 12 deaths have been reported , though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out .
Minnesota Gov . Tim Walz , speaking after the new charges were announced , said the state and nation need to “ seize the moment ” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism , including unequal educational and economic opportunities .
“ I think this is probably our last shot , as a state and as a nation , to fix this systemic issue , ” he said at a news conference .
Also Wednesday , the Hennepin County Medical Examiner ’ s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd , which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19 , but was apparently asymptomatic . The report was released with the family ’ s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers .
President Donald Trump has pushed the nation ’ s governors to take a hard line against the violence . He again tweeted Wednesday : “ LAW & ORDER ! ”
An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team , the Secret Service , the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Bureau of Prisons and , according to a senior defense official , at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation ’ s capital . Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building .
Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House , and an array of agencies kept watch from the air . An FBI plane , an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead .
At one point near the White House , protesters began singing “ Amazing Grace ” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear . “ We are not going anywhere ! ” they chanted . There were no signs of confrontations .
Protester Jade Jones , 30 , said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges .
“ That ’ s the least they could do , ” said Jones , who had been attending Washington protests for days . “ It ’ s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain . ”
“ We are glad there are additional charges , but that doesn ’ t mean justice has been served , ” she said .
More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence .
In New York City , where high-end stores were looted in earlier days , some retailers fortified their property . At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue , windows were boarded up , then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire . The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs . There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night , but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police .
In Greece , police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens . Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration , when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police . No injuries or arrests were reported .

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice.

The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison.

Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand.

The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder.

The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held.

The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty.

The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.”

“His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions.

Hundreds of protesters were in New York City’s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced.

“It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.”

Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice.” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted.

The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places.

Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to “seize the moment” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities.

“I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,” he said at a news conference.

Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers.

President Donald Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!”

An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation’s capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building.

Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead.

At one point near the White House, protesters began singing “Amazing Grace” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. “We are not going anywhere!” they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations.

Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges.

“That’s the least they could do,” said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. “It’s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain.”

“We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn’t mean justice has been served,” she said.

More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence.

In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police.

The protests have also taken root overseas.

In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities.

The anger over Floyd’s death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S.

In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s.

In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests.

The 36-second video is difficult to watch. Taken from inside a vehicle, it shows the unarmed, 25-year-old Mr. Arbery jogging on a residential road when he comes upon a white truck stopped in the street. One white man is standing in the bed of the pickup and another beside its open driver’s-side door. Both are armed, one with a shotgun. Mr. Arbery runs around the truck and disappears from view before he reemerges. There is muffled shouting and three shots sound as Mr. Arbery tussles with the man with the shotgun before he stumbles and falls on the road. There is blood on his shirt.

The two men are father and son. The father, Gregory McMichael, is a former police officer and retired investigator in the local district attorney’s office who told police he and his son chased Mr. Arbery because he resembled a suspect in a rash of recent break-ins. The video appears to contradict portions of that account, and the handling of the case doesn’t inspire confidence.

The arrest of the father and son came after the outcry caused by the release of the video and the intervention of state officials. “All I want to do is get justice for my son,” said Marcus Arbery, the slain man’s father. “This is terrible. It could happen to anybody’s kid.” We would add: especially, and tragically, if they are black.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Speaking on Thursday , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that because of the unrest in Charlotte , quote , “ the country looks bad to the world. ” He again used the events to appeal to black voters .
DONALD TRUMP : The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant . It ’ s their jobs , housing markets , schools , economic conditions that will suffer . And the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety . We have to do that . There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct . Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration . Never , ever . Our job—thank you—our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor , but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace , to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations .
Well , for more , we ’ re joined by the Reverend Dr. William Barber , president of the North Carolina NAACP and Moral Monday leader .
And I wanted to ask you , the impact—Trump , in his remarks , never mentions the violence being perpetrated on African Americans by some of these police officers . I ’ m wondering your sense of the impact of his words , because he ’ s sounding more and more like a reversion back to Richard Nixon and “ law and order ” as his campaign theme for the presidency . His impact on the African-American community , especially on African-American youth , of Trump ’ s words ?
REV . WILLIAM BARBER : Well , you just hit the nail on the head . It ’ s a hypocrisy , and it ’ s revisionist history , and he ’ s reaching back to the strategy that Kevin Phillips gave to Richard Nixon on how to hold onto the South and win the country . It ’ s called the Southern strategy : use all kind of code words and misdirection . But it ’ s full of hypocrisy , and it ’ s full of untruthful things .
First of all , Donald Trump is running to be-divider-in-chief , suppressor-in-chief , hater-in-chief and reverser-in-chief . No matter what he says in his cute teleprompter speech , we have to remember what he said with his mouth , and , more importantly , his policies . Now , let ’ s listen to what his policies are . First , he is for voter suppression . When the Supreme Court said that North Carolina had engaged in surgical racism against black people in voting laws , he came to North Carolina and said that that decision would open up fraud . He joined with those who perpetrated racism and surgical voter suppression . Number two , Donald Trump is for reversing Medicaid expansion , which would hurt 20 million Americans—many , many , many white Americans , but 3 million African Americans alone . He is—he believes that we have—number three , he believes we have too high of a minimum wage and is not for living wages . There are 64 million Americans—black , white and brown—who make less than the living wage , and 54 percent are African-American . He is not for raising the living wage . He ’ s for the proliferation of guns , the very cause of much of the violence in our community . He is for tax cuts on the wealthy and raising tax and fees on the poor and the working poor in ways that would take us back to the kind of recession policies that we saw under George Bush and the false notions of trickle-down . He is for the kind of policies that could possibly proliferate war , which will be negative to poor whites and blacks who end up fighting the wars often that rich people engage in . He is for taking money from public schools , which black , brown and poor white people need , and giving it to private schools that can segregate and that most black , brown and white people can not go to . And so , over and over again , what he says on his teleprompter and what his policies actually show us are two different realities .
And he ’ s not talking to black people . If you listen to him or some of his campaign people , this is the narrative . And it ’ s a shrewd and sinister narrative out of the Southern strategy . “ Black people will not let us help them , ” he ’ s saying , “ will not trust us , ” the very people who since 1968 and the Southern strategy have been against everything that benefited the progression of black people . Number two , “ Black people are their own problem . They are their own problem. ” And number three , “ Black people are the cause of your problems , ” saying that to white people , “ particularly in all of the money we ’ ve had to spend on welfare , ” which , in fact , most of the welfare is actually used by black people—white people—Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid and social safety net . It is a hypocritical argument , and it is a dangerous argument and is a sinister argument , because it is not a serious conversation about race and racial disparity .
AMY GOODMAN : Reverend Barber , I wanted to play for you the comment of Republican Congressmember Robert Pittenger , whose district includes parts of Charlotte , who said demonstrators were upset because , unlike North Carolina ’ s white residents , the African Americans are not successful . He made these comments on BBC .
JAMES O ’ BRIEN : With respect , Congressman , I don ’ t think the people on the streets last night and the night before were protesting against Lyndon B. Johnson ’ s almost half-a-century-old policies . What is their grievance , in their mind ?
REP. ROBERT PITTENGER : Well , no , the grievance in their mind is that they—the animus , the anger . They hate white people because white people are successful and they ’ re not . I mean , yes , it is . It is a welfare state . We have—we have spent trillions of dollars on welfare . But we ’ ve put people in bondage so that they can ’ t be all that they ’ re capable of being .
AMY GOODMAN : Hours later , Congressman Pittenger apologized in several posts on Twitter , saying his anguish about what was happening in Charlotte prompted him to respond to a question , quote , “ in a way that I regret. ” But I ’ m wondering if you could respond to this . And also , talk about North Carolina , your state . I mean , right now , people are voting for president , is that right ? Or people are engaged in early voting . But first respond to Congressman Pittenger .
REV . WILLIAM BARBER : Well , he had to say he regretted , and what he really probably regrets is the first part of what he said . See , in this white Southern strategy , you ’ re not supposed to say , “ They hate us because we ’ re successful. ” You ’ re not supposed to be that overt in your racism . You ’ re simply supposed to say “ welfare state ” as a code word for racism . You ’ re supposed to say “ tax cuts ” or “ entitlement programs , ” that we need to get rid of , as code words . He blew the code , and he was out in the open .
Because what he said—racism , as you know , is not rooted in fact ; it ’ s rooted in fear . It ’ s not rooted in truthfulness ; it ’ s rooted in foolishness . His history is wrong . We know that the Great Society programs , many of them work , especially for white people . Many of the programs now that he and others demean are the very programs that helped lift many whites , particularly in the South and in other areas , out of poverty .
We know , when you look at that particular congressperson and look at his record , if we—if the country follows his voting record , we would have less voting rights , because he has refused to sign on to restoring the Voting Rights Act . We ’ d have less healthcare , less wages . We would have less love and less mercy .
And many of the very people that are hurt by the policies he promote are white . We have 1.9 million poor people in North Carolina . The majority of them are white . Three hundred and forty-six thousand of the 500,000 people being denied Medicaid expansion are white . What he and others are afraid of is what we ’ ve seen in the Moral Monday movement and what I ’ m seeing as I ’ m going around the country in “ The Revival : Time for a Moral Revolution ” : black and white and Latino people coming together and forming fusion coalitions and understanding that all of this divisive rhetoric and these divisive policies and this white Southern strategy was designed to keep the very people apart from each other that need to be allies , who need to change this country . You know , lastly , Amy , if you look at the stats on Politico , PolitiFact , the majority of the states that—counties—are the poorest are those that have states that are so-called—led by so-called red states or people who claim to be Republican . The very policies that they promote hurt the people that they sell this false narrative .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Reverend Barber , we ’ ve been talking about the situation in Charlotte , but I ’ d like to also bring in what ’ s happened in Tulsa , where police officer Betty Shelby has been booked at the local county jail and released on $ 50,000 bond . On Thursday , Shelby was charged with felony manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher . The criminal complaint says Shelby ’ s , quote , “ fear resulted in her unreasonable actions which led her to shooting. ” She is accused of , quote , “ unlawfully and unnecessarily ” shooting Crutcher after he did not comply with her “ lawful orders. ” If convicted , Shelby faces four years to life in prison . Could you talk about the difference between what happened in the situation in Tulsa versus what ’ s happened so far in Charlotte , and what you would hope to happen in Charlotte ?
REV . WILLIAM BARBER : Well , first of all , you did not have the context like you ’ ve had in North Carolina in the kind of regressive , violent policy attacks that we ’ ve seen over the last three years by this governor . So there ’ s already a lot of unrest , hurt and pain in North Carolina . You know , we even have been a state that has launched the worst attack on the LGBTQ community , the living wage , people fighting for living wage , and even persons who wanted employment discrimination in the state courts . You also have in North Carolina a state that ’ s had the highest number of African Americans exonerated from death row in the last 10 years of any state in the country . You also have a state where we have innumerous people who are incarcerated—African Americans—for crimes they did not commit , and the governor has refused to pardon them . In fact , I have a press conference about two of them this morning . You also have a place where the crime lab was found to—abused over 200 cases , and people have—in terms of the way they dealt with DNA evidence . You also have a city where you had Jonathan Ferrell , and , even though someone was indicted , it ended up with a hung jury , and people said a hung jury was a spoken jury , when we know that ’ s not true . A hung jury is a hung jury .
So , you have to understand all of that , the context of all of that , all of the attacks on the poor , all of the attacks on healthcare and voting rights . And then you drop this situation in . And unlike Tulsa , where they had transparency , and they now have an indictment , we ’ ve actually had—we ’ ve not had transparency , and we ’ ve found out more and more evidence that points against the police narrative—which also proves something , too , that black people , as you said , are not just against cops or against white cops , because in this situation the chief is black and the alleged shooter is black . Black people are saying , whatever it is , we want transparency . And it ’ s not just black people ; it ’ s black and white people saying it together . We want transparency . And that is the number one problem here in Charlotte . There was not transparency . And the police overreacted , did not listen to the community leaders that were on the ground , and exacerbated a problem that did not have to go this way .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you explain the governor of North Carolina , your state , the stance he has taken right now , where you see things going , his relationship with the governor—with the mayor of Charlotte ? She did impose a curfew but said they wouldn ’ t enforce it if people were peaceful . And the people were peaceful .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain who gives the governor his power , and the movement that you ’ ve been leading , the Moral Mondays movement , and the effect you think it ’ s had .
REV . WILLIAM BARBER : Well , you know , supposedly , the people give the governor the power . But let ’ s look at the governor ’ s rhetoric , because my deep suspicion is there is some pushing around all of this to try to create some political movement , because , you know , he ’ s in trouble . So , my understanding from the clergy is that there wasn ’ t even a great desire by the City Council and other persons to create the emergency—state of emergency in the first place . Remember , we ’ re in a state—and God knows we are against any form of violence . Those officers that were hurt the first night , the young man that was killed , and we don ’ t know how he was killed—we do know that we have a lot of conflicting accounts of that . But , Amy , we understand the governor pushed for this emergency piece . Now , we ’ re in a state where we—for instance , UNC wins the championship , and we ’ ve seen cars overturned , bonfires started in the middle of the street , and we don ’ t have an emergency state . In fact , they open up the burn unit . So , how do you move from 99.9 percent of the protesters doing the right thing , a few dozen doing the wrong thing , and suddenly there ’ s an emergency state in a city that ’ s already prepared to handle even a presidential convention ? That ’ s number one .
Number two , this curfew , we don ’ t know where it came from and what pressures were put on to have the curfew , and we saw that it was totally unnecessary . And the police and the community leaders could have handled legitimate discontent and anger and nonviolent justice protest .
Lastly , this governor has been a source of division throughout the country and here in North Carolina . And he actually has lied . And I don ’ t normally say that like that . But I heard him the other night say on CNN—he claimed his love for Dr. King , which all people—which they tend to run to every time people express legitimate discontent . Well , remember , Dr. King was called a militant . He said that he respected nonviolent protesters . Well , we protested for 21 weeks , were arrested , and he never met with us . He has refused to meet with clergy . As late as two weeks ago , clergy of all different faiths attempted to just deliver a moral declaration of values to his office , and they would not receive it . So , this governor is saying one thing for a political reason , but the political reality is something very different . He , like Donald Trump , has been a divider . He has helped to stir more division . He has dishonored the nonviolent tradition and now does not really have the credibility to challenge what ’ s going on , even in terms of the violence , because he has passed policies that has cost people their lives .

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Speaking on Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that because of the unrest in Charlotte, quote, “the country looks bad to the world.” He again used the events to appeal to black voters.

DONALD TRUMP: The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing markets, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety. We have to do that. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. Never, ever. Our job—thank you—our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Well, for more, we’re joined by the Reverend Dr. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP and Moral Monday leader.

And I wanted to ask you, the impact—Trump, in his remarks, never mentions the violence being perpetrated on African Americans by some of these police officers. I’m wondering your sense of the impact of his words, because he’s sounding more and more like a reversion back to Richard Nixon and “law and order” as his campaign theme for the presidency. His impact on the African-American community, especially on African-American youth, of Trump’s words?

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Well, you just hit the nail on the head. It’s a hypocrisy, and it’s revisionist history, and he’s reaching back to the strategy that Kevin Phillips gave to Richard Nixon on how to hold onto the South and win the country. It’s called the Southern strategy: use all kind of code words and misdirection. But it’s full of hypocrisy, and it’s full of untruthful things.

First of all, Donald Trump is running to be-divider-in-chief, suppressor-in-chief, hater-in-chief and reverser-in-chief. No matter what he says in his cute teleprompter speech, we have to remember what he said with his mouth, and, more importantly, his policies. Now, let’s listen to what his policies are. First, he is for voter suppression. When the Supreme Court said that North Carolina had engaged in surgical racism against black people in voting laws, he came to North Carolina and said that that decision would open up fraud. He joined with those who perpetrated racism and surgical voter suppression. Number two, Donald Trump is for reversing Medicaid expansion, which would hurt 20 million Americans—many, many, many white Americans, but 3 million African Americans alone. He is—he believes that we have—number three, he believes we have too high of a minimum wage and is not for living wages. There are 64 million Americans—black, white and brown—who make less than the living wage, and 54 percent are African-American. He is not for raising the living wage. He’s for the proliferation of guns, the very cause of much of the violence in our community. He is for tax cuts on the wealthy and raising tax and fees on the poor and the working poor in ways that would take us back to the kind of recession policies that we saw under George Bush and the false notions of trickle-down. He is for the kind of policies that could possibly proliferate war, which will be negative to poor whites and blacks who end up fighting the wars often that rich people engage in. He is for taking money from public schools, which black, brown and poor white people need, and giving it to private schools that can segregate and that most black, brown and white people cannot go to. And so, over and over again, what he says on his teleprompter and what his policies actually show us are two different realities.

And he’s not talking to black people. If you listen to him or some of his campaign people, this is the narrative. And it’s a shrewd and sinister narrative out of the Southern strategy. “Black people will not let us help them,” he’s saying, “will not trust us,” the very people who since 1968 and the Southern strategy have been against everything that benefited the progression of black people. Number two, “Black people are their own problem. They are their own problem.” And number three, “Black people are the cause of your problems,” saying that to white people, “particularly in all of the money we’ve had to spend on welfare,” which, in fact, most of the welfare is actually used by black people—white people—Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and social safety net. It is a hypocritical argument, and it is a dangerous argument and is a sinister argument, because it is not a serious conversation about race and racial disparity.

AMY GOODMAN: Reverend Barber, I wanted to play for you the comment of Republican Congressmember Robert Pittenger, whose district includes parts of Charlotte, who said demonstrators were upset because, unlike North Carolina’s white residents, the African Americans are not successful. He made these comments on BBC.

JAMES O’BRIEN: With respect, Congressman, I don’t think the people on the streets last night and the night before were protesting against Lyndon B. Johnson’s almost half-a-century-old policies. What is their grievance, in their mind?

REP. ROBERT PITTENGER: Well, no, the grievance in their mind is that they—the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not. I mean, yes, it is. It is a welfare state. We have—we have spent trillions of dollars on welfare. But we’ve put people in bondage so that they can’t be all that they’re capable of being.

AMY GOODMAN: Hours later, Congressman Pittenger apologized in several posts on Twitter, saying his anguish about what was happening in Charlotte prompted him to respond to a question, quote, “in a way that I regret.” But I’m wondering if you could respond to this. And also, talk about North Carolina, your state. I mean, right now, people are voting for president, is that right? Or people are engaged in early voting. But first respond to Congressman Pittenger.

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Well, he had to say he regretted, and what he really probably regrets is the first part of what he said. See, in this white Southern strategy, you’re not supposed to say, “They hate us because we’re successful.” You’re not supposed to be that overt in your racism. You’re simply supposed to say “welfare state” as a code word for racism. You’re supposed to say “tax cuts” or “entitlement programs,” that we need to get rid of, as code words. He blew the code, and he was out in the open.

Because what he said—racism, as you know, is not rooted in fact; it’s rooted in fear. It’s not rooted in truthfulness; it’s rooted in foolishness. His history is wrong. We know that the Great Society programs, many of them work, especially for white people. Many of the programs now that he and others demean are the very programs that helped lift many whites, particularly in the South and in other areas, out of poverty.

We know, when you look at that particular congressperson and look at his record, if we—if the country follows his voting record, we would have less voting rights, because he has refused to sign on to restoring the Voting Rights Act. We’d have less healthcare, less wages. We would have less love and less mercy.

And many of the very people that are hurt by the policies he promote are white. We have 1.9 million poor people in North Carolina. The majority of them are white. Three hundred and forty-six thousand of the 500,000 people being denied Medicaid expansion are white. What he and others are afraid of is what we’ve seen in the Moral Monday movement and what I’m seeing as I’m going around the country in “The Revival: Time for a Moral Revolution”: black and white and Latino people coming together and forming fusion coalitions and understanding that all of this divisive rhetoric and these divisive policies and this white Southern strategy was designed to keep the very people apart from each other that need to be allies, who need to change this country. You know, lastly, Amy, if you look at the stats on Politico, PolitiFact, the majority of the states that—counties—are the poorest are those that have states that are so-called—led by so-called red states or people who claim to be Republican. The very policies that they promote hurt the people that they sell this false narrative.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Reverend Barber, we’ve been talking about the situation in Charlotte, but I’d like to also bring in what’s happened in Tulsa, where police officer Betty Shelby has been booked at the local county jail and released on $50,000 bond. On Thursday, Shelby was charged with felony manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher. The criminal complaint says Shelby’s, quote, “fear resulted in her unreasonable actions which led her to shooting.” She is accused of, quote, “unlawfully and unnecessarily” shooting Crutcher after he did not comply with her “lawful orders.” If convicted, Shelby faces four years to life in prison. Could you talk about the difference between what happened in the situation in Tulsa versus what’s happened so far in Charlotte, and what you would hope to happen in Charlotte?

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Well, first of all, you did not have the context like you’ve had in North Carolina in the kind of regressive, violent policy attacks that we’ve seen over the last three years by this governor. So there’s already a lot of unrest, hurt and pain in North Carolina. You know, we even have been a state that has launched the worst attack on the LGBTQ community, the living wage, people fighting for living wage, and even persons who wanted employment discrimination in the state courts. You also have in North Carolina a state that’s had the highest number of African Americans exonerated from death row in the last 10 years of any state in the country. You also have a state where we have innumerous people who are incarcerated—African Americans—for crimes they did not commit, and the governor has refused to pardon them. In fact, I have a press conference about two of them this morning. You also have a place where the crime lab was found to—abused over 200 cases, and people have—in terms of the way they dealt with DNA evidence. You also have a city where you had Jonathan Ferrell, and, even though someone was indicted, it ended up with a hung jury, and people said a hung jury was a spoken jury, when we know that’s not true. A hung jury is a hung jury.

So, you have to understand all of that, the context of all of that, all of the attacks on the poor, all of the attacks on healthcare and voting rights. And then you drop this situation in. And unlike Tulsa, where they had transparency, and they now have an indictment, we’ve actually had—we’ve not had transparency, and we’ve found out more and more evidence that points against the police narrative—which also proves something, too, that black people, as you said, are not just against cops or against white cops, because in this situation the chief is black and the alleged shooter is black. Black people are saying, whatever it is, we want transparency. And it’s not just black people; it’s black and white people saying it together. We want transparency. And that is the number one problem here in Charlotte. There was not transparency. And the police overreacted, did not listen to the community leaders that were on the ground, and exacerbated a problem that did not have to go this way.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you explain the governor of North Carolina, your state, the stance he has taken right now, where you see things going, his relationship with the governor—with the mayor of Charlotte? She did impose a curfew but said they wouldn’t enforce it if people were peaceful. And the people were peaceful.

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: Explain who gives the governor his power, and the movement that you’ve been leading, the Moral Mondays movement, and the effect you think it’s had.

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Well, you know, supposedly, the people give the governor the power. But let’s look at the governor’s rhetoric, because my deep suspicion is there is some pushing around all of this to try to create some political movement, because, you know, he’s in trouble. So, my understanding from the clergy is that there wasn’t even a great desire by the City Council and other persons to create the emergency—state of emergency in the first place. Remember, we’re in a state—and God knows we are against any form of violence. Those officers that were hurt the first night, the young man that was killed, and we don’t know how he was killed—we do know that we have a lot of conflicting accounts of that. But, Amy, we understand the governor pushed for this emergency piece. Now, we’re in a state where we—for instance, UNC wins the championship, and we’ve seen cars overturned, bonfires started in the middle of the street, and we don’t have an emergency state. In fact, they open up the burn unit. So, how do you move from 99.9 percent of the protesters doing the right thing, a few dozen doing the wrong thing, and suddenly there’s an emergency state in a city that’s already prepared to handle even a presidential convention? That’s number one.

Number two, this curfew, we don’t know where it came from and what pressures were put on to have the curfew, and we saw that it was totally unnecessary. And the police and the community leaders could have handled legitimate discontent and anger and nonviolent justice protest.

Lastly, this governor has been a source of division throughout the country and here in North Carolina. And he actually has lied. And I don’t normally say that like that. But I heard him the other night say on CNN—he claimed his love for Dr. King, which all people—which they tend to run to every time people express legitimate discontent. Well, remember, Dr. King was called a militant. He said that he respected nonviolent protesters. Well, we protested for 21 weeks, were arrested, and he never met with us. He has refused to meet with clergy. As late as two weeks ago, clergy of all different faiths attempted to just deliver a moral declaration of values to his office, and they would not receive it. So, this governor is saying one thing for a political reason, but the political reality is something very different. He, like Donald Trump, has been a divider. He has helped to stir more division. He has dishonored the nonviolent tradition and now does not really have the credibility to challenge what’s going on, even in terms of the violence, because he has passed policies that has cost people their lives. You know, when a state denies 500,000 people Medicaid simply because they don’t like a black man in the White House, that means about a thousand to 1,500 people die every year, which means somewhere upwards of 5,000 people in North Carolina have died since this governor and Legislature has denied Medicaid expansion.

AMY GOODMAN: We want to thank you, Reverend Barber, for joining us. I also wanted to point out the lawyer for the Scott family, Justin Bamberg, is a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, also represented Alton Sterling’s family in Baton Rouge, African-American man gunned down by police, as well as another Mr. Scott, Walter Scott. People may remember in North Charleston, South Carolina, Walter Scott gunned down by a police officer after the officer stopped him for a taillight being out. We’ll—

REV. WILLIAM BARBER: Yeah, Amy, if you would, I know you’ve got to run, but please—as people said, this man was not even the suspect. And also remember, the Walter Scott case, there was a plant. There was a plant, shown on the video. We are convinced that if this video was about a citizen shooting a cop and it showed it clearly, that the video would be out. And if the video was conclusive, it would be out. Something is wrong in the reason why they will not release that video, and we need to listen to the experts and the family and have it released.

Christians the world over have been united in their revulsion over the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer, and faith leaders from across the theological spectrum have spoken out about the lessons they think Christians should draw from the incident.

Many Protestant and Roman Catholic ministers have emphasized a Christian obligation to love one's neighbor and to work for justice in the earthly world.

Michael Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, raised the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan, who stopped to give aid to a man who had been beaten and left on the side of the road.

""Only the Samaritan saw the wounded stranger and acted,"" Curry said. ""Love, as Jesus teaches, is action like this as well as attitude. It seeks the good, the well-being, and the welfare of others as well as one's self.""

In a message to his ""dear brothers and sisters in the United States,"" Pope Francis advised, ""We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life.""

For evangelical Christian leaders, however, crafting a response to Floyd's killing is complicated by their view of sin in individual, not societal, terms and their belief in the need for personal salvation above all. Evangelical theologians have long rejected the idea of a ""social gospel,"" which holds that the kingdom of God should be pursued by making life better here on earth.

In addition to joining those protests , donating to organizations that fight for racial justice or shopping at Black-owned businesses , you can put your investment dollars to work for the cause .
“ What comes after protests is money , and money is what will make change sustainable , ” says Tiffany Aliche , a financial educator and founder of The Budgetnista .
Here are six ways to support racial justice with your investment portfolio .
1 . Invest in Black-owned companies and funds that support racial justice
Kenneth Chavis , a certified financial planner at Mercer Advisors in Scottsdale , Arizona , says investing in stock of Black-owned companies can have two major advantages for investors : diversification and the potential for strong performance .
Diversification — which involves spreading your investment portfolio across companies of different industries and locations — is key to reducing risk in your portfolio , as is choosing companies of different sizes . As Chavis notes , small companies are often known for their growth potential . “ Keeping in mind that some of the Black-owned companies are smaller , there is a ton of research that shows that over long periods of time , on average , the probability that a smaller company will outperform the average large company — or just the broad market — is extremely high. ” Of course , small companies are also known to be much higher risk , so as always , you ’ ll want to vet your investment carefully .
Unfortunately , there are only a handful of these stocks listed on public exchanges , and weeding through individual stocks to build a portfolio requires research and expertise . So another option is to use your dollars to invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that will do that work for you . The Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF NACP , -0.90 % tracks the Morningstar MORN , +0.02 % Minority Empowerment Index and provides exposure to companies that meet the NAACP ’ s guidelines ( though the fund itself is not sponsored , endorsed or promoted by the NAACP ) . Plus , all net advisory profits from the fund ’ s management fee are donated to the NAACP .
Peer-to-peer lending companies like SoLo Funds give people who have historically been overlooked by financial institutions and traditional loan programs the ability to access capital . SoLo borrowers can set the terms of their loan themselves , and there is no formal approval process . Lenders earn “ appreciation tips , ” and there are no minimum requirements , so you can get started with any amount .
The benefit of peer-to-peer lending , Chavis says , is asset class diversification : P2P loans are typically not correlated to the stock market . “ It ’ s also a good way to help disadvantaged communities get access to capital , either for business reasons or personal reasons , ” he adds .
P2P lending comes with one main risk : There is always a chance the borrower may not be able to repay the loan . SoLo attempts to counteract this by providing every borrower a “ SoLo score , ” which acts as a platform-specific credit score and is based on your initial registration and how you handle your loans . To further reduce risk , Chavis strongly advises diversifying the loans you offer by lending to multiple people and allocating no more than 10 % of your overall portfolio to this practice .
You can reward public companies that donate money to support racial justice with your own investment dollars . Over the past few months , several large corporations have pledged money toward antiracism efforts . By investing in companies that are committed to putting their money where their mouth is , you are letting those companies know you support their decisions .
Remember , too , that “ spending money is investing money , ” says Aliche . “ You might not be seeing a return if you ’ re not an actual stock shareholder , but you ’ re putting money into those companies . ”
Don ’ t miss : Venture funding remains elusive for Black tech entrepreneurs
Before spending your dollars , she advises looking at a company ’ s social media , their website and reviewing who is on their team . “ Spending your money with companies that are in alignment is critically important , ” says Aliche .
You may not have angel investor status yet , but you can still invest in some cool startups that aren ’ t yet publicly traded . Republic allows investors to find emerging businesses and get in on the ground floor for as little as $ 10 . The site also lets you filter listed businesses to those with Black founders ( as well as to those with female founders and other socially responsible investing criteria ) .
You can also invest in real estate ( and in some cases , the businesses those buildings will house ) with Buy the Block , a crowdfunding platform that is all about providing people with an equity stake in their communities and working to stop gentrification . You can invest on Buy the Block for a minimum of $ 100 ( which is significantly less than most real estate crowdfunding platforms ) . Many of the projects listed on Buy the Block are in historic Black neighborhoods or benefit a local Black community ( such as markets that aim to bring produce grown by Black farmers into food deserts ) .
Investing in startups and real estate crowdfunding carries a significant amount of risk , and you may lose your entire investment . As always , do your research before making any investment .
If your current bank doesn ’ t meet your needs , consider a Black-owned bank . According to a 2019 FDIC study , minority deposit institutions originate a greater share of their mortgage loans to minorities than non-MDIs . Some are also designated Community Development Financial Institutions , which means 60 % of their financing activities are targeted to low- and moderate-income populations .
“ I really like small , local banks , ” says Aliche . “ Put your money toward banks that are reinvesting back into the community where you are , and don ’ t be afraid to ask what initiatives they have for the African-American community . Even if it ’ s not an African American-owned bank , they might have more community-focused initiatives than a larger bank . ”
Working with a Black financial adviser not only invests your money back into the community , it helps that adviser continue adding their perspective to the predominantly white space of financial advice . You can find a directory of Black financial advisers through the Association of African-American Financial Advisors .
You can also opt to invest and get financial guidance through a Black-owned investment platform . For example , Freeman Capital is a Black-owned and -founded investment platform that recognizes that the wealth gap is hurting women and people of color , and offers everything from automated investing to consultations with CFPs .","Antiracism protests have called for action and change in our police departments and other systems that have historically oppressed people of color — including the financial system.

In addition to joining those protests, donating to organizations that fight for racial justice or shopping at Black-owned businesses, you can put your investment dollars to work for the cause.

Peer-to-peer lending companies like SoLo Funds give people who have historically been overlooked by financial institutions and traditional loan programs the ability to access capital.

To further reduce risk, Chavis strongly advises diversifying the loans you offer by lending to multiple people and allocating no more than 10% of your overall portfolio to this practice.

3. Invest in companies that financially support racial justice

You can reward public companies that donate money to support racial justice with your own investment dollars. Over the past few months, several large corporations have pledged money toward antiracism efforts. By investing in companies that are committed to putting their money where their mouth is, you are letting those companies know you support their decisions.

Remember, too, that “spending money is investing money,” says Aliche. “You might not be seeing a return if you’re not an actual stock shareholder, but you’re putting money into those companies.”

If your current bank doesn’t meet your needs, consider a Black-owned bank. According to a 2019 FDIC study, minority deposit institutions originate a greater share of their mortgage loans to minorities than non-MDIs. Some are also designated Community Development Financial Institutions, which means 60% of their financing activities are targeted to low- and moderate-income populations.

“I really like small, local banks,” says Aliche. “Put your money toward banks that are reinvesting back into the community where you are, and don’t be afraid to ask what initiatives they have for the African-American community. Even if it’s not an African American-owned bank, they might have more community-focused initiatives than a larger bank.”

6. Learn from and work with Black financial professionals

Working with a Black financial adviser not only invests your money back into the community, it helps that adviser continue adding their perspective to the predominantly white space of financial advice. You can find a directory of Black financial advisers through the Association of African-American Financial Advisors.

You can also opt to invest and get financial guidance through a Black-owned investment platform. For example, Freeman Capital is a Black-owned and -founded investment platform that recognizes that the wealth gap is hurting women and people of color, and offers everything from automated investing to consultations with CFPs.

Bobby Scott of Virginia, has about three-dozen bipartisan co-sponsors in the House already. If #BlackLivesMatter protesters were chanting “Pass the SAFE Justice Act now!” they could find themselves in position to make significant change. Somehow they are blind to the opportunity.

It has been said that politicians see the light once they feel the heat. If only the energy and passion of #BlackLivesMatter protesters could be harnessed in something constructive rather than destructive.

Lobby Congress, hold voter registration drives, quiz candidates on their plan for sentencing reform, but don’t heckle the candidates and incite violence by calling for cop-killing. The movement could be critical to securing and mobilizing black support for criminal justice reform that actually would improve black lives.

I am reminded of something my father, who trained boxers, once told me.

He said even the best fighters know fear is like fire. It can cook your food and light your home. It can also burn your house down and kill you. The key to controlling fear or fire is turning it to a constructive purpose.

Now if only #BlackLivesMatter will harness its own fire into the urgent cause of criminal justice reform.",www.foxnews.com,right,YjyUN31uBHlevNCf

In an `` exclusive '' interview with People magazine this week , first lady Michelle Obama lamented the `` sting '' of `` racist experiences '' that she and her husband allegedly still suffer . My message for America 's Marie Antoinette ? Cry me a river .
To show how she 's down with The Struggle of post-Ferguson agitators , Mrs. Obama cited a supposedly horrifying incident at a Target store where she was treated , in her paranoid mind , as a subservient . `` Even as the first lady , '' she bemoaned , `` not highly disguised , the only person who came up to me in the store was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf . ''
A lowly peon asked her for an innocent favor ? It 's Jim Crow all over again ! ABC News reports that Mrs. Obama said such `` incidents are 'the regular course of life ' for African-Americans and a 'challenge ' for the country to overcome . ''
Newsflash : Oh , deep in my heart , I do believe that it is part of the `` regular course of life '' of tall people of all colors ( Mrs. Obama is 5-foot-11 ) to be prevailed upon to reach high on behalf of those of us who are vertically challenged . These are not odious `` incidents '' of racism between slaves and masters . They 're matters of common courtesy between equals .
So overcome your ridiculously hypersensitive , privileged self and deal with it , girl ! ( And now do n't get all hot and bothered about the `` girl '' thing . Sheesh . )
There is , of course , a truly insidious `` -ism '' at work here : Cynicism . Mrs. Obama 's dissemination of her false racial narrative in a popular celebrity rag is cunningly calculated to pander to America 's aggrieved leftists . We know Mrs. Obama 's victim sob story is a steaming pile of rotten turnips because the last time she talked about The Incident , it was a feel-good late-night talk show anecdote devoid of discrimination .
On David Letterman 's show in 2012 , the haute-couture-clad first lady recounted the same `` incognito '' Target visit to demonstrate her just-like-you bona fides . She chuckled as she shared how the shopper asked : `` Can you reach on that shelf and hand me the detergent ? '' As the audience laughed with delight and Mrs. Obama grinned from ear to ear , she told Letterman : `` I reached up , 'cause she was short , and I reached up , pulled it down -- she said , 'Well , you did n't have to make it look so easy . ' That was my interaction . I felt so good . ''
From overjoyed Regular Mom to Oppressed Martyr , can Mrs. Obama 's shopping fable get any more absurd ? To paraphrase a popular slogan of the social justice mob : Jig 's Up , Do n't Compute .
It just goes to show you : Once a race hustler , always a race hustler . The first lady demonstrated a willingness to employ accusations of racial oppression for political gain from the earliest days of her adult life . Take Mrs. Obama 's senior thesis at Princeton University , titled `` Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community . '' Decrying her racial otherness , the Ivy Leaguer accused her university of pushing her down the dreaded path toward `` further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society ; never becoming a full participant . ''
Yet , while regaling campaign crowds with complaints about bias , burdensome education loans and the beastly lily-white corporate world , Mrs. Obama neglected to mention that it was a white male Princeton alum who went beyond the call of duty to bring her from her imagined `` periphery '' to the center of power .
As I recounted in my book `` Culture of Corruption , '' Sidley and Austin corporate law partner Stephen Carlson offered the elite student generous career guidance and mentoring while she was an undergrad and then reached out to her again when she was at Harvard Law . She secured a coveted job as a summer associate in 1987 , accepted a full-time job upon graduation and never looked back . Mrs. Obama , perpetual victim , hopped from Princeton to Harvard to prestigious law firms , cushy nonprofit gigs , an exclusive Hyde Park manse and a crony corporate board appointment before landing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
Only in America is such upward mobility possible by a thin-skinned incessant whiner who has fabricated racial tall tales all the way to the tippy-top of the ladder of opportunity .

The fight over racial justice that has sparked protests across the country is also upending some of the country's leading newsrooms.

At The New York Times, James Bennet stepped down Sunday as editorial page editor, yielding to colleagues who had protested the posting of a column by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in which he advocated that the military help quell civil unrest.

The day before, The Philadelphia Inquirer Executive Editor Stan Wischnowski resigned. Controversy had erupted both in and outside his newsroom when the paper published the headline ""Buildings Matter, Too"" atop a column on rioting. Reporters there argued it equated property damage to human life.

And at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, rank-and-file journalists are fighting back after editors banned a black reporter from covering local protests. It was retribution for writing a flippant tweet comparing looters to country music fans after a concert.

NPR has learned that a white reporter at the paper who had tweeted a vulgar disparagement of a man accused of looting also received a warning on the same day as his black colleague. But the white reporter kept covering issues related to the protest. He was banned from covering protests two days later, only after the newspaper's union raised the issue of disparate treatment.

Post-Gazette Managing Editor Karen Kane and Executive Editor Keith Burris did not respond to detailed requests for comment.

The Post-Gazette newsroom has a tense relationship with its owners. Staffers have worked without a union contract for more than three years. Post-Gazette journalists have previously objected to the firing of liberal editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers over several cartoons, including ones satirizing President Trump. Co-owner John Block, who is the paper's publisher and is also listed as editor-in-chief, had his photo taken in 2016 with Trump aboard the candidate's private jet during the height of the campaign season. Burris was also on the plane, according to contemporaneous accounts.

Editors sideline a black reporter over a tweet

In this case, Alexis Johnson remembers coming into the newsroom one week ago full of story ideas about the protests. She is 27, African American and a Pittsburgh native.

""These are very much my friends and family and community members that were out there in the streets, protesting against police brutality in the black community,"" she told NPR.

Editors did not respond to her pitches. Instead, she says, she was called by the paper's managing editor and two other top editors. They pointed to a tweet she had sent out the previous night.

""Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who don't care about this city!!!!!"" she wrote. "".... oh wait sorry. No, these are pictures from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate. Whoops.""

The pictures showed the debris-strewn aftermath of Chesney's concert at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field.

""It's almost a running joke in Pittsburgh,"" Johnson said. ""It's infamous — what happens after these Kenny Chesney concerts when he comes into town.""

Johnson said she asked the editors to describe the bias they said she had shown.

""They kept doubling down, saying I gave my opinion through the tweet and that my opinion came through in the tweet,"" Johnson said. ""And I don't think that's the case at all. I think people made their own opinions of what I was trying to say. I thought it was kind of clever.""

The paper barred Johnson — the daughter of a state trooper and a probation officer — from covering a story in her hometown about police and racial justice. Editors subsequently sidelined a black photographer, Michael Santiago, as well. The two are among a small number of black journalists at the paper. Of the 140 members of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, 13 are African American.

Colleagues took to social media to denounce the newspaper's moves and to rally support for Johnson and Santiago. Scores retweeted Johnson's original remarks. Since then, the paper has removed links to stories about racial justice written by several reporters who have voiced support for the two, according to the union.

The controversy lays bare the tension between a pursuit of impartiality that has been a journalistic tenet for three quarters of a century and a new urgency, felt keenly among younger journalists and journalists of color, to bear witness to what they're seeing.

Two years ago, as editorial page editor, Burris wrote an editorial arguing that Trump's remarks should never be characterized as racist, even, he wrote, after describing African nations as ""shithole countries."" It sparked an outcry, including from some of Block's relatives and shareholders in the paper's parent company.

Now one of Burris' reporters, Johnson, says she believes her editors discriminated against her because of her race. And the gentler rebuke meted out to a white colleague for a related transgression appears to buttress her case.

Editors respond differently to white journalist

Like Johnson, digital sports reporter Joshua Axelrod is in his late 20s — 28 to be exact — and less than a year into his job.

A week ago, Axelrod reported on a man accused of vandalizing and looting stores in downtown Pittsburgh. He tweeted about it, calling the suspect a vulgar slang word.

""Not a very sound journalistic decision, admittedly,"" he told NPR in his first public comments on his actions and how the paper handled it.

""It felt like the nation and my city were undergoing a very tough time, and it was tough to separate myself as a journalist and just a person in the world,"" he said. ""And I recognize the mistake I made. But it came from a place of emotions running high.""

His editors reprimanded him — on the same day that Johnson received her editors' calls. Axelrod subsequently deleted the tweet.

Unlike Johnson, however, Axelrod says he did not receive a directive preventing him from covering stories involving the protests. Indeed, he says he asked whether he was being punished and was told he was not. Axelrod posted an article related to the protests the next day.

The Newspaper Guild soon weighed in, noting that Johnson had been treated more severely than Axelrod. Faced with the seeming contradiction, the paper didn't relent against Johnson. Instead, the Post-Gazette banned Axelrod from protest coverage, too.

Axelrod tells NPR he supports Johnson and Santiago.

""I made a legitimate journalistic mistake,"" Axelrod says. ""I do not think either of them did.""

In a press conference Monday, the union denounced the newspaper for what it contended was racial bias and called for advertisers to pressure the Post-Gazette to reverse its decisions.

In a series of tweets, Post-Gazette reporter Andrew Goldstein noted he had been encouraged to cover the mass killings at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 despite his own ties to the event: He is Jewish and lives near the synagogue. Further, he argued that the paper's black journalists propel its knowledge of its communities.

""Diversity brings strength to newsrooms,"" Goldstein wrote. ""I've seen it in action.""

Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) could not answer CNN anchor Jake Tapper 's question about who will protect the citizens of Minneapolis if the local police force is disbanded .
During Sunday 's `` State of the Union , '' Tapper asked Omar about her insistence that police should be defunded and an alternative law enforcement should be put into place .
Omar , who represents a portion of Minneapolis , could not tell Tapper what would happen once the police are disbanded .
Last week , the Minneapolis City Council passed a resolution to replace the local police force with a `` community safety '' model .
`` You have talked about dismantling — the need to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department , '' Tapper began . `` What takes its place , and if you could just decree what takes its place ? Who investigates crimes ? Who arrests criminals ? What happens ? ''
Omar responded with a bit of background information , rehashing the city council 's resolution .
`` So , Minneapolis unanimously just voted on a resolution that will engage the community on a one-year process of what happens as we go through the process of dismantling the department and starting anew , '' she began . `` A new way forward ca n't be put in place if we have a department that is having a crisis of credibility , if we have a department that 's led by a chief who 's suited for racism , if we have a department that has n't solved homicide . ''
She added , `` Half of the homicides in the Minneapolis Police Department go unsolved . ''
The lawmaker continued , pointing out the fallibility of the police department , rather than answering Tapper 's simple question .
`` There have been cases where they have destroyed rape kits , '' Omar insisted . `` And so you ca n't really reform a department that is rotten to the root . What you can do is rebuild . And so this is our opportunity , you know , as a city to come together , have the conversation of what public safety looks like , who enforces the most dangerous crimes that take place in our community . ''
Tapper , clearly through with Omar 's history lesson , responded , `` You 're — just to be clear , though , you 're not saying that there 's nothing that takes its place . You 're not saying that if a woman is raped ... ''

You can listen to the exchange in the video below .","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) could not answer CNN anchor Jake Tapper's question about who will protect the citizens of Minneapolis if the local police force is disbanded.

What are the details?

During Sunday's ""State of the Union,"" Tapper asked Omar about her insistence that police should be defunded and an alternative law enforcement should be put into place.

Omar, who represents a portion of Minneapolis, could not tell Tapper what would happen once the police are disbanded.

Last week, the Minneapolis City Council passed a resolution to replace the local police force with a ""community safety"" model.

""You have talked about dismantling — the need to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department,"" Tapper began. ""What takes its place, and if you could just decree what takes its place? Who investigates crimes? Who arrests criminals? What happens?""

Omar responded with a bit of background information, rehashing the city council's resolution.

""So, Minneapolis unanimously just voted on a resolution that will engage the community on a one-year process of what happens as we go through the process of dismantling the department and starting anew,"" she began. ""A new way forward can't be put in place if we have a department that is having a crisis of credibility, if we have a department that's led by a chief who's suited for racism, if we have a department that hasn't solved homicide.""

She added, ""Half of the homicides in the Minneapolis Police Department go unsolved.""

The lawmaker continued, pointing out the fallibility of the police department, rather than answering Tapper's simple question.

""There have been cases where they have destroyed rape kits,"" Omar insisted. ""And so you can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root. What you can do is rebuild. And so this is our opportunity, you know, as a city to come together, have the conversation of what public safety looks like, who enforces the most dangerous crimes that take place in our community.""

Tapper, clearly through with Omar's history lesson, responded, ""You're — just to be clear, though, you're not saying that there's nothing that takes its place. You're not saying that if a woman is raped ...""

Omar interrupted, insisting that the greater conversation is ""going wrong.""

""I think that's really where the conversation is going wrong, because no one is saying that the community is not going to be kept safe,"" she said. ""No one is saying crimes will not be investigated. No one is saying that we are not going to have proper response when community members are in danger.""

She insisted, ""We can't go about creating a different process with the same infrastructure in place.""

Not once during the interview did Omar actually answer Tapper's original question of what will take the place of traditional law enforcement, who will be responsible for investigating crimes or even arresting criminals.

CHAZ , recently renamed the Capitol Hill Organized Protest ( CHOP ) , has dubbed itself a cop-free zone and includes the police department ’ s East Precinct , which was abandoned by officers . Some officers returned to the precinct June 11 and the Seattle PD previously told ███ that as of June 12 , there were officers inside of the building .
███ had three reporters in CHAZ from June 12 – 16 and , in that time , did not see a single uniformed officer . It is unclear if the officers remained in the building after the June 12 statement . The Associated Press reported Tuesday that despite CHAZ claiming itself as a cop-free zone , the department says it is not .
“ There is no cop-free zone in the city of Seattle , ” Chief Carmen Best said Monday according to the AP . “ I think that the picture has been painted in many areas that shows the city is under siege . That is not the case . ”
The Seattle PD specifically pointed out an incident Sunday evening where a local business owner said he called 911 repeatedly and no one arrived to help . The business owner , John McDermott , was calling about a break-in and vandalism , according to the AP .
“ The officers responded to the call and they observed the location from a distance . They did not see any signs of smoke or fire or anything else and they did not see a disturbance , ” according to Best .
Daily Caller reporters were present immediately following this alleged break-in when a mob of people from inside CHAZ came for the business after a false report that a man was being held at gunpoint inside . Three reporters present did not see any cops and no cops appeared to arrive when the mob came for the business .
“ I can ’ t even get the police to show up , I can ’ t get the fire department to show up , ” one man guarding the business told reporters . ( RELATED : EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS : False Reports Inside CHAZ Cause Angry Mob To Descend On Small Business )
“ It sucks that we have to do this , ” another man there said . “ It sucks that I look at my friends and my family that are part of the police force and they worry more … I ’ m [ more ] worried about them than anything else . And they aren ’ t even allowed in these spots . ”
“ This needs to get taken over . It needs to be under control . And it is not under control . … The fact that there ’ s no cop zones , that is disturbing and it is going to ruin the state , ” the man continued , adding that it is unsettling that he can ’ t call cops to help all the peaceful protesters that were trying to deescalate the situation . Some emotional comments from another man involved in the local business . The business is apparently within the no-cop zone . “ I can ’ t even get the police to show up , I can ’ t get the fire department to show up … and this kind of mob stuff , that doesn ’ t work. ” pic.twitter.com/LD3Q8JpL6N — Shelby Talcott ( @ ShelbyTalcott ) June 15 , 2020
It is not immediately clear why Seattle PD officers “ observed the location from a distance ” if CHAZ and the surrounding area is not a cop-free zone . Numerous men guarding the business told reporters that 911 , an emergency line , was called and no cops arrived .
The police department refused to comment on its decision to respond to a 911 call by “ observing from a distance , ” and similarly refused to confirm if “ observing from a distance ” was part of standard 911 protocol .
Instead , Seattle PD sent the Caller a map of the CHAZ .
“ The Seattle Police Department will respond to significant life-safety issues in the shaded area , ” Sergeant Lauren Truscott wrote in a statement .
Authorities did not show up to the scene until the next day , and even then , it was the Seattle fire chief , not the police .

“ The City of Seattle continues to meet with demonstrators to work toward long-term solutions to issues within this area , ” Truscott continued .
“ For all other calls originating from this area , dispatchers and officers will attempt to coordinate officer contact outside of these boundaries when feasible . Officers have and will continue to document calls for service that originate within these boundaries . ”","The Seattle Police Department said that Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) is not a cop-free zone, but Daily Caller reporters on the ground heard a different story.

“The officers responded to the call and they observed the location from a distance. They did not see any signs of smoke or fire or anything else and they did not see a disturbance,” according to Best.

Daily Caller reporters were present immediately following this alleged break-in when a mob of people from inside CHAZ came for the business after a false report that a man was being held at gunpoint inside. Three reporters present did not see any cops and no cops appeared to arrive when the mob came for the business.

“I can’t even get the police to show up, I can’t get the fire department to show up,” one man guarding the business told reporters. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS: False Reports Inside CHAZ Cause Angry Mob To Descend On Small Business)

“It sucks that we have to do this,” another man there said. “It sucks that I look at my friends and my family that are part of the police force and they worry more … I’m [more] worried about them than anything else. And they aren’t even allowed in these spots.”

“This needs to get taken over. It needs to be under control. And it is not under control. … The fact that there’s no cop zones, that is disturbing and it is going to ruin the state,” the man continued, adding that it is unsettling that he can’t call cops to help all the peaceful protesters that were trying to deescalate the situation. Some emotional comments from another man involved in the local business. The business is apparently within the no-cop zone. “I can’t even get the police to show up, I can’t get the fire department to show up … and this kind of mob stuff, that doesn’t work.” pic.twitter.com/LD3Q8JpL6N — Shelby Talcott (@ShelbyTalcott) June 15, 2020

It is not immediately clear why Seattle PD officers “observed the location from a distance” if CHAZ and the surrounding area is not a cop-free zone. Numerous men guarding the business told reporters that 911, an emergency line, was called and no cops arrived.

The police department refused to comment on its decision to respond to a 911 call by “observing from a distance,” and similarly refused to confirm if “observing from a distance” was part of standard 911 protocol.

Instead, Seattle PD sent the Caller a map of the CHAZ.

“The Seattle Police Department will respond to significant life-safety issues in the shaded area,” Sergeant Lauren Truscott wrote in a statement.

Authorities did not show up to the scene until the next day, and even then, it was the Seattle fire chief, not the police.

“The City of Seattle continues to meet with demonstrators to work toward long-term solutions to issues within this area,” Truscott continued.

“For all other calls originating from this area, dispatchers and officers will attempt to coordinate officer contact outside of these boundaries when feasible. Officers have and will continue to document calls for service that originate within these boundaries.”",www.dailycaller.com,right,Fsu7oIXgix7expYG

In many countries around the world underprivileged Muslims are now facing not only a pandemic that is threatening their lives and livelihoods , but also a spike in institutionalised Islamophobia .
In India , since the emergence of COVID-19 , members of the country 's 200 million-strong Muslim community have repeatedly been accused of being `` super spreaders '' of coronavirus both by the media and the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .
In late March , after a Muslim religious gathering in New Delhi allegedly led to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in the city , a politician from the BJP dubbed the gathering `` corona terrorism '' , and called for Muslims who attend mosques amid the pandemic to be `` punished like terrorists '' . As a result , `` corona jihad '' became a trending topic on social media and many Muslims , including volunteers distributing relief material , faced physical and verbal attacks . A BJP legislator from the state of Uttar Pradesh , meanwhile , called for a boycott of Muslim vendors , accusing them of `` infecting vegetables with saliva '' .
The Indian media also contributed to the stigmatisation of Muslims during the pandemic . As politicians continued their efforts to blame the rapid spread of the virus in the country on Muslims , pro-government media organisations ran shows and published reports that support this unfounded accusation .

In April , the government made cremations compulsory for coronavirus victims , which goes against the Islamic tradition of burying the dead . The measure not only deprived Muslims of a basic religious right , but it contributed to the widespread perception that Muslim religious practices aid the spread of the virus .
Islam has at its heart the sanctity of life and honouring the dead is an extension of that sanctity . There are four duties that Muslims are obligated to perform upon the passing away of a fellow Muslim ; they are to wash the body , shroud it with clean sheets , perform the funeral prayer even if only with a few people , and provide a dignified burial .

A report by retired federal and state judges tasked by the San Francisco district attorney’s office to examine police practices in San Francisco found “racial disparities regarding S.F.P.D. stops, searches, and arrests, particularly for Black people.” The judges, working with experts from five law schools, including Stanford Law School, found that “the disparity gap in arrests was found to have been increasing in San Francisco.” (Officers in San Francisco were previously revealed to have traded racist and homophobic text messages, and those working in the prison system had reportedly staged and placed bets on inmate fights.)",www.vanityfair.com,left,GvXKWb0BMlJZW3Il

Today in the park there is no plaque , no bench and no monument , to paraphrase Toni Morrison , to memorialize the human lives brutalized there throughout much of the 19th century . After a hard-fought Civil War , the institution of chattel slavery was legally abolished as the U.S. nominally attempted to make racial violence a thing of the past . These days , in the public space situated across from the White House , one is likely to encounter instead an odd mix of office workers on lunch break and MAGA-hat-wearing tourists mingling around the hotelier ’ s former mansion , known as Decatur House .
Or at least , that was the scene before the past three weeks turned Lafayette Park into a crucible for the fight over the still-present legacy of slavery in America : systemic racism .
Just before 7 p.m. on June 1 , a deployment of local , state and federal forces , armored head to toe in riot gear , unleashed rubber bullets and sprayed tear gas onto a crowd of peaceful demonstrators gathered in the park to protest under the mantra “ Black Lives Matter. ” Moments after the crowd was forcibly dispersed , screaming as their eyes burned from the gas , President Donald Trump strolled out of the White House flanked by senior members of his Administration , triumphantly holding up a Bible so the press could snap a few photos .
Since then , the debate over systemic racism has spread across the nation and around the world . Trump ’ s Administration has repeatedly denied that discrimination against black Americans is embedded in the political , economic and social structure of the country . Trump believes there are “ injustices in society , ” his press secretary said , but she brushed aside the notion that antiblackness is intrinsic to U.S. law enforcement . His National Security Adviser , Robert O ’ Brien , said racist police are just a “ few bad apples , ” adding , “ we need to root them out. ” Attorney General William Barr warned against “ automatically assuming that the actions of an individual necessarily mean that their organization is rotten . ”
But , for all that ’ s good about America , something is rotten . The protesters in Lafayette Park on June 1 may have been galvanized by the disturbing video of the murder of George Floyd , suffocated to death beneath the knee of a Minneapolis police officer just a week prior . But at the core of their movement is much more than the outrage over the latest instances of police brutality . Centuries of racist policy , both explicit and implicit , have left black Americans in the dust , physically , emotionally and economically . The U.S. may think it has brushed chattel slavery into the dustbin of history after the Civil War , but the country never did a very good job incinerating its traumatic remains , instead leaving embers that still burn today : an education system that fails black Americans , substandard health care that makes them more vulnerable to death and disease , and an economy that leaves millions without access to a living wage .
Politicians , activists and everyday people can and should debate what to do about this reality , but it is a reality , one evident in volumes of data , research and reporting , not to mention the lived experience of millions of African Americans each and every day . What is helping make this moment historic is that over these past weeks and months , much of the rest of the U.S. appears to have woken up to this truth too .
The crowds of protesters from Seattle to Miami include not just black youth , but a diverse array that looks something like the country itself . In 2015 , in the wake of unrest in Ferguson , Mo. , just half of Americans said they believed racial discrimination to be a “ big problem , ” and , in 2016 , only a third considered black Americans more likely to suffer from police brutality , according to Monmouth University polling . Today , by contrast , more than 75 % of Americans say discrimination is a big problem and 57 % understand that African Americans are more likely to suffer from police violence than other demographic groups are , a recent Monmouth poll found .
More broadly , the notion of “ systemic racism , ” once confined to academic and activist circles on the left of the spectrum , has become the phrase du jour , with Google searches for the term rising a hundredfold in a matter of months and mainstream conservatives like former President George W. Bush joining historically moderate Democrats like Joe Biden in embracing the term to call for a national reckoning .
This spreading recognition highlights an ever starker dividing line in America . On one side , a growing majority of the country is increasingly ready to repudiate its history of structural racism . On the other , many of those in power , especially at the White House , are eager to deny it . This is no surprise . By definition , systemic racism is embedded deep and wide across American society and , therefore , can ’ t easily be rectified . But , for many of those who have spent their lives fighting for racial justice , this is a moment of reckoning that has been a long time coming . “ Not everything that is faced can be changed , ” James Baldwin , the black author and activist wrote in the manuscript of his memoir Remember This House , “ but nothing can be changed until it is faced . ”

The origins of America ’ s unjust racial order lie in the most brutal institution of enslavement that human beings have ever concocted . More than 12 million Africans of all ages , shackled in the bottom of ships , were sold into a lifetime of forced labor defined by nonstop violence and strategic dehumanization , all cataloged methodically in sales receipts and ledgers . Around that “ peculiar institution , ” the thinkers of the time crafted an equally inhumane ideology to justify their brutality , using religious rhetoric in tandem with pseudoscience to rationalize treating humans as chattel . After the Civil War , the arrangements of legal slavery were replaced with those of organized , if not strictly legal , terror . Lynchings , disenfranchisement and indentured servitude all reinforced racial hierarchy from the period of Reconstruction through Jim Crow segregation and on until the movement for civil rights in the middle of the 20th century .
That ’ s the ugly history most Americans know and acknowledge . But systemic racism also found its way , more insidiously , into the institutions many Americans revere and seek to safe-guard . Established in the 1930s , Social Security helped ensure a stable old age for most Americans , but it initially excluded domestic and agricultural workers , leaving behind two-thirds of black Americans . Federal mortgage lending programs helped white Americans buy homes after World War II , but black Americans suffered from a shameful catch-22 . Federal policy said that the very presence of a black resident in a neighborhood reduced the value of the homes there , effectively prohibiting African-American residents from borrowing money to buy a home . And sentencing laws of the past several decades meant that poor black Americans were thrown in prison for decades-long terms for consuming one type of cocaine while their wealthier white counterparts got a slap on the wrist for consuming another .
There ’ s a straight line between these policies and the state of black America today . The lack of Social Security kept black Americans toiling in old age or forced them to the streets . The obstruction of black homeownership , among other factors , has left African Americans poorer and more economically vulnerable , with the average black household worth $ 17,000 in 2016 while the average white household was worth 10 times that . “ Tough on crime ” sentencing policies have ballooned the black prison population , torn apart families and left millions of children to grow up in single-parent homes .
This systemic discrimination is also a matter of life and death , and police violence , which kills hundreds of African Americans every year , is just the start . Look no further than the coronavirus pandemic . The neighborhoods in which black Americans often find themselves confined by a legacy of discriminatory policy are rife with pollution and , in many cases , lack even basic options for nutritious food . This leaves residents more likely to suffer from health ailments like asthma and diabetes , both of which increase the chances of poor outcomes for those infected with COVID-19 .
To actually capture all the ways in which the system is skewed against black people would require tome upon tome . But even a short list feels very long : black women are three to four times as likely as white women to die in childbirth , in part because of a lack of access to quality health care ; black children are more likely to attend underresourced schools , thanks to a reliance on local property taxes for funding ; black voters are four times as likely as white voters to report difficulties voting or engaging in politics than their white counterparts , in part because of laws that even today are designed to keep them for exercising their basic democratic rights ; millions more have been disenfranchised because of felony convictions ; hurricane flooding has been shown to hit black neighborhoods disproportionately .
Jeh Johnson , a lawyer who served as Obama ’ s Homeland Security Secretary and was recently tapped to help New York state courts conduct a racial bias review , explained it flatly . “ Defined broadly enough , one could say that there ’ s systemic racism across every institution in America , ” he told CNN recently .
With this in mind , it may come as little surprise that black Americans took to the streets in protest following the murder of George Floyd . Nearly 17 % of African Americans are unemployed . When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a surprise up-tick in jobs in May , the unemployment rate for African Americans in particular nevertheless remained on the rise . In the U.S. , black Americans are dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of their white counterparts . In some states , the disparity is even sharper .
What ’ s perhaps more surprising is that the rest of America is apparently waking up to these realities . For decades , the truth of systemic racism has always been swept under the rug , lest it make white Americans uncomfortable and hurt the electoral chances of those with the power to address it . In 1968 , the Kerner Commission , initiated by President Lyndon Johnson to study unrest in American cities insisted that “ white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto . White institutions created it , white institutions maintain it , and white society condones it. ” The results of the Commission were largely ignored .
During Barack Obama ’ s first presidential campaign , many Americans were outraged when news broke that the Rev . Jeremiah Wright , Obama ’ s pastor , had uttered the words “ God damn America ” for “ killing innocent people , ” “ treating our citizens as less than human ” and failing “ the vast majority of her citizens of African descent. ” Obama condemned the comments and reminded the public that , actually , the U.S. had made great progress , even while acknowledging far more was needed .
A horse-drawn carriage brought Floyd ’ s body into the cemetery on June 9 . “ It felt like a state funeral , ” Roye said . “ It felt like they were sending him off with the newfound persona that he had been catapulted into , and this was one of the ways to honor what he became . It felt right. ” Ruddy Roye for TIME
Today , the conversation is different , and one wonders whether such remarks , as salient now as they were then , would still be met with disavowal . The U.S. can not deny what is plainly before its eyes . Shocking videos depict George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery murdered in broad daylight . Tens of thousands of black lives have been taken by the coronavirus . And , in the midst of all this , the President fans the flames of racial tensions with dog whistles so unsubtle that even the most skeptical can hear them .
In urban centers , black and white protesters have come forward together in defiance , joined by allies like GOP Senator Mitt Romney and longtime Koch Industries executive Mark Holden . In predominantly white cities across the country , white Americans have shown up by the thousands in solidarity . Even small towns in rural parts of the country have joined in the protests .
A lot would need to change to address such deeply rooted bias . The first test may come this year as momentum grows in city halls , statehouses and Washington , D.C. , for reforms to root out police brutality , perhaps the most flagrant and visible injustice . “ Justice for George is something that many people who were killed through brutality of the police never get , ” says Benjamin Crump , a civil rights lawyer representing Floyd ’ s family . “ And that is a transformative justice , a systematic reform across the board . ”
Whatever the progress transpires in the coming months , the U.S. still has a long way to go . Last year , I happened to find myself in both Berlin and Charleston , S.C . In Berlin , where Adolf Hitler planned and oversaw the extermination of millions of Jews , it felt as though I couldn ’ t walk a few blocks without a memorial atoning for that sin . In Charleston , I fell asleep on a picturesque beach , only to learn later that the site was a key node in the Atlantic slave trade , where traders imported 40 % of enslaved Africans who came to North America . I spent the rest of the day feeling sick to my stomach , disgusted at the possibility that I had enjoyed a leisurely nap where , perhaps , one of my ancestors endured one of the most gruesome of human institutions .
Awakening can be painful . But in America , a reckoning is overdue .

Mayor Muriel Bowser this week over her decision to paint “ Black Lives Matter ” down two blocks of 16th Street , which leads to the White House , saying she violated the First Amendment and showed favoritism to “ the Black Lives Matter cult orthodoxy . ”
The lawsuit , filed in federal court on Wednesday , complained Ms. Bowser ’ s move , as well as her decision to rename a nearby street “ Black Lives Matter Plaza , ” came at the taxpayers ’ expense but showed a preference for one faith — or belief — over others .
The main argument in the 51-page complaint filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is that Ms. Bowser is violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution by supporting one orthodoxy over others .
“ The Black Lives Matter banner conveys that black people are the favored race of the city of DC , which is of course a racist contention floated by a racist Democrat who persistently refuses to think logically , ” the lawsuit said .
Pastor Rich Penkoski , identified as a “ street preacher ” is the named plaintiff in the case . He ’ s joined by Chris Sevier , a former judge advocate general , and Tex Christopher , a D.C. lobbyist .
The mayor ’ s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit .
The three plaintiffs asked the court to order Ms. Bowser to alternate other banners down the street so she is not showing favoritism to a preferred group .
The first suggested banner is “ Blue Lives Matter ” to honor law enforcement . The second banner requested is “ Green Lives Matter ” to honor Guard units . The third and final banner requested is “ All Lives Matter , ” which the activists said is “ secular ” and won ’ t run afoul of the 14th Amendment ’ s Equal Protection Clause .
The lawsuit comes about a week after Ms. Bowser had the street painted following weeks of protests in the nation ’ s capital after the killing of George Floyd , a black man , by a white police officer in Minneapolis over Memorial Day weekend . The officer has since been charged with second-degree murder .
“ There are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen , and to have their humanity recognized , and we had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city , ” Ms. Bowser told reporters last week about the protesters .
“ And it is that message , and that message is to the American people , that Black Lives Matter black humanity matters , and we as a city raise that up as part of our values as a city , ” she added .

Bates , a reserve deputy who is allowed to work on cases because he is a big donor to the sheriff 's office , was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter , after claiming that he meant to reach for a taser and not a gun .
As Harris lay struggling and dying , he told the surrounding officers , “ I ’ m losing my breath. ” One officer yelled back at him , “ Fuck your breath ! ” Then he insisted that the dying man be handcuffed .
“ Fuck your breath ! ” encapsulates in only three words the systemic disregard that police regularly show to Black people in America . Just last week , we watched Michael Slager execute Walter Scott in South Carolina for daring to run away . Now this week , we are also tuning into the trial of former Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin , who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd in March 2012 .

Figuring out how to let Black people live is apparently far more complicated .","On April 2 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a sheriff's deputy named Robert Bates shot and killed Eric Harris, a man fleeing a crime scene where he was about to be captured for selling illegal weapons. Bates, a reserve deputy who is allowed to work on cases because he is a big donor to the sheriff's office, was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter, after claiming that he meant to reach for a taser and not a gun.

As Harris lay struggling and dying, he told the surrounding officers, “I’m losing my breath.” One officer yelled back at him, “Fuck your breath!” Then he insisted that the dying man be handcuffed.

“Fuck your breath!” encapsulates in only three words the systemic disregard that police regularly show to Black people in America. Just last week, we watched Michael Slager execute Walter Scott in South Carolina for daring to run away. Now this week, we are also tuning into the trial of former Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd in March 2012. In the cases of Eric Garner in Staten Island, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Walter Scott in South Carolina, and Eric Harris in Tulsa, we have seen video of law enforcement officers not only critically injuring citizens but also refusing to administer medical care, with fatal consequences.

But amid the protests, different — but sometimes overlapping — proposals for how to address police violence have emerged, from reforming to defunding to dismantling to abolishing the police.

Reform

Police reform has often been the mainstream call in the wake of protests against police brutality. Reform, a long-term process that has usually involved putting more funding toward police, now tends to call for community policing, a style that encourages police to be assigned to specific communities and to know the residents and dynamics of the areas where they work. In his criminal justice plan, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, calls for allocating $300 million toward community policing, saying it's the model that makes policing work best.

Police reform also focuses on limiting officers' use of force and holding police accountable.

Defund

But many say reform doesn't work, arguing that police departments like Minneapolis' have already undergone reform and police violence still happens.

Instead, activists, organizers, scholars and city residents are furthering the call, demanding that police be defunded, often under a ""divest/invest"" model.

Those calling for defunding the police see the departments' budgets as bloated and misappropriated when other crucial city services have to beg for scraps.

Dismantling

""The plan has to start somewhere,"" he said. ""We are not going to hit the eject button without a plan, so today was the announcement of the formulation of that plan.""

Abolition

Then there's abolition, an often misunderstood framework to reimagine how society responds to harm. For some, defunding the police means just reducing their budgets, but for others it means taking a step toward abolition.

To abolish the police, Ritchie said, goes beyond slashing a budget and rejects policing and prisons as reformable institutions.

""Even if we trim the budget, if we ask them to do more beating with less money, we're still invested in policing as an action, institution and method of meeting need and reducing conflict,"" she said.

President Obama says Americans feel worse about race relations not because relations are worse , but because we 're talking about them more .
Obama offered that analysis during a year-ending NPR interview . In a 40-minute talk just before he left Washington for the holidays , he gave clues to his thinking about his final two years in office .
The president says he wanted 2014 to be a `` breakthrough year , '' when the economy would decisively improve and the nation 's toxic politics might improve too . Though the economy did grow , 2014 became another year of unexpected disasters and unplanned events . That surely contributed to the drop in Obama 's approval ratings , and left the president with little power to prevent his party 's loss of the Senate .
Of this year 's unexpected events , some of the most difficult and dramatic surrounded two police killings of black men in Ferguson , Mo. , and New York City . Yet in our talk on Dec. 18 , the president interpreted the widespread debate over the killings as a sign of potential positive change :
Two days after the president spoke of that healthy debate , a gunman murdered two New York City police officers .
The day of the interview , however , there already was other evidence of division in the country .
Obama offered an essentially optimistic view that better data for the public and better training for police can improve their interactions .

President Obama says Americans feel worse about race relations not because relations are worse, but because we're talking about them more.

Obama offered that analysis during a year-ending NPR interview. In a 40-minute talk just before he left Washington for the holidays, he gave clues to his thinking about his final two years in office.

The president says he wanted 2014 to be a ""breakthrough year,"" when the economy would decisively improve and the nation's toxic politics might improve too. Though the economy did grow, 2014 became another year of unexpected disasters and unplanned events. That surely contributed to the drop in Obama's approval ratings, and left the president with little power to prevent his party's loss of the Senate.

Of this year's unexpected events, some of the most difficult and dramatic surrounded two police killings of black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City. Yet in our talk on Dec. 18, the president interpreted the widespread debate over the killings as a sign of potential positive change:

Two days after the president spoke of that healthy debate, a gunman murdered two New York City police officers.

The day of the interview, however, there already was other evidence of division in the country.

Obama offered an essentially optimistic view that better data for the public and better training for police can improve their interactions.

He has assembled a task force to examine police and community relations, and said its members are ""interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country. And I'm convinced that we actually are going to see progress on this issue next year.""

Some other race-related data, on voting patterns, presents a challenge to the president's party. Obama twice won election on the strength of an unprecedented minority vote, and the share of minorities in the electorate is growing. But a flip side to this trend can be seen with white voters.

The collapse of the white vote won't be inevitably fatal for the Democratic Party; in the 2016 presidential election, nonwhite voters are expected to make up an even larger share of the electorate than they did in 2012.

But the drop-off was disastrous in the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. In a Senate race in Georgia, for example, it was estimated that Democrats needed little more than 25 percent of the white vote to win, but they failed to get it. This is why Republicans now dominate Congress and most state legislatures.

Edsall,"LaFleur Stephens-Dougan , a political scientist at Princeton and the author of “ Race to the Bottom : How Racial Appeals Work in American Politics , ” wrote me in an email :
Most Americans have a distorted definition of racism . We think of racism as person-to-person acts of prejudice — like using a slur . Such behavior is racist , but racism is far more than that . We have baked racism into our political institutions and economic systems .
It is important , Stephens-Dougan argues , to ask people why they think black and Latino neighborhoods struggle with poor school and higher levels of crime . “ If one ’ s answer , ” she continued , “ is that those neighborhoods are under-resourced because blacks and Latinos are less smart , less hardworking or less disciplined , etc. , then that answer is racist . ”
Ryan Enos , a political scientist at Harvard , applies what he calls the “ ‘ Golden Rule of Intergroup Relations ’ — which means that if you would be upset if somebody did something to or said something about your own group , then it is bigotry if you say it about or do it to another group . ”
Ashley Jardina , a political scientist at Duke and the author of “ White Identity Politics , ” put it this way :
The use of these terms is complicated , messy , and without consensus . There are a number of important distinctions we can make . We think of ‘ racial prejudice ’ as an individual-level sense of hostility , animus , set of negative stereotypes , or other negative attitudes that one person has toward members of a group by way of their race . We refer to a person as racist when they have some degree of racial prejudice . For most Americans , this is generally what they think of when they hear the term racism or racist . A racist is a person who uses racial slurs directed at racial out-groups and thinks their own racial group is superior .
Let ’ s turn back to Darren Davis of Notre Dame . I asked Davis and other scholars whether Asian-American protests in New York City against the potential elimination of entrance exams as the sole determinant of entry into selective high schools like Stuyvesant or Bronx Science were racist . Likewise , is the opposition of well off suburbanites to affordable housing in their neighborhoods racist ? Is the number of African-Americans in prison evidence of racism ? And is white opposition to the decarceration movement , or to the prison abolition movement , racist ?
Davis stresses that , in his view , “ not all racialized behavior and expressions stem from racial hatred or hating African Americans. ” He is cautious in his wording :
Ordinary citizens , without being racists themselves , may do and say things that are consistent with a racist ideology . It does not make the outcomes any less egregious or harmful . For instance , Asian-Americans protesting NYC school proposals is not necessarily racist in my opinion because I can see other motivations driving the support for higher standards — not just beliefs about the inferiority of others .
Davis argues that the debate has become clouded , that even though individual and group motives may not be racist , the outcomes achieved can be identical to the ones that racists would seek :
My overall point is that we have forgotten what racism means . In doing so , we have focused attention on bigots and white nationalists and not held ordinary citizens accountable for beliefs that achieve the same ends .
President Trump ’ s or Steve King ’ s comments about certain types of immigrants being unassimilable or not sufficiently American and suggesting that other ( e.g . white ) immigrants do not have those characteristics .
While both Trump and King , an anti-immigrant congressman from Iowa , “ balk at the label ‘ racist , ’ she continued , “ it is descriptively accurate and necessary from the standpoint of keeping track of the role and uses of racism in American society and politics . ”
Like Davis , Thurston sought to address “ the more difficult question ” of “ when it is legitimate to use that label for everyday behaviors . ”
People can participate in and perpetuate racist systems without necessarily subscribing to those beliefs . People can recognize something they participate in or contribute to as racist but decide it ’ s not disqualifying . And people can design racist policies and systems . These are distinctive manifestations of racism but not all of them require us to know whether a person is expressly motivated by racism .
Cindy Kam — a political scientist at Vanderbilt , and a co-author with Camille Burge , a political scientist at Villanova , of “ Uncovering Reactions to the Racial Resentment Scale Across the Racial Divide ” — added another element to the discussion : wariness about how the word is used in political and policy debates :
As a social scientist , I would entertain the possibility that people ’ s actions are guided by a variety of motivations , potentially including racial considerations but also values ( i.e. , a commitment to a free market ; egalitarianism ; moral conservatism ) ; economic considerations ; self-interest ( concerns about my child ’ s ability to get into a high school or my child ’ s commute to a faraway school ) , or even factual beliefs .
Because of the wide variety of possible motivations , Kam wrote in her email , she “ would hesitate to label an action as ‘ racist ’ — unless racial considerations seem to be the only or the massively determinative consideration at play , based upon statistical modeling or carefully calibrated experiments . ”
Kam notes that she worries “ about excessive use of these labels ” because describing someone or some action as racist “ can easily escalate conflict beyond the point of return . ”","LaFleur Stephens-Dougan, a political scientist at Princeton and the author of “Race to the Bottom: How Racial Appeals Work in American Politics,” wrote me in an email:

Chloe Thurston, in turn, cited as specific examples

President Trump’s or Steve King’s comments about certain types of immigrants being unassimilable or not sufficiently American and suggesting that other (e.g. white) immigrants do not have those characteristics.

While both Trump and King, an anti-immigrant congressman from Iowa, “balk at the label ‘racist,’ she continued, “it is descriptively accurate and necessary from the standpoint of keeping track of the role and uses of racism in American society and politics.”

Like Davis, Thurston sought to address “the more difficult question” of “when it is legitimate to use that label for everyday behaviors.”

Her answer:

People can participate in and perpetuate racist systems without necessarily subscribing to those beliefs. People can recognize something they participate in or contribute to as racist but decide it’s not disqualifying. And people can design racist policies and systems.

Couple spoke about role of race in America

They're the most powerful couple in the country but President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama say they're sometimes still treated like the help.

Speaking to People Magazine , the first lady recounts a trip to Target when a fellow customer asked for assistance with an item -- not recognizing her as the wife of the President of the United States.

""She didn't see me as the first lady, she saw me as someone who could help her,"" Mrs. Obama said. ""Those kinds of things happen in life. So it isn't anything new.""

The president said he -- like many African-American men -- had been mistaken for a valet.

""There's no black male my age, who's a professional, who hasn't come out of a restaurant and is waiting for their car and somebody didn't hand them their car keys,"" he told the magazine.

Obama said those indignities don't compare to the violent struggle for equal rights waged a generation ago. But he said it's concerning when law enforcement regards African-American men with undue suspicion.

""It's one thing for me to be mistaken for a waiter at a gala. It's another thing for my son to be mistaken for a robber and to be handcuffed, or worse, if he happens to be walking down the street and is dressed the way teenagers dress,"" he said.

The Obamas comments come after a spate of incidents that involve police and race -- in two cases, grand juries failed to indict police officers responsible for the deaths of unarmed black men, leading to angry protests.

While a recent study shows black Americans give high marks to the news media ’ s coverage of the protests , a survey conducted before the protests found deep divides between racial and ethnic groups in feelings of how the news media represent them .
While most Americans say that the news media do not understand them , black , Hispanic and white Americans often cite very different reasons for why they are misunderstood , according to a ███ survey conducted Feb. 18-March 2 , 2020 .
Overall , 59 % of Americans think news organizations do not understand people like them , while a minority – 37 % – say they do feel understood . This feeling is about on par with the last time the question was asked in 2018 .
This analysis of Americans ’ feelings about how news organizations misunderstand people like them is based on a survey of 10,300 U.S. adults conducted Feb. 18 to March 2 , 2020 . Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of ███ ’ s American Trends Panel , an online survey panel that is recruited through national , random sampling of residential addresses . Recruiting our panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection . This gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole population ( see our Methods 101 explainer on random sampling ) . To further ensure that each survey reflects a balanced cross section of the nation , the data is weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender , race , ethnicity , partisan affiliation , education and other categories . Here are the questions asked for this analysis , along with responses , and its methodology . This analysis was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts , which received support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation .
While no one reason dominates when looking at all Americans , sizable gaps exist between racial and ethnic groups in why they feel misunderstood . Roughly similar portions of black ( 58 % ) , Hispanic ( 55 % ) and white Americans ( 61 % ) say the news media misunderstand them , but they cite markedly different reasons for this misunderstanding .
Black Americans are far more likely than the other two groups to feel that the misunderstanding is based on their race or some other demographic trait . Among black adults who think the news media do not understand people like them , about a third ( 34 % ) say the main way they are misunderstood is their personal characteristics . This is far higher than the 10 % of white adults and 17 % of Hispanic adults who say the same .
White Americans , on the other hand , are far more likely than the other groups to say the problem stems from political misunderstandings . Of white adults who say news organizations misunderstand them , nearly four-in-ten ( 39 % ) say it ’ s mostly based on their political views . About a quarter of Hispanic Americans say the same , and both groups are higher than black Americans ( 15 % ) .
Hispanic Americans are somewhat more likely than the other two groups to think that their personal interests are what is misunderstood most ( 26 % , compared with 16 % of black and 17 % of white adults ) . In a 2019 study , U.S. adults living in areas with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents were somewhat less likely to feel a connection to local journalists and news organizations , such as through speaking to a journalist .
All three racial or ethnic groups are about on par in thinking that the news media misunderstand their social and economic class .
A similar question was posed to those who feel the news media do understand them , asking how they are most understood , and again , no single reason dominates . ( For more details , you can find a link to the questions and responses in “ How we did this ” ) . But on this question , the divides by race and ethnicity are often not nearly as large .
Divides do emerge between political parties and other demographic groups in whether they feel news organizations understand them . For instance , Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are far more likely to feel the news media misunderstand them than Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 73 % vs. 47 % ) . Male U.S. adults are somewhat more likely than female adults to feel this , and those ages 18 to 29 are more likely to say this than those older than them .
Divides between the parties and demographic groups also emerge when it comes to why they feel misunderstood , though these divides are often not as large as by race and ethnicity , particularly when it comes to the feeling that their personal characteristics are misunderstood .
For instance , Republicans who feel news organizations misunderstand them are far more likely to say their political views are most misunderstood , while Democrats are somewhat more likely to cite their social class , personal interests and personal characteristics .
Americans 50 years of age and older are more likely to cite their political views , while those younger than that are more likely to think their personal interests are misunderstood . Those with a household income of $ 75,000 or higher are less likely to cite social class , but more likely to say political views than those with a lower household income .","Tensions inside American newsrooms have emerged amid the recent protests over the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, including clashes between reporters and editors and concerns about newsroom diversity.

This analysis was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which received support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

While no one reason dominates when looking at all Americans, sizable gaps exist between racial and ethnic groups in why they feel misunderstood. Roughly similar portions of black (58%), Hispanic (55%) and white Americans (61%) say the news media misunderstand them, but they cite markedly different reasons for this misunderstanding.

Black Americans are far more likely than the other two groups to feel that the misunderstanding is based on their race or some other demographic trait. Among black adults who think the news media do not understand people like them, about a third (34%) say the main way they are misunderstood is their personal characteristics. This is far higher than the 10% of white adults and 17% of Hispanic adults who say the same.

White Americans, on the other hand, are far more likely than the other groups to say the problem stems from political misunderstandings. Of white adults who say news organizations misunderstand them, nearly four-in-ten (39%) say it’s mostly based on their political views. About a quarter of Hispanic Americans say the same, and both groups are higher than black Americans (15%).

Hispanic Americans are somewhat more likely than the other two groups to think that their personal interests are what is misunderstood most (26%, compared with 16% of black and 17% of white adults). In a 2019 study, U.S. adults living in areas with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents were somewhat less likely to feel a connection to local journalists and news organizations, such as through speaking to a journalist.

All three racial or ethnic groups are about on par in thinking that the news media misunderstand their social and economic class.

A similar question was posed to those who feel the news media do understand them, asking how they are most understood, and again, no single reason dominates. (For more details, you can find a link to the questions and responses in “How we did this”). But on this question, the divides by race and ethnicity are often not nearly as large.

Divides do emerge between political parties and other demographic groups in whether they feel news organizations understand them. For instance, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are far more likely to feel the news media misunderstand them than Democrats and Democratic leaners (73% vs. 47%). Male U.S. adults are somewhat more likely than female adults to feel this, and those ages 18 to 29 are more likely to say this than those older than them.

Divides between the parties and demographic groups also emerge when it comes to why they feel misunderstood, though these divides are often not as large as by race and ethnicity, particularly when it comes to the feeling that their personal characteristics are misunderstood.

For instance, Republicans who feel news organizations misunderstand them are far more likely to say their political views are most misunderstood, while Democrats are somewhat more likely to cite their social class, personal interests and personal characteristics.

Americans 50 years of age and older are more likely to cite their political views, while those younger than that are more likely to think their personal interests are misunderstood. Those with a household income of $75,000 or higher are less likely to cite social class, but more likely to say political views than those with a lower household income.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Undeterred by curfews , protesters streamed back into the nation ’ s streets Tuesday , hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd ’ s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “ lowlifes and losers . ”
But most protests passed peacefully , and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City , the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier , when violence swept through multiple cities .

WEST POINT . N.Y. ( AP ) — As the nation continues to grapple with its racial past , President Donald Trump urged West Point ’ s graduating class Saturday to “ never forget ” the legacy of soldiers before them who fought a bloody war to “ extinguish the evil of slavery . ”
Trump ’ s appeal to remember history came as his own relationship with the military is under strain from the unrelenting criticism he and Pentagon leaders have faced over their response to protests that erupted after George Floyd ’ s death in Minneapolis .
It also came hours after Trump made what amounted to a rare concession for him : He rescheduled a campaign rally planned for Tulsa , Oklahoma , on June 19 . The day marks the end of slavery in the U.S. , and Tulsa was the scene of a fiery white-on-black attack in 1921 .
“ What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment , ” Trump told more than 1,100 graduates at an unusual outdoor ceremony held during a pandemic . “ When times are turbulent , when the road is rough , what matters most is that which is permanent , timeless , enduring and eternal . ”
In the past two weeks , Trump has yelled at Defense Secretary Mark Esper for publicly opposing his call to deploy active-duty troops to quell the protests stemming from the killing of Floyd , who was black , by a white Minneapolis police officer .
Trump also shut down Esper ’ s attempt to begin a public debate on removing the names of Confederate Army officers — some of whom trained at West Point — from military bases , an idea gaining momentum across the country .

Milley ’ s comments amounted to an extraordinary expression of regret by Trump ’ s chief military adviser , who said his appearance led to the perception of the military becoming embroiled in politics , which in his view — one shared by Esper — is a threat to democracy .
The events have stirred debate within the military and among retired officers . More than 500 West Point graduates from classes spanning six decades signed an open letter reminding the Class of 2020 of its commitment to avoid partisan politics .
The letter , published this week on Medium , also alluded to the problems Esper and Milley encountered at the White House after Floyd ’ s death .
“ Sadly , the government has threatened to use the Army in which you serve as a weapon against fellow Americans engaging in these legitimate protests , ” they wrote . “ Worse , military leaders , who took the same oath you take today , have participated in politically charged events . The principle of civilian control is central to the military profession . But that principle does not imply blind obedience . ”
During the commencement ceremony , protesters denounced the president from boats and kayaks along the nearby Hudson River .
Trump also used his first West Point address to remind the newly commissioned officers of the academy ’ s history and storied generals like Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower .
“ It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence , ” Trump said . He said the U.S. Military Academy “ gave us the men and women who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding . ’ ’
“ This is your history . This is the legacy that each of you inherits , ” Trump continued , adding that it was bought with American blood spilled in battle . “ You must never forget it . ”
Trump , however , was incorrect to say women had been trained at West Point for the anti-slavery fight ; they were not allowed to become cadets until 1976 .
His remarks also overlooked numerous West Point graduates who served in the Confederacy , including President Jefferson Davis , Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Braxton Bragg . Some are now seeking the removal of Bragg ’ s name from North Carolina ’ s Fort Bragg .
In the speech , Trump leaned into his “ America first ” brand of foreign policy without uttering the phrase , telling the Army ’ s newest officers their job is “ not to rebuild foreign nations , but to defend and defend strongly our nation from our foreign enemies . ”
“ It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never heard of. ” He said America is not the “ policeman of the world , ” but warned adversaries that it will “ never , ever hesitate ” to act when its people are threatened .
He thanked those in the military who helped the country respond to the coronavirus , once again calling it an “ invisible enemy ” from China .
The president stressed the unity of a graduating class that came “ from every race , religion , color and creed. ” The class also includes citizens of 11 other countries , including Bosnia-Herzegovina , South Korea and Tanzania .
Trump highlighted bigger defense budgets under his watch but falsely said he had destroyed 100 % of the Islamic State caliphate in the Middle East ; the group still poses a threat to the U.S . He noted he had directed the killing of two terrorist leaders and had created the Space Force .
Trump also remembered a cadet who died in an accident last year and whose father is a Secret Service agent , and noted that both he and the Army share a birthday Sunday . Trump will turn 74 , while the Army marks its 254th year of existence .
Esper did not attend , but emphasized the principles of duty , honor and country in a video message , saying they will help guide the new officers “ in challenging times and in the face of new and emerging threats . ”
Trump ’ s appearance at West Point had been criticized as a political move that would put the graduates at risk since the academy is located up the Hudson River from New York City , the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak .
The Army defended the move , saying the cadets had to return to campus anyway for final medical checks , equipment and training . They had been home since spring break in early March ..
For the ceremony , the newly commissioned second lieutenants wore face masks as they marched onto the parade field , but removed them after sitting for the socially distant ceremony required by the pandemic .
Instead of shaking hands with the president , they exchanged salutes . Family and friends were not allowed to attend and had to watch online .
At the end of the ceremony , five hulking helicopters flew low and slow over the field as the graduates tossed their white dress caps into the air .","President Donald Trump has urged West Point’s graduating class to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them who fought a bloody war to end slavery

WEST POINT. N.Y. (AP) — As the nation continues to grapple with its racial past, President Donald Trump urged West Point’s graduating class Saturday to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them who fought a bloody war to “extinguish the evil of slavery.”

Trump’s appeal to remember history came as his own relationship with the military is under strain from the unrelenting criticism he and Pentagon leaders have faced over their response to protests that erupted after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.

It also came hours after Trump made what amounted to a rare concession for him: He rescheduled a campaign rally planned for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. The day marks the end of slavery in the U.S., and Tulsa was the scene of a fiery white-on-black attack in 1921.

“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Trump told more than 1,100 graduates at an unusual outdoor ceremony held during a pandemic. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”

In the past two weeks, Trump has yelled at Defense Secretary Mark Esper for publicly opposing his call to deploy active-duty troops to quell the protests stemming from the killing of Floyd, who was black, by a white Minneapolis police officer.

Trump also shut down Esper’s attempt to begin a public debate on removing the names of Confederate Army officers — some of whom trained at West Point — from military bases, an idea gaining momentum across the country.

Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, risked Trump’s ire Thursday by declaring he had made “a mistake” by accompanying Trump on a June 1 walk through Lafayette Square. It ended with the president posing with a Bible outside a boarded-up St. John’s Church.

Milley’s comments amounted to an extraordinary expression of regret by Trump’s chief military adviser, who said his appearance led to the perception of the military becoming embroiled in politics, which in his view — one shared by Esper — is a threat to democracy.

Trump also used his first West Point address to remind the newly commissioned officers of the academy’s history and storied generals like Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence,” Trump said. He said the U.S. Military Academy “gave us the men and women who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding.’’

“This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits,” Trump continued, adding that it was bought with American blood spilled in battle. “You must never forget it.”

Trump, however, was incorrect to say women had been trained at West Point for the anti-slavery fight; they were not allowed to become cadets until 1976.

His remarks also overlooked numerous West Point graduates who served in the Confederacy, including President Jefferson Davis, Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Braxton Bragg. Some are now seeking the removal of Bragg’s name from North Carolina’s Fort Bragg.

In the speech, Trump leaned into his “America first” brand of foreign policy without uttering the phrase, telling the Army’s newest officers their job is “not to rebuild foreign nations, but to defend and defend strongly our nation from our foreign enemies.”

“It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never heard of.” He said America is not the “policeman of the world,” but warned adversaries that it will “never, ever hesitate” to act when its people are threatened.

He thanked those in the military who helped the country respond to the coronavirus, once again calling it an “invisible enemy” from China.

The president stressed the unity of a graduating class that came “from every race, religion, color and creed.” The class also includes citizens of 11 other countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Korea and Tanzania.

Trump highlighted bigger defense budgets under his watch but falsely said he had destroyed 100% of the Islamic State caliphate in the Middle East; the group still poses a threat to the U.S. He noted he had directed the killing of two terrorist leaders and had created the Space Force.

Trump also remembered a cadet who died in an accident last year and whose father is a Secret Service agent, and noted that both he and the Army share a birthday Sunday. Trump will turn 74, while the Army marks its 254th year of existence.

Esper did not attend, but emphasized the principles of duty, honor and country in a video message, saying they will help guide the new officers “in challenging times and in the face of new and emerging threats.”

Trump’s appearance at West Point had been criticized as a political move that would put the graduates at risk since the academy is located up the Hudson River from New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak.

The Army defended the move, saying the cadets had to return to campus anyway for final medical checks, equipment and training. They had been home since spring break in early March..

For the ceremony, the newly commissioned second lieutenants wore face masks as they marched onto the parade field, but removed them after sitting for the socially distant ceremony required by the pandemic.

Instead of shaking hands with the president, they exchanged salutes. Family and friends were not allowed to attend and had to watch online.

At the end of the ceremony, five hulking helicopters flew low and slow over the field as the graduates tossed their white dress caps into the air.

Irving has organized a coalition of players who range from hesitant to militantly opposed to restarting the NBA season during the ongoing pandemic as sequestered employees in a bubble in Orlando.

But others, including Irving, have a different reason not to take the court right now: the national movement against racist police violence. These players think the issues of racial justice and stopping police violence are so pressing at the moment that the NBA runs the risk of becoming a distraction to the movement in the streets.

Trump seized on the moment of infighting to weaponize Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks: “Whenever confronted, they call their adversaries, including Nancy Pelosi, ‘RACIST,’ ” he tweeted on Sunday.

There persists a wrongheaded and entrenched wisdom among politicians and élite journalists that to call something racist is to violate etiquette. “Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,” a Times headline about the tweets read on Sunday. It was Charles Blow’s opinion piece, titled “Trump’s Tweets Prove That He Is a Raging Racist,” that spoke objectively. Pelosi’s disapproval of the tactics of the Squad has to do with the preservation of an establishment style, the old guard attempting to rein in the new. But Trump’s attacks test the stubbornness of entrenched mores. House Democrats are preparing a resolution to formally condemn Trump’s tweets; its text begins by referring to “President Trump’s racist comments directed at Members of Congress.” This is not only condemnatory but also plainly descriptive. Too much superstition attends the deployment of “racist.” The bar for its just use isn’t very high to clear.",www.newyorker.com,left,GDqQI58VAIxdBgh3

The satisfaction of swinging the hammer has nothing to do with race or class. If kids in the richest, whitest part of the Twin Cities were invited to whale away at a surplus cashier’s scanner, or most anything else, there would be plenty of takers. Riots become riots because the initial violence gives a kind of permission to indulge the limbic urge to destroy. Breaking windows is contagious; so is setting fires, upending cars and emptying store shelves.

For this reason, the time to stop a riot is not when flames are dancing to the crash and tinkle of shattering glass. Riots must be stopped before they happen. It’s all about prevention. Nearly six years after Ferguson — and close to 55 years after the Watts riots in Los Angeles — the United States still has not taken the obvious preventive measure of consistent, top-to-bottom police reform.

We ask a lot of police officers. They deserve gratitude and respect when they do their jobs well. But they can’t police our streets if they can’t police themselves first. The public has every right to expect police to discipline themselves and one another.

Video of a Minneapolis policeman kneeling on the neck of a prostrate, handcuffed, dying George Floyd, pressing his considerable weight down with a bland, almost bored look on his face, has drawn condemnation from police departments across the country, as Tom Jackman wrote in The Post. Perhaps that’s progress. But what matters more than those distant denunciations is the ho-hum attitude of the officer standing next to the homicide in progress, and the failure of two other officers at the scene to intervene.

And Minneapolis needs to ask why this department was ever acceptable to the community. Relations between police and citizens of color have been bad for years; this isn’t the first death, and these aren’t the first protests. Yet only one in every 100 citizen complaints leads to disciplinary action. Why have voters tolerated that?

The spread of protests to cities far from Minneapolis is a sign that genuine police reform remains unfinished business from coast to coast. The public must demand it — but only the police can achieve it, by rooting out, rather than covering for, the bad cops in their midst.

Do this with sincere and sustained commitment, do it with energy and pride, and future riots will be prevented. Continued failure to face the issue, however, will only unleash more anarchy and mayhem, as justified protests boil over into senseless, visceral violence.

MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody .
Based on the video , Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd . The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd ’ s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement . The officer does not move for at least eight minutes , even after Floyd stops speaking and moving .
“ I ’ ve wrestled with , more than anything else over the last 36 hours , one fundamental question : Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail ? ” said Frey , who is white .
He later added : “ I saw no threat . I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary . ”
The day after Floyd died , Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store .

Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump , a prominent civil rights lawyer , called for peaceful protests .
“ We can not sink to the level of our oppressors , and we must not endanger others during this pandemic , ” Crump said in a statement . “ We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice . ”
Police Chief Medaria Arradondo , who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer , urged protesters to “ be respectful. ” He said he was working to change the department ’ s culture .
“ One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that , ” he said .
The chief defended the department ’ s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night ’ s protests , saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons .
Gov . Tim Walz and Minnesota ’ s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington , both black — promised a thorough , transparent investigation .

race_and_racism,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/trump-attack-progressive-congresswomen-1416579,Trump: My tweets 'were NOT Racist',2019-07-16,Quint Forgey,"President Donald Trump asserted Tuesday that his recent tweets targeting a quartet of progressive congresswomen `` were NOT Racist , '' and urged Republican lawmakers to vote against a House resolution formally condemning the incendiary posts .
`` Those Tweets were NOT Racist . I don ’ t have a Racist bone in my body ! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game . Republicans should not show 'weakness ' and fall into their trap , '' the president wrote online . `` This should be a vote on the filthy language , statements and lies told by the Democrat ... Congresswomen , who I truly believe , based on their actions , hate our Country . ''
Trump also tweeted that the four lawmakers — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) , Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) , Ayanna Pressley ( D-Mass . ) and Rashida Tlaib ( D-Mich. ) — are now `` forever wedded to the Democrat Party '' despite efforts by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) `` to push them away , '' warning : `` See you in 2020 ! ''
The House is expected to take up a measure Tuesday evening denouncing `` President Trump 's racist comments directed at Members of Congress . '' Trump on Sunday wrote on Twitter that the congresswomen should `` go back ” to where they came from , even though three of the four — Ocasio-Cortez , Pressley and Tlaib — were born in the U.S. and Omar , a refugee from Somalia , has been a citizen since she was 17 .
Earlier Tuesday , Trump had carried his tirade against the freshman lawmakers into its third day , tweeting that the House should move to rebuke them for `` spewing some of the most vile , hateful , and disgusting things ever said by a politician '' in Congress , and complaining that they `` get a free pass and a big embrace '' from the Democratic Party .
“ Horrible anti-Israel , anti-USA , pro-terrorist & public shouting of the F ... word , among many other terrible things , and the petrified Dems run for the hills , ” Trump continued . “ Why isn ’ t the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said ? Because they are the Radical Left , and the Democrats are afraid to take them on . Sad ! ”
Roughly an hour later , Trump wrote online : `` Our Country is Free , Beautiful and Very Successful . If you hate our Country , or if you are not happy here , you can leave ! ''
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) on Tuesday dismissed the Democrats ' resolution as `` all politics , '' telling reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill that he will vote against the measure and encourage his GOP members to do the same .
McCarthy added that he did not believe Trump 's tweets were racist , and claimed the heated debate over the posts within Washington `` is about ideology . ''
Senior administration and West Wing officials also sought Tuesday to back the president and besmirch the congresswomen . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had `` never seen '' race play a role in Trump 's decision-making , and slammed the freshman lawmakers ' foreign policy outlook .
`` We are a force for good in the world , not a force for evil , '' Pompeo told CBN News . `` We are not the cause of these conflicts , and I hear these members of Congress talk about this as if America had generated this trouble . And to blame America first for these things is deeply inconsistent with not only our founding and our tradition , but with the facts on the ground . ''
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway accused Democrats of too frequently hurling charges of `` racism , sexism [ and ] xenophobia , '' and mocked the congresswomen 's record of legislative achievement .
`` These four people in the so-called 'squad ' — that have done squat in Congress other than pose on magazine covers and go on late night comedy shows and cause trouble in their own caucus — were under fire a couple short days ago by senior Democrats , elected officials , '' Conway told Fox News .
After first launching his criticism Sunday , Trump escalated the offensive on social media through Monday , culminating in explosive remarks to the media outside the White House during which he alleged the four congresswomen “ hate ” America “ with a passion. ” The lawmakers responded in a press conference later in the day , defending their patriotism , advocating for liberal policy proposals and calling for the president ’ s impeachment .
Trump ’ s racist language regarding the congresswomen and attempts to brand them as ideologically representative of the Democratic Party have served to unify Pelosi ’ s caucus , which became consumed last week by infighting between more moderate lawmakers and progressives including Ocasio-Cortez , Omar , Pressley and Tlaib .
Asked Tuesday afternoon where the congresswomen should go if they leave the U.S. , Trump responded that `` it 's up to them '' to decide . `` They can do what they want . They can leave .

''","During remarks to reporters outside the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump insisted that the four congresswomen “hate” America “with a passion.” | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Trump: My tweets 'were NOT Racist' The president carried his tirade against four freshman lawmakers into its third day.

President Donald Trump asserted Tuesday that his recent tweets targeting a quartet of progressive congresswomen ""were NOT Racist,"" and urged Republican lawmakers to vote against a House resolution formally condemning the incendiary posts.

""Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show 'weakness' and fall into their trap,"" the president wrote online. ""This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat ... Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country.""

Trump also tweeted that the four lawmakers — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) — are now ""forever wedded to the Democrat Party"" despite efforts by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ""to push them away,"" warning: ""See you in 2020!""

The House is expected to take up a measure Tuesday evening denouncing ""President Trump's racist comments directed at Members of Congress."" Trump on Sunday wrote on Twitter that the congresswomen should ""go back” to where they came from, even though three of the four — Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib — were born in the U.S. and Omar, a refugee from Somalia, has been a citizen since she was 17.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump had carried his tirade against the freshman lawmakers into its third day, tweeting that the House should move to rebuke them for ""spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician"" in Congress, and complaining that they ""get a free pass and a big embrace"" from the Democratic Party.

“Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro-terrorist & public shouting of the F...word, among many other terrible things, and the petrified Dems run for the hills,” Trump continued . “Why isn’t the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!”

Roughly an hour later, Trump wrote online: ""Our Country is Free, Beautiful and Very Successful. If you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave!""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Tuesday dismissed the Democrats' resolution as ""all politics,"" telling reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill that he will vote against the measure and encourage his GOP members to do the same.

McCarthy added that he did not believe Trump's tweets were racist, and claimed the heated debate over the posts within Washington ""is about ideology.""

Senior administration and West Wing officials also sought Tuesday to back the president and besmirch the congresswomen. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had ""never seen"" race play a role in Trump's decision-making, and slammed the freshman lawmakers' foreign policy outlook.

""We are a force for good in the world, not a force for evil,"" Pompeo told CBN News. ""We are not the cause of these conflicts, and I hear these members of Congress talk about this as if America had generated this trouble. And to blame America first for these things is deeply inconsistent with not only our founding and our tradition, but with the facts on the ground.""

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway accused Democrats of too frequently hurling charges of ""racism, sexism [and] xenophobia,"" and mocked the congresswomen's record of legislative achievement.

""These four people in the so-called 'squad' — that have done squat in Congress other than pose on magazine covers and go on late night comedy shows and cause trouble in their own caucus — were under fire a couple short days ago by senior Democrats, elected officials,"" Conway told Fox News.

'The squad' hits back at Trump after tweetstorm

After first launching his criticism Sunday, Trump escalated the offensive on social media through Monday, culminating in explosive remarks to the media outside the White House during which he alleged the four congresswomen “hate” America “with a passion.” The lawmakers responded in a press conference later in the day, defending their patriotism, advocating for liberal policy proposals and calling for the president’s impeachment.

Trump’s racist language regarding the congresswomen and attempts to brand them as ideologically representative of the Democratic Party have served to unify Pelosi’s caucus, which became consumed last week by infighting between more moderate lawmakers and progressives including Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib.

Asked Tuesday afternoon where the congresswomen should go if they leave the U.S., Trump responded that ""it's up to them"" to decide. ""They can do what they want. They can leave. They can stay. But they should love our country,"" the president told reporters during a meeting of his Cabinet.

Trump also declined to answer whether he would be willing to stop telling American citizens to return to foreign countries.

""It's my opinion they hate our country,"" he said of the congresswomen. ""And that's not good. It’s not acceptable.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), breaking his silence on the controversy later Tuesday, insisted ""the president is not a racist"" but offered a gentle scolding of Trump as well as congressional Democrats.

Under Obama , racial hope , no change
Six years ago , Barack Obama ’ s election was going to usher in a new era of racial understanding .
That hasn ’ t happened . Few , if any , anticipated that the man whose election itself was historic would be in a constant lose-lose situation as president when it came to race .
The protests and violence in Ferguson , Missouri , following the police shooting of Michael Brown have crystallized a larger sense within the African-American community , and civil rights leaders say they feel they ’ re a long way from Grant Park and a lot closer to “ here we go again ” on the Trayvon Martin shooting .
“ Things got somewhat better because the country felt proud of itself for electing him . But I certainly think they ’ re worse than they were on Jan. 20 , 2009 , ” said National Urban League President Marc Morial . “ There was a sense that the country had turned the corner . I think today there may be a sense that that progress has been a proverbial step forward and two steps back . ”
The economic divide , accentuated by the recession , has only widened the racial divide — the number of African-Americans who lost their own houses during the mortgage crisis , among other factors , appears to have done more to shape where race relations stand than having the first African-American in the White House . In 1950 , the workforce participation among young black men was 65.2 percent . In 2012 , it was 35.7 percent .
That ’ s not helped by many neighborhoods — Ferguson included — remaining either white or black , with little interaction between them .
“ There are so many communities where you still have persistent patterns of segregation , ” said Tom Perez , the Labor secretary and the former head of the Justice Department ’ s Civil Rights Division . “ It leads to a lack of understanding , and that is unfortunate , and that can have ill consequences . ”
African-American and civil rights leaders say this tension has been heightened by conservatives ’ opposition to Obama that they believe has been waged on racial grounds , along with measures like voter ID laws they say are meant to keep minorities from the polls .
No one expected Obama to change 400 years of legacy in a term and a half as president . But Obama took a very cautious approach in his first term , largely avoiding the topic , leading black leaders to complain that they were watching their gains erode under a president who took their support for granted . The outrage that caught the White House by surprise after he said police “ acted stupidly ” in Henry Louis Gates ’ 2009 arrest only helped solidify the West Wing ’ s hands-off approach .
“ He wanted to be perceived in a color-blind way , but the way he went about that was giving short shrift to African-Americans so that he wouldn ’ t be perceived as hung up on race , ” said Paul Butler , a former DOJ prosecutor who ’ s now a professor at Georgetown Law . “ One of the problems for people who don ’ t want to be perceived as hung up on race is that they end up obsessed with it . ”
“ These are flashpoints , ” said Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen , discussing the recent incidents and the violence they ’ ve sparked . “ The country is very , very fragile along the fault line of race . ”
An Associated Press poll right before Obama ’ s reelection indicated racial prejudice had ticked up during his first term , showing that 51 percent of Americans expressed anti-black sentiments , compared with 48 percent in 2008 , and 56 percent demonstrated implicit anti-black sentiments , compared with 49 percent four years earlier .
( From ███ Magazine : Why Jay Nixon missed his moment )
That sense appears to have been heightened in recent weeks with a string of high-profile deaths of minority men at the hands of police : Eric Garner in New York , Ezell Ford in Los Angeles , and another man in St. Louis on Tuesday afternoon . Saturday , Brown ’ s parents were in New York for a major march protesting Garner ’ s choking — an incident that ’ s consumed passions there for weeks , albeit without the violence that erupted in Ferguson .
“ There are probably more Fergusons out there . They just haven ’ t been sparked by this kind of incident yet , ” said John Brittain , a civil rights lawyer and friend of Attorney General Eric Holder — who on his visit to Ferguson on Wednesday discussed his own history of race-motivated run-ins with the police , saying , “ I understand that mistrust . ”
Obama , who ’ s been more openly and personally tackling racial issues over the last year , acknowledged Monday that the depth of the problems may have been more extensive than many people had considered , calling the “ root causes ” for the tension in Ferguson “ a big project . ”
“ It ’ s one that we ’ ve been trying to carry out now for a couple of centuries . And we ’ ve made extraordinary progress , but we have not made enough progress , ” Obama said .
The White House is very much aware that anything Obama says immediately gets filtered through the polarization of the country , and anything he says on race only more so .
Matthew Hughey , co-author of “ Language , Race and the Republican Party in the Age of Obama , ” is among those who say that Obama ’ s political opponents have trafficked in implicit racial language in attacking him , with all the suspicions about his birth certificate or lines like Newt Gingrich ’ s accusation that Obama has a “ Kenyan , anti-colonial ” mindset feeding on white anxiety .
“ It is the same courting of white reactionary conservative fears , of using coded language , ” Hughey said . “ The 2008 election and the presence of a black first family in the White House allowed people to activate anti-black attitudes in nonracist terms . ”
For Obama , Ferguson and the larger bubbling unrest is a huge potential political problem : He ’ s always been buoyed by strong African-American support , and should that start to slip , he ’ ll be in danger of an overall approval number low enough to usher him into political oblivion — after all , he won 95 percent of the African-American vote in 2008 .
That has remained high , even in the wake of Ferguson , when Obama ’ s public comments have been muted but the White House ’ s behind-the-scenes outreach to black groups has been intense . In a CBS/New York Times poll out Thursday , 60 percent of African-Americans say they approve of Obama ’ s response , while only 35 percent of whites do . That ’ s compared with just a quarter of African-Americans who say they ’ re satisfied with Missouri Gov . Jay Nixon ’ s response . And the criticism of Obama also broke down along party lines : 59 percent of Democrats approved , while 52 percent of Republicans disapproved .
In what Obama has said on Ferguson , he ’ s ended up in a familiar bind : People who feel racial issues haven ’ t been discussed enough expect him , as the first black president , to speak out more forcefully , and they are disappointed when he doesn ’ t , while people who feel that racial issues have been exploited tend to see anything he says on the topic as showing favoritism and overreach .
That ’ s become a factor exacerbating the racial divide , said Andra Gillespie , a former Democratic pollster who now studies black politics at Emory University .
“ We didn ’ t discuss this stuff , but the moment of the African-American president brings what ’ s latent to the forefront , and now it ’ s a question of how we deal with it , ” Gillespie said .
“ That ’ s going to be the big takeaway of the Obama presidency : It takes more than one president to fix problems that are this entrenched and this long-standing . Not that there wasn ’ t progress , not that it wasn ’ t important , but we built up too much of a cult of personality around the president , ” Gillespie said . “ That was a bit naive on all our parts . ”","Obama acknowledged that the depth of problems may be more extensive than many thought.

They just haven’t been sparked by this kind of incident yet,” said John Brittain, a civil rights lawyer and friend of Attorney General Eric Holder — who on his visit to Ferguson on Wednesday discussed his own history of race-motivated run-ins with the police, saying, “I understand that mistrust.”

Obama, who’s been more openly and personally tackling racial issues over the last year, acknowledged Monday that the depth of the problems may have been more extensive than many people had considered, calling the “root causes” for the tension in Ferguson “a big project.”

“It’s one that we’ve been trying to carry out now for a couple of centuries. And we’ve made extraordinary progress, but we have not made enough progress,” Obama said.

The White House is very much aware that anything Obama says immediately gets filtered through the polarization of the country, and anything he says on race only more so.

Matthew Hughey, co-author of “Language, Race and the Republican Party in the Age of Obama,” is among those who say that Obama’s political opponents have trafficked in implicit racial language in attacking him, with all the suspicions about his birth certificate or lines like Newt Gingrich’s accusation that Obama has a “Kenyan, anti-colonial” mindset feeding on white anxiety.

“It is the same courting of white reactionary conservative fears, of using coded language,” Hughey said. “The 2008 election and the presence of a black first family in the White House allowed people to activate anti-black attitudes in nonracist terms.”

For Obama, Ferguson and the larger bubbling unrest is a huge potential political problem: He’s always been buoyed by strong African-American support, and should that start to slip, he’ll be in danger of an overall approval number low enough to usher him into political oblivion — after all, he won 95 percent of the African-American vote in 2008.

That has remained high, even in the wake of Ferguson, when Obama’s public comments have been muted but the White House’s behind-the-scenes outreach to black groups has been intense. In a CBS/New York Times poll out Thursday, 60 percent of African-Americans say they approve of Obama’s response, while only 35 percent of whites do. That’s compared with just a quarter of African-Americans who say they’re satisfied with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s response. And the criticism of Obama also broke down along party lines: 59 percent of Democrats approved, while 52 percent of Republicans disapproved.

In what Obama has said on Ferguson, he’s ended up in a familiar bind: People who feel racial issues haven’t been discussed enough expect him, as the first black president, to speak out more forcefully, and they are disappointed when he doesn’t, while people who feel that racial issues have been exploited tend to see anything he says on the topic as showing favoritism and overreach.

That’s become a factor exacerbating the racial divide, said Andra Gillespie, a former Democratic pollster who now studies black politics at Emory University.

“We didn’t discuss this stuff, but the moment of the African-American president brings what’s latent to the forefront, and now it’s a question of how we deal with it,” Gillespie said.

“That’s going to be the big takeaway of the Obama presidency: It takes more than one president to fix problems that are this entrenched and this long-standing. Not that there wasn’t progress, not that it wasn’t important, but we built up too much of a cult of personality around the president,” Gillespie said. “That was a bit naive on all our parts.”

race_and_racism,National Review,2,http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/417581/fires-last-time-lessons-1968-baltimore-riots-john-fund,The Fires Last Time: Lessons from the 1968 Baltimore Riots ,2015-04-28,"John Fund, John Mccormack, Robert Verbruggen, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Mairead Mcardle, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Michael Brendan Dougherty","Last week , I met with a scholar of the civil-rights movement who was very worried about the first signs of trouble in Baltimore . At one point he looked up at me and suddenly said , “ I ’ m very worried the civil unrest of the 1960s is coming back , and nothing about it will be good . ”
Yesterday ’ s rioting in Baltimore recalls the turmoil that swept that city and 125 others in April 1968 , following the assassination of Martin Luther King . The unrest in Baltimore lasted almost four days and resulted in six people dying , 700 becoming injured , and the destruction of 1,000 businesses . It took over 10,000 National Guard and federal troops to put down the violence . So far , Baltimore ’ s riots aren ’ t nearly of that magnitude .
The 1968 riots had national political significance because of the reaction of then–Maryland governor Spiro Agnew , a moderate Republican who had carried a big chunk of the black vote in winning the election 18 months earlier on the strength of his support for open-housing legislation and school desegregation . He summoned 100 black leaders to his office in Baltimore for a tongue-lashing , “ I did not ask you here to make a bid for peace with the public dollar. ” He proceeded to accuse the leaders of refusing to criticize black militants such as Stokely Carmichael ( who had visited Baltimore three days before the riots ) .
You met in secret with that demagogue and others like him and you agreed , according to published reports that have not been denied , that you would not openly criticize any black spokesman , regardless of his remarks . You were beguiled by the rationalizations of unity ; you were intimidated by veiled threats , you were stung by insinuations you were Mr. Charlie ’ s Boy , by epithets like “ Uncle Tom ” . . . When you who courageously slapped hard at irresponsibility acted , you did more for civil rights than you realize . But when white leaders complemented you for your objective action , you immediately encountered a storm of criticism from the Negro community , parts of the Negro community . The criticism was born of a perverted concept of race loyalty and inflamed by the type of leader who is not here today — and you ran .
Most of the black leaders present walked out before Agnew finished his remarks . Others stayed behind to argue with Agnew about what liberal journalist Jules Witcover called his “ insulting sermon ” but what others called “ speaking truth to enablers . ”
A 2008 documentary on the Baltimore riots by radio station WYPR noted :
Agnew was right about one thing , though . Baltimore ’ s black leaders were agonizingly conflicted about the looting and burning . They knew it was damaging the black community and they tried to stop it . But they sympathized with the anger and despair . ( Morgan State College professor ) Homer Favor remembers a call afterward from his friend Jim Rouse , the developer of Columbia . “ ’ If I showed you a picture of one of your cohorts torching a building , would you believe it ? Would you do anything about it ? ’ ” I didn ’ t know what to say . I respected him . I loved him . So , finally it occurred to me . I said : ‘ Jim , I ’ m sorry you asked me that . Because I feel unclean that I didn ’ t burn down a building. ’ These people were protesting the brutal treatment that we got and I did not participate in it . ”
The riots had profound political implications . Four months later , Agnew became Richard Nixon ’ s vice-presidential running mate . “ Agnew ’ s reading of the riot act to the civil rights leaders who had gone silent in the face of wholesale violence . . . was a major factor in Nixon ’ s choice of him for vice president , ” recalls Nixon aide Pat Buchanan in his recent book on the 1968 campaign . Agnew , of course , later went on to resign in disgrace as vice president in 1973 .
# related # The riots and Agnew ’ s elevation to the vice presidency also ended the political career of Baltimore mayor Tommy D ’ Alessandro , the brother of current House minority leader Nancy Pelosi . “ That was the end of my career , ” D ’ Alessandro later recalled , noting he had planned to run for governor in 1970 but now Agnew would be replaced by the Democratic leader of the state senate , Marvin Mandel . “ If I was going to run now , instead of running against a Republican incumbent , I would have to run against a Democratic incumbent . ”
The WYPR documentary reports that some black leaders also believe the Baltimore riots “ helped trigger the law-and-order backlash of the 70 ’ s and 80 ’ s and a national criminal justice policy that helped put thousands of black men behind bars. ” Some scholars believe the huge investments in welfare and dubious anti-poverty programs ( “ guilt money ” ) that flowed into urban neighborhoods after the riots helped undermine minority family structure and bred increased violence by unruly young men along with a drug culture .

Last week, I met with a scholar of the civil-rights movement who was very worried about the first signs of trouble in Baltimore. At one point he looked up at me and suddenly said, “I’m very worried the civil unrest of the 1960s is coming back, and nothing about it will be good.”

Yesterday’s rioting in Baltimore recalls the turmoil that swept that city and 125 others in April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King. The unrest in Baltimore lasted almost four days and resulted in six people dying, 700 becoming injured, and the destruction of 1,000 businesses. It took over 10,000 National Guard and federal troops to put down the violence. So far, Baltimore’s riots aren’t nearly of that magnitude.

SLIDESHOW: Baltimore Riots

The 1968 riots had national political significance because of the reaction of then–Maryland governor Spiro Agnew, a moderate Republican who had carried a big chunk of the black vote in winning the election 18 months earlier on the strength of his support for open-housing legislation and school desegregation. He summoned 100 black leaders to his office in Baltimore for a tongue-lashing, “I did not ask you here to make a bid for peace with the public dollar.” He proceeded to accuse the leaders of refusing to criticize black militants such as Stokely Carmichael (who had visited Baltimore three days before the riots).

Agnew said:

You met in secret with that demagogue and others like him and you agreed, according to published reports that have not been denied, that you would not openly criticize any black spokesman, regardless of his remarks. You were beguiled by the rationalizations of unity; you were intimidated by veiled threats, you were stung by insinuations you were Mr. Charlie’s Boy, by epithets like “Uncle Tom” . . . When you who courageously slapped hard at irresponsibility acted, you did more for civil rights than you realize. But when white leaders complemented you for your objective action, you immediately encountered a storm of criticism from the Negro community, parts of the Negro community. The criticism was born of a perverted concept of race loyalty and inflamed by the type of leader who is not here today — and you ran.

Most of the black leaders present walked out before Agnew finished his remarks. Others stayed behind to argue with Agnew about what liberal journalist Jules Witcover called his “insulting sermon” but what others called “speaking truth to enablers.”

A 2008 documentary on the Baltimore riots by radio station WYPR noted:

Agnew was right about one thing, though. Baltimore’s black leaders were agonizingly conflicted about the looting and burning. They knew it was damaging the black community and they tried to stop it. But they sympathized with the anger and despair. (Morgan State College professor) Homer Favor remembers a call afterward from his friend Jim Rouse, the developer of Columbia. “’If I showed you a picture of one of your cohorts torching a building, would you believe it? Would you do anything about it?’” I didn’t know what to say. I respected him. I loved him. So, finally it occurred to me. I said: ‘Jim, I’m sorry you asked me that. Because I feel unclean that I didn’t burn down a building.’ These people were protesting the brutal treatment that we got and I did not participate in it.”

The riots had profound political implications. Four months later, Agnew became Richard Nixon’s vice-presidential running mate. “Agnew’s reading of the riot act to the civil rights leaders who had gone silent in the face of wholesale violence . . . was a major factor in Nixon’s choice of him for vice president,” recalls Nixon aide Pat Buchanan in his recent book on the 1968 campaign. Agnew, of course, later went on to resign in disgrace as vice president in 1973.

#related#The riots and Agnew’s elevation to the vice presidency also ended the political career of Baltimore mayor Tommy D’Alessandro, the brother of current House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. “That was the end of my career,” D’Alessandro later recalled, noting he had planned to run for governor in 1970 but now Agnew would be replaced by the Democratic leader of the state senate, Marvin Mandel. “If I was going to run now, instead of running against a Republican incumbent, I would have to run against a Democratic incumbent.”

The WYPR documentary reports that some black leaders also believe the Baltimore riots “helped trigger the law-and-order backlash of the 70’s and 80’s and a national criminal justice policy that helped put thousands of black men behind bars.” Some scholars believe the huge investments in welfare and dubious anti-poverty programs (“guilt money”) that flowed into urban neighborhoods after the riots helped undermine minority family structure and bred increased violence by unruly young men along with a drug culture.

Asian American applicants consistently score higher in the first two criteria -- academics and extra-curricular activities , which can be objectively assessed -- than white students , Latinos and African Americans .
So how does Harvard justify its Asian American quota ? With the help of category three -- '' personal qualities , '' which include vague and largely subjective factors like `` likability , '' `` maturity , '' `` integrity , '' and `` effervescence . ''
According to Harvard 's own internal reports , Asian American applicants are routinely and systematically marked much lower on this personality scale by Harvard admissions officers who almost never meet or interview applicants . But here 's the kicker : the personality ratings given to Asian students by admissions officers are vastly different than the personality ratings Harvard gets from its own alumni interviewers , who actually meet the applicants in person . Alumni interviewers score Asian applicants as high as whites .
In other words , Harvard artificially and fraudulently downgrades Asians on `` personality '' to get the results it wants . And what Harvard wants is to suppress the number of Asian Americans admitted .
Based on the data that Harvard was forced to turn over , economist Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University concluded that with the same application profile in terms of test scores , extracurricular activities and personality factors , an Asian American male applicant would only have a 25 % chance of admission -- versus 32 % if white , 77 % if Hispanic , and 95 % if black .
In 2013 , Asian Americans made up 19 % of the incoming freshmen class . According to Harvard 's own Office of Institutional Research , if the personality factors had not been rigged , that percentage would have been 43 % .
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 guarantees that `` No person in the United States shall , on the ground of race , color or national origin , be excluded from participation in , or be denied benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance . ''
Each year , Harvard takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government .
In Grutter v. Bollinger , the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School 's affirmative action policies , deciding that race could be used as a `` plus factor '' to achieve diversity , but never as a quota . Yet , by placing strict limits on the percentage of Asian American applicants it will admit , racial quotas are exactly what Harvard is using .
One strongly suspects this quota system is n't limited to Harvard . In the last ten years , Asian American students have been limited to an 18-22 % presence across the Ivy League . Or maybe that 's just a coincidence .
Writing for the majority in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court `` expects that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today . ''
With less than a decade to go , the Ivy League shows no indication that it 's giving up on those racial preferences . Instead , these colleges have doubled down . Objective standards regarding admissions continue to be increasingly disfavored as the illegal goal of racial balancing is advanced . This racial balancing is justified by the left 's desire to achieve `` racial diversity '' -- its insistence on seeing every person only through the prism of race , as if the most important thing any of us has to offer is the color of our skin .
Not long ago , that was called `` racism . '' It 's still called racism .
It needs to end , once and for all -- for the sake of deserving Asian American students , for the sake of Harvard 's own integrity , and for the sake of the American principle that the rules must be the same for everyone .
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts said it best : `` The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race . ''
It 's time we did just that . I 'm Lee Cheng , of the Asian American Legal Foundation , for ███ .","Can you imagine, in this day and age, an educational institution discriminating against a racial minority? Can you imagine what the outcry would be?

""You mean, you're preventing these qualified students from attending your college because of the color of their skin?!""

Well, you don't have to imagine it. It's happening. And at arguably the most prestigious college in America--my alma mater, Harvard.

The ethnic minority isn't blacks or Jews, as it was in years past. The target this time is Asian Americans.

And it's just as wrong.

After millions of dollars in legal fees, millions of records examined, and hundreds of hours of depositions and testimony, Harvard's once purposely opaque admissions policies have been laid bare. It's not a pretty picture.

Here's what we now know:

Harvard Admissions rates student applicants in three main ways: 1) Academic performance; 2) Extra-curricular achievements; 3) ""Personal qualities."" That's fine, as far as it goes, if the criteria were applied fairly. But they're not.

Asian American applicants consistently score higher in the first two criteria--academics and extra-curricular activities, which can be objectively assessed--than white students, Latinos and African Americans.

So how does Harvard justify its Asian American quota? With the help of category three--""personal qualities,"" which include vague and largely subjective factors like ""likability,"" ""maturity,"" ""integrity,"" and ""effervescence.""

According to Harvard's own internal reports, Asian American applicants are routinely and systematically marked much lower on this personality scale by Harvard admissions officers who almost never meet or interview applicants. But here's the kicker: the personality ratings given to Asian students by admissions officers are vastly different than the personality ratings Harvard gets from its own alumni interviewers, who actually meet the applicants in person. Alumni interviewers score Asian applicants as high as whites.

In other words, Harvard artificially and fraudulently downgrades Asians on ""personality"" to get the results it wants. And what Harvard wants is to suppress the number of Asian Americans admitted.

Based on the data that Harvard was forced to turn over, economist Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University concluded that with the same application profile in terms of test scores, extracurricular activities and personality factors, an Asian American male applicant would only have a 25% chance of admission--versus 32% if white, 77% if Hispanic, and 95% if black.

What's the real-life result of all this?

In 2013, Asian Americans made up 19% of the incoming freshmen class. According to Harvard's own Office of Institutional Research, if the personality factors had not been rigged, that percentage would have been 43%.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 guarantees that ""No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, or be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.""

Each year, Harvard takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government.

In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policies, deciding that race could be used as a ""plus factor"" to achieve diversity, but never as a quota. Yet, by placing strict limits on the percentage of Asian American applicants it will admit, racial quotas are exactly what Harvard is using.

One strongly suspects this quota system isn't limited to Harvard. In the last ten years, Asian American students have been limited to an 18-22% presence across the Ivy League. Or maybe that's just a coincidence.

Writing for the majority in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court ""expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.""

With less than a decade to go, the Ivy League shows no indication that it's giving up on those racial preferences. Instead, these colleges have doubled down. Objective standards regarding admissions continue to be increasingly disfavored as the illegal goal of racial balancing is advanced. This racial balancing is justified by the left's desire to achieve ""racial diversity""--its insistence on seeing every person only through the prism of race, as if the most important thing any of us has to offer is the color of our skin.

Not long ago, that was called ""racism."" It's still called racism.

It needs to end, once and for all--for the sake of deserving Asian American students, for the sake of Harvard's own integrity, and for the sake of the American principle that the rules must be the same for everyone.

Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts said it best: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""

It's time we did just that. I'm Lee Cheng, of the Asian American Legal Foundation, for Prager University.",www.prageru.com,right,RsqldVPTuyau7Qot

But Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King, chastised Sharpton and fellow civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, noting their long-time history with the president.

""These are his brothers,"" she said. ""At one time in their lives, they highly regarded the president.""

The president's chief of staff says Trump has been reacting in frustration to the Democratic drumbeat of investigation and impeachment talk. But political analysts note that he's once again dominating the news cycle and that may be just what he wants right now.

CBS political director Caitlin Conant said on Faith Nation Monday that she thinks the president is strategically pursuing the conflict. ""It's clearly a fight he wants to have and I think we'll see this bleed into the debate in Detroit this week,"" she said.

Democratic presidential candidates on the debate stage tonight and tomorrow night will have to decide how much time they want to spend going after the president and how much time they want to spend making the case for themselves and their policies.",www1.cbn.com,right,UKvWzFjsNgyooWVI

DETROIT ( AP ) — Joe Biden ’ s presidential campaign spent the past month on the verge of collapse after disappointing finishes in the overwhelmingly white states that launched the Democratic primary .

After a brutal February for Biden , black voters throughout the South transformed Biden ’ s White House bid over the course of three days . A back-of-the-pack operation surged to front-runner status powered by support from black voters , starting with Biden ’ s commanding win Saturday in South Carolina and coming into full focus on Super Tuesday as he racked up wins in Virginia , North Carolina , Alabama and Tennessee .
Biden is now in a tight race with progressive rival Bernie Sanders , who emerged as the initial Democratic leader after strong performances in Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada last month . Activists said Biden ’ s success is a reminder that the path to victory in the Democratic contest runs straight through their communities .
“ You can ’ t win the Democratic presidential nomination without winning the South , and you can ’ t win the South without the black vote , and you can ’ t win the black vote without winning the black women ’ s vote , ” said Melanie Campbell , president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation . “ We believe all roads to the White House must come through the South . ”
Black voters strongly aligned behind Biden over other candidates , according to AP VoteCast surveys across eight Super Tuesday states . In Alabama , where African American voters made up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate , roughly 7 in 10 supported the former vice president . That support held across ages and gender .
In other states , like Texas , Virginia and North Carolina , black voters made up a smaller but sizable share of Democratic primary voters . While a majority of both black men and women supported Biden , Sanders did pull about even with Biden among black voters under 45 .

Since 2016 , Sanders has focused on building relationships with black leaders and voters . He frequently speaks of a multiracial coalition that will help him win the nomination and the White House . But Tuesday ’ s results — combined with his distant second-place finish in South Carolina — suggest he could face similar challenges in 2020 .
Sanders has warned in recent days that the party ’ s elite establishment is aligning to thwart his campaign . But Biden allies pointed to their success with a diverse set of voters on Tuesday to rebut that .
“ I just did not know that African Americans in the South were considered part of the establishment , ” said Louisiana Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond , Biden ’ s campaign co-chairman .

DETROIT (AP) — Joe Biden’s presidential campaign spent the past month on the verge of collapse after disappointing finishes in the overwhelmingly white states that launched the Democratic primary. As he watched the turmoil unfold from Gadsden, Alabama, Robert Avery thought the race would change dramatically when it moved into the South.

“He knows us, he cares about us,” the 71-year-old community organizer said. “People have given us no credit as to knowing what’s going on or being involved, and that’s the furthest thing from the truth.”

It turns out Avery’s instinct was right.

After a brutal February for Biden, black voters throughout the South transformed Biden’s White House bid over the course of three days. A back-of-the-pack operation surged to front-runner status powered by support from black voters, starting with Biden’s commanding win Saturday in South Carolina and coming into full focus on Super Tuesday as he racked up wins in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee.

Biden is now in a tight race with progressive rival Bernie Sanders, who emerged as the initial Democratic leader after strong performances in Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada last month. Activists said Biden’s success is a reminder that the path to victory in the Democratic contest runs straight through their communities.

“You can’t win the Democratic presidential nomination without winning the South, and you can’t win the South without the black vote, and you can’t win the black vote without winning the black women’s vote,” said Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. “We believe all roads to the White House must come through the South.”

race_and_racism,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/29/8513775/baltimore-riots-local-opinions,"In West Baltimore, some residents see rioting as a rational response to daily despair",2015-04-29,Jenée Desmond-Harris,"Baltimore — When a few dozen members of the 300 Men March movement paraded somberly past William Stewart 's West Baltimore stoop Tuesday afternoon , spreading their organization 's message of peace and calm in matching black T-shirts , the 27-year-old rolled his eyes .
He begrudgingly returned their `` Peace , brother '' and `` How y'all doing ? '' greetings . But he does n't really agree with the stance the men who 've dubbed themselves `` Baltimore 's anti-violence movement '' — pleading for a stop to the violence and even physically separating protesters from police — have taken .
It 's not that Stewart is completely for the riots that erupted Monday after the funeral of Freddie Gray , a 25-year-old black man who died on April 19 after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody . But his personal experiences with the police and general hopelessness about the way people like he and Gray — who he says was a neighborhood acquaintance — are treated wo n't let him be too strongly against them , either .
`` Do I condone what they did ? Hell no . Am I okay with it ? Yes , I am . ''
`` At the end of the day I do n't condone them setting stores on fire , '' he said from his perch just blocks from where Gray lived , in the city 's Gilmor Homes ( locals call it `` Gilmor Projects '' ) public housing development , on a dark street with faded multicolored rowhouses . `` But it got the point across . Do I condone what they did ? Hell no . Am I okay with it ? Yes , I am . Because at the end of the day , you mean to tell me it takes 3,000 people to go all around one town for the mayor and the president to say something about what goes on in Baltimore ? It should have been happening for years . ''
Stewart is one of the everyday people in West Baltimore who are invisible in the narrative that tends to pit the young people Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake called `` thugs '' and Obama called `` criminals '' against the ministers and civil rights leaders who 've made desperate pleas at press conferences for `` positive change '' and `` working together . '' Stewart and others like him see the story of Gray 's death and the possibility that the officers will go unpunished as utterly predictable . They may not have participated in or celebrated the violence — the looting , the setting fires , the destruction of local businesses — but they 're acutely aware that these things are exactly what forced a flood of national news outlets to show up where they live . Their real despair over the all-too-familiar topic of police misconduct means that the riots , to them , were understandable . And even , in some ways , right .
`` Y'all mad at the police ! I know ! I get it ! '' a middle-aged woman with a scarf wrapped around her dreadlocks shouted into the mic at a West Baltimore block party when it was her speak from atop a box that served as a makeshift stage . In fact , just about everyone gets it : among black people in West Baltimore , there 's simply no question about whether grievances with the police are legitimate .
This problem is well documented . The Baltimore Sun reported last September that the city has shelled out more than $ 5 million in the past four years in lawsuits accusing police officers of assaulting citizens — most of whom were African-American and almost all of whom were ultimately cleared of criminal charges . The article chronicles outrageous brutality against victims including a 15-year-old boy , a pregnant woman , and a 65-year-old church deacon .
`` Rough rides '' — when police vans are driven recklessly , sometimes seriously injuring passengers who are handcuffed and not wearing seat belts — are common enough that the Sun reported police have multiple alternative nicknames for the practice , including `` screen test '' and `` bringing them up front . ''
In response to the Sun 's investigation into brutality lawsuits , Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez , who leads the department 's Professional Standards and Accountability Bureau , told the paper that officers are mandated to police in a manner that does n't violate constitutional rights . `` We will not let officers get away with any wrongdoing , '' Rodriguez told the Sun in 2014 . `` It will not be tolerated . ''
The people who are living it , though , do n't talk about `` wrongdoing . '' They do n't talk about `` police misconduct , '' or use phrases like `` a few bad policemen '' or `` racially biased policing '' that you hear in media accounts of what 's become a regular national story since Michael Brown was killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson , Missouri , last August . When they complain , they usually just say `` the police '' — suggesting that in their minds , lawless , cruel treatment is not a recent plague or a problem with a few bad apples , but rather a permanent characteristic of the entire department 's identity .
A 45-year-old woman hovering half behind the screen door of a rowhouse just across from the Gilmor Homes , who did n't want to give her last name , shot nervous glances at her 23-year-old son , who sat visiting a friend in front of the house two doors down . `` I worry about him every day , about something happening to him . [ Freddie Gray ] could have been mine . It could have been anyone 's child , '' she said , adding , `` I 'm as worried about something happening to him with the police as I am about anyone else . It does n't matter who you are . They think we 're all the same. ``
Stewart , who remembered Gray as a `` nice kid '' and a `` totally regular guy who never hurt anyone '' said he himself could have easily been the one with the deadly spinal cord injury after an encounter with officers . `` That 's how they treat us , '' he said . `` They 'll beat the shit out of you and lock you up . I 've been arrested unjustly plenty of times . ''
His neighbor , a 27-year-old named Melvin who only wanted to give his first name , called the Baltimore City Police Department `` the biggest gang out here . ''
He ticked off their tactics rather casually : `` They 've slapped my face for nothing ... they take us to other districts , just to get us beat up . They 'll drop you somewhere far from where you live and leave you ; they 'll take the battery out of your phone ... We 're talking years and years of this shit . People 's fed up with it . ''
The consensus that this experience is so commonplace — that being antagonized by the police without any remedy is simply part of life for black people in certain parts of Baltimore — is jarring . `` I have n't met a young person in their teenage years who has n't been harassed , '' said Noche Dias , a 26-year-old youth organizer from New York City who traveled to Baltimore after Gray 's death . `` I 've talked to mothers who have told me their sons were killed by police , and everyone says they 've been treated like a criminal . Everyone . ''
Baltimore 's mostly young protestors who were blamed for multiple police injuries and looting Monday night — police were also caught on video throwing rocks back at them — have been dismissed as everything from wholly irrational to purely criminal .
By the end of the night , police said 20 officers were injured and over two dozen people were arrested . A CVS drugstore and a senior center had been destroyed by fire . The National Guard was called in , a state of emergency was declared in the city , Baltimore public schools were closed , and a weeklong curfew was put in place .
An earlier statement by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake appeared to have been ignored . `` It is idiotic to think that by destroying your city , you 're going to make life better for anybody , '' she 'd said Saturday , as the protests first became violent . `` Too many people have spent generations building up this city for it to be destroyed by thugs who , in a very senseless way , are trying to tear down what so many have fought for . ''
At a press conference Tuesday , Obama echoed these sentiments , saying rioters should be `` treated as criminals '' and accusing them not only distracting from `` multiple days of peaceful protests that were focused on entirely legitimate concerns , '' but of being wholly counterproductive . `` They 're destroying and undermining opportunities and businesses in their own communities , '' he said .
But according to Mark D. Smaller , the president of the American Psychoanalytic Association , the psychology of rioting means it should n't be written off quite so easily as pointless destruction . `` These groups can become the vehicle for expressing anger , rage and helplessness , '' he said in an email to ███ . `` One must keep in mind that this behavior is not simply random , but a group or community 's way of communicating their frustration at chronically not being listened to , responded to , and finally marginalized . ''
Raphael Blake , 40 , who was walking somberly alone through Tuesday 's block party , sees riots as more than random . That 's why , he said , while the violence saddens him , the protesters have good reason to be skeptical of the refrain of political and religious leaders — and people like the members of the 300 Men March group — that the youth must calm down and look for peaceful solutions .
`` You want to ‘ sit down and compromise and talk , ' but about what ? These mayors , these preachers , they 're trying to sugarcoat it , but the youth do n't want to hear that shit , 'cause they 're rubbing elbows with the oppressors . The kids might not understand the policy and politics exactly , but they understand what 's happening to them . They might as well shut down the system , '' he said with a shrug . `` They 're already set up . ''
Stewart said his personal experience — and his disappointment with the recommended peaceful approach — wo n't allow him to criticize those who took the response to Gray 's death in a more destructive direction . `` I was one of the ones who started the peaceful protests ... the first seven days [ after Gray 's death ] , when it was fine and dandy . I walked about 101 miles in peace . But if you protest peacefully , they do n't give a shit , '' he said .
Some even see the riots as rational . According to Heather Gautney , associate professor in Fordham University 's department of sociology and author of Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era , this analysis makes some sense . `` Critics of the rioters claim there are alternative , more rational means of making social change and realizing justice , but what are these means ? '' she asked . `` The rioters in Baltimore and elsewhere know that the chances of making change within the system are few — that the system has turned against them — so they react with rage , a sense of abandon and revenge , and desire to tear it down and start anew . ''
`` Why would you destroy your own neighborhood ? '' is a question that rang out on cable news as cameras recorded protesters destroying parts of Ferguson last summer , and again as buildings burned in Baltimore Monday . The implication is that the destruction and violence is a meaningless , illogical response — hurting one 's own neighborhood to protest the actions of outsiders . But Gautney said it 's wrong to paint all riots as irrational outbursts . `` Riots like the ones we are seeing in Baltimore , and before that in Los Angeles in 1992 , should be viewed as rational responses to injustice , '' she said . `` Riots highlight the injustice and violence that 's prevalent in impoverished neighborhoods in this country . ''
`` The CVS ? They got insurance , they can rebuild . Freddie Gray had insurance , but it 's not gon na bring back his life . ''
And Stewart — as someone who lives in one of those neighborhoods — can see how that could make the destruction ultimately worth it . `` The CVS ? They got insurance , they can rebuild . Freddie Gray had insurance , but it 's not gon na bring back his life . ''
The potential to highlight injustice is why Paul , a 50-year-old born and raised in Baltimore who initially dismissed this week 's looting with a resigned , `` It 's teenagers . What are you gon na do ? '' said that when he saw the destruction to his community , it did n't particularly hurt him . `` It was coming , '' he said . `` They probably think this is gon na end up in the history books because they caused this ruckus . And you know what ? They may be right .

Everyone understands police violence and misconduct

""The rioters in Baltimore and elsewhere know that the chances of making change within the system are few — that the system has turned against them — so they react with rage, a sense of abandon and revenge, and desire to tear it down and start anew.""

""Why would you destroy your own neighborhood?"" is a question that rang out on cable news as cameras recorded protesters destroying parts of Ferguson last summer, and again as buildings burned in Baltimore Monday. The implication is that the destruction and violence is a meaningless, illogical response — hurting one's own neighborhood to protest the actions of outsiders. But Gautney said it's wrong to paint all riots as irrational outbursts. ""Riots like the ones we are seeing in Baltimore, and before that in Los Angeles in 1992, should be viewed as rational responses to injustice,"" she said. ""Riots highlight the injustice and violence that's prevalent in impoverished neighborhoods in this country.""

""The CVS? They got insurance, they can rebuild. Freddie Gray had insurance, but it's not gonna bring back his life.""

And Stewart — as someone who lives in one of those neighborhoods — can see how that could make the destruction ultimately worth it. ""The CVS? They got insurance, they can rebuild. Freddie Gray had insurance, but it's not gonna bring back his life.""

The potential to highlight injustice is why Paul, a 50-year-old born and raised in Baltimore who initially dismissed this week's looting with a resigned, ""It's teenagers. What are you gonna do?"" said that when he saw the destruction to his community, it didn't particularly hurt him. ""It was coming,"" he said. ""They probably think this is gonna end up in the history books because they caused this ruckus. And you know what? They may be right.""",www.vox.com,left,1cBgsA2PMOV0Sopa

With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color , President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life .
He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics — the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants .
Although three of the four women were born in the United States , the president said they should all `` go back '' where they came from . That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves of newcomers have been targeted by individuals , groups and even whole political parties .
At times , the motivations have been economic , focusing on competition for jobs and such social goods as housing or welfare programs . But there has also been a recurrent theme of cultural differences – an emphasis on characteristics of religion or language that identify new arrivals as `` the other . ''
Anti-immigration sentiments emerged in force starting in the 1830s , when U.S. citizens descended primarily from English and Scottish settlers bridled at the influx of Irish . Most of the arriving Irish were Catholic , prompting a hostile reaction among some Protestants that led to deadly riots in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts . The persistence of such prejudice made `` No Irish Need Apply '' one of the most iconic signs in the national memory .
After the Irish , the hostile reaction extended to a surge of new arrivals in the 1840s from Germany , again largely Catholic . In ethnic terms , the Irish and Germans were akin to other colonial Americans ( and to immigrants arriving from Scandinavia ) . But they were viewed as different , clannish and hard to assimilate . They were seen as not just competing for jobs but as threatening the social , cultural and political order .
They were pilloried as susceptible to criminality and drunkenness and seen as loyal to the foreign power of the pope in Rome .
In the 1840s and 1850s , political parties formed in the U.S. to oppose the permissive immigration policies of the time . Some of these parties embraced the term `` Native American , '' spawning the label `` nativist '' that has stuck to succeeding generations of immigration opponents .
Perhaps the best known of these was the American Party , which began as a semi-secret society ( `` The Order of the Star Spangled Banner '' ) , with members being told to deny any knowledge of it .
When they claimed to `` know nothing '' of the group , they were pilloried as the `` Know Nothing '' party – a name that would long survive the entity itself . The party railed against the new arrivals as an economic , social and cultural threat that was bringing crime , disease , social unrest and the prospect of political takeover at the local level .
The Know Nothings had attracted scores of members of the U.S. Congress at the height of their influence in the mid-1850s , stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of the Whigs .
In 1856 , they nominated Millard Fillmore , a former president and former Whig , as their national candidate . Fillmore got 21 % of the popular vote but only a handful of Electoral College votes , as many of the Know Nothings crossed over to vote for John Fremont , the first nominee of the fledgling Republican Party .
The 1860s brought the Civil War and a desperate need for soldiers , leading to greater acceptance of new arrivals who were willing to join the Union Army . In the years that followed , some immigrants found acceptance as veterans , others made their way west to farm the interior or work in its burgeoning cities .
The Know Nothings were not an organized force again after the Civil War , but resistance to immigration never left the national conversation . The importation of Asians to work on the Western railroads and harvests introduced another enduring chapter of American nativism . The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on nation of origin . Some of the jobs denied to Chinese workers were soon filled by Mexicans .
Toward the end of the 1800s , the flow of immigrants from Europe swelled again and changed in its origin . The new arrivals now hailed from Eastern and Southern Europe , as well as from countries that had been sending opportunity seekers across the Atlantic for generations .
The proportion of U.S. residents who were foreign-born hit 13.5 % in the census report of 1911 , the highest it had ever been and a level not reached again until the present decade .
When the World War I ended , anti-immigration sentiment reached a new level of intensity as it swept much of the country , helping to fuel a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan among other extremist groups .
An old association of immigration and urbanization was renewed when the census of 1920 showed immigrants had helped shift the center of U.S. population from rural areas to cities and big towns . Congress , dominated by members from rural , traditional parts of the country , simply refused to reapportion its seats and redraw election districts to reflect the new numbers .
That refusal lasted through four biennial election cycles , during which time Congress also passed an emergency ceiling on annual immigration levels and then lowered that by half again in the Immigration Act of 1924 . That law set quotas by country of origin and explicitly preferred Northern Europeans over all others .
The official attitude in the 1920s and 1930s included an ambivalence toward refugees from conflicts around the world . In 1939 , a German ship called the St. Louis tried to make port in Florida with more than 900 passengers , most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany .
U.S. officials in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt refused to let them land . They tried to persuade Cuba to take them , but without success . The ship returned to Europe , where many of the passengers were later arrested . Researchers believe that more than 250 perished in the Holocaust .
A generation later , in 1965 , Congress passed a more liberal immigration law that eliminated quotas based on nation of origin . The law sought to reunite families and level the playing field for prospective immigrants around the world – and its impact went far beyond what its sponsors might have imagined .
The proportion of foreign-born in the U.S. population rose again from just 5 % in 1965 to 14 % over the next half century . And these new waves of arrivals would be far more diverse than their predecessors were . They came not only from different parts of Europe but from Asia , Africa and South America as well .
By the 1970s , the political focal point was the effect the law was having on the Southwest and the influx of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking populations . Pressure for changing the law grew as latter-day nativists again saw the new arrivals as a social , cultural and political challenge .
Many of the same arguments made against previous generations of newcomers were lodged again against Hispanics , including that they would cling to their national culture and language and refuse to assimilate .
Labor groups also sought to control the competition from workers willing to take lower wages . But there were powerful business interests , particularly from the agricultural sector , determined to preserve access to migrant workers .

race_and_racism,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/3/21206760/andrew-yang-washington-post-asian-americans-opinion,Andrew Yang told Asian Americans to prove their Americanness. Here’s why that’s wrong.,2020-04-03,Li Zhou,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made a stunning argument in a Washington Post op-ed this week : To combat the recent surge in hate crimes and racism amid the coronavirus pandemic , he suggested , Asian Americans should showcase just how American they are through acts of patriotism and community .
Effectively , he wrote , Asians can help end racism by being the best citizens we can be :
We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before . We need to step up , help our neighbors , donate gear , vote , wear red white and blue , volunteer , fund aid organizations , and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis . We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need .
Yang , who came to this conclusion after an unsettling experience of his own , appears to believe that contributing civically in a visible way is the best approach to respond to acts of prejudice .
While it ’ s entirely fair for him to want to confront such biases in his own way , the application of his reasoning is where things get concerning . There ’ s certainly a worthwhile case to be made that everyone , regardless of their background , should be stepping up and helping their communities during this devastating crisis . But Yang ’ s point is specifically aimed at Asian Americans .
In fact , he suggests that Asian Americans , as a group , need to demonstrate that they are positive contributors to society just to be treated as equals . It ’ s a deeply flawed argument that puts the onus on Asian Americans to make themselves more palatable to those who would discriminate against them . And it ’ s also among the latest to advance a misguided theory of “ respectability politics . ”

In one citation in his op-ed , Yang notes that Japanese Americans joined the military at high rates during World War II to demonstrate their allegiance to the United States .

While Trump has since said that the Asian American community should be protected , it ’ s a statement he made without even acknowledging his own comments and role in promoting racism .

This week , several House members — including Reps. Judy Chu and Hakeem Jeffries — were among those who vocalized such positions . Similarly , Sens .

It ’ s disheartening , however , to see this dynamic acknowledged as the default assumption by an Asian American leader himself .
There ’ s nothing to be gained in denying the reality that Asian Americans , many immigrant groups , and people of color are still treated differently by those who hold biases or find it advantageous to inflame existing disparities .
But explicitly telling Asian Americans that we need to justify our Americanness reinforces such frames instead of rejecting them completely .","Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made a stunning argument in a Washington Post op-ed this week: To combat the recent surge in hate crimes and racism amid the coronavirus pandemic, he suggested, Asian Americans should showcase just how American they are through acts of patriotism and community.

Effectively, he wrote, Asians can help end racism by being the best citizens we can be:

We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.

Yang, who came to this conclusion after an unsettling experience of his own, appears to believe that contributing civically in a visible way is the best approach to respond to acts of prejudice.

While it’s entirely fair for him to want to confront such biases in his own way, the application of his reasoning is where things get concerning. There’s certainly a worthwhile case to be made that everyone, regardless of their background, should be stepping up and helping their communities during this devastating crisis. But Yang’s point is specifically aimed at Asian Americans.

In fact, he suggests that Asian Americans, as a group, need to demonstrate that they are positive contributors to society just to be treated as equals. It’s a deeply flawed argument that puts the onus on Asian Americans to make themselves more palatable to those who would discriminate against them. And it’s also among the latest to advance a misguided theory of “respectability politics.”

As Damon Young explained in the Root, “respectability politics” is an idea that picked up momentum in the 1990s and has been used to urge black Americans to dress or behave in a certain way as a means to neutralize racism. “It’s generally defined as what happens when minority and/or marginalized groups are told (or teach themselves) that in order to receive better treatment from the group in power, they must behave better,” Young writes.

Definitions vary in red and blue America.,2019-07-18,"Peter Grier, Story Hinckley, Noah Robertson","“ People bring their own meaning to ... the word , ” says Jennifer Mercieca , a historian of American political discourse . “ Racism is difficult to pin down . ”
There are two very different working definitions of racism in the U.S. – the red state definition and the blue state definition . Minorities and Democrats living in blue states have a broader and more comprehensive view of what constitutes racist behavior than many Republicans living in red states perhaps understand or accept . The 2020 campaign could produce an uncomfortable national reckoning with this disparity .
Massachusetts voter William Watkins disagrees . “ He ’ s saying to his base , it ’ s them . They ’ re the problem , ” says Mr. Watkins , who is represented in Congress by Ayanna Pressley , one of the lawmakers targeted by Mr. Trump ’ s tweets .
“ Racism is when you believe one race is better than another , and that ’ s not what he said at all , ” she says .
Dee Bragg does not think President Donald Trump is racist . Waiting in a sweltering parking lot before the president ’ s rally in Greenville , North Carolina , on Wednesday , the proud Trump supporter notes that his tweet telling four Democratic congresswomen of color to “ go back ” to the “ places from which they came ” never mentioned race .
Hours before President Donald Trump held a rally in Greenville , North Carolina , on Wednesday night , nobody waiting in the heat and anticipation of the parking lot outside an East Carolina University auditorium said he was a racist . Nobody asked by a reporter thought his tweet telling four female members of Congress to “ go back ” to the “ places from which they came ” was racist at all .
The tweet was vague and didn ’ t refer directly to race , many said . Besides , “ racist ” is thrown around too much , in their view . Democrats use it at the drop of a MAGA hat .
“ They use that word for everything now , ” said rally attendee Johnny Liles of Emerald Isle , North Carolina .
Voters in Massachusetts ’ 7th Congressional District had a very different view .
The 7th is represented by Ayanna Pressley , one of the congresswomen Mr. Trump referred to , and almost all of her constituents interviewed thought the tweet was racist – self-evidently so .
Many asked how anybody could doubt that “ they ” referred to black and brown people . The “ go back ” trope , long used against non-whites in America , was all the more offensive because all the women were citizens , and three were born in the U.S .
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission – a federal agency – uses “ go back to where you came from ” as an example of an ethnic slur , said Haris Hardaway , the owner of a boutique in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston .
During the Jim Crow era , those words were “ used to invalidate our humanity and our citizenship of this country , ” Mr. Hardaway said . ” And that ’ s why I see them as racist . ”
As this comparison shows , there are two very different working definitions of racism in the U.S. – the red state definition , and the blue state definition .
It ’ s no longer the 1960s . Most Americans would likely agree that it is racist to stand in a schoolhouse door , as then-Gov . George Wallace of Alabama did in 1963 , to try to forcibly prevent the integration of the University of Alabama .
But minorities and Democrats living in blue states today have a broader and more comprehensive view of what constitutes racist behavior than many Republicans living in red states perhaps understand or accept . The 2020 campaign could produce an uncomfortable national reckoning with this disparity – particularly if Trump rallies continue to feature chants of “ Send her back ! ” as the crowd roared in Greenville Wednesday night . For his part , Mr. Trump disavowed the chant Thursday , saying , “ I disagree with it . ”
“ Go back to the civil rights marches in the ’ 50s and ’ 60s , and a lot of white communities did not quite understand what racism was . So this is not new . It is more modern day racism with a suit and tie , ” says retiree Danny Hardaway , Haris ’ s father .
Mr. Trump ’ s “ go back ” tweet and his subsequent comments were aimed at Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts , and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota . All are women of color ; all except Representative Omar were born in the U.S. ( She is a naturalized citizen who came to America as a Somali refugee . )
J. Scott Applewhite/AP Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn ( second from left ) speaks as fellow Democratic congresswomen Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts , and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York listen during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington . President Donald Trump ignited a firestorm with a tweet aimed at them .
The “ go back ” phrase ’ s long use to portray foreigners and non-white ethnic groups as not deserving of a place in America forced the news media to grapple with its descriptive terms in the wake of Mr. Trump ’ s eruption . Many flatly called it “ racist. ” Others attributed that designation to others , or used “ racially tinged ” or other euphemistic phrases .
Still others thought that description went too far . Fox News senior analyst Brit Hume thought Mr. Trump ’ s statements were nativist , ignorant , bad , and bad politics – but not racist . It didn ’ t meet the first definition of “ racism ” in the Merriam-Webster dictionary , he said : “ a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race . ”
Many Trump rally attendees offered variations of this position in explaining why they didn ’ t think his tweet was racist . It wasn ’ t really derogatory , they said . It did not refer to blacks or Muslims or Hispanics directly , and did not even refer to the targets by name .
Story Hinckley/The ███ Kimberly Beyer ( left ) and her daughter Amanda Keating waiting in line for President Donald Trump ’ s rally in Greenville , North Carolina , Wednesday . “ I think it was an ignorant statement – like why would you tell citizens to ‘ go back ’ – but I don ’ t think it was racist , ” said Ms. Keating , a schoolteacher , referring to a tweet by Mr. Trump . “ Now , if anyone doesn ’ t like what you say , you ’ re a racist . ''
“ Racism is when you believe one race is better than another , and that ’ s not what he said at all , ” said Dee Bragg , from Nags Head , North Carolina .
Others bring a different experience and heritage to the same words , and thus hear something different .
“ People bring their own meaning to what the word is . ‘ Racism ’ is difficult to pin down , ” said Jennifer Mercieca , a historian of U.S. political discourse with a forthcoming book on President Trump ’ s rhetoric .
Dr. Mercieca , for instance , disagrees with Mr. Hume , and believes that Mr. Trump ’ s statement does meet the standard definition of racism . Given the history of the phrase , what else would it be referring to , other than a minority whose position in America is thought tenuous ? Without using specifics , it calls into question their place in the nation . Would anyone think to insult a white person by telling them to “ go back to where you came from ? ”
The South enacted poll taxes , voter registration tests , and other pre-Civil Rights era restrictions on black voting rights without mentioning “ black ” in the laws . Were those racist ?
“ He ’ s saying to his base it ’ s them . They ’ re the problem . How could they tell us what to do ? How could they come to our country and tell us what to do ? But all ... these women are Americans , ” says William Watkins , a 7th district voter and director of workforce development at the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts .
A USA Today-Ipsos poll released Wednesday found that 65 % of Americans aware of Mr. Trump ’ s “ go back ” statement agreed that it was racist .
But as is often the case in American politics today , that opinion broke sharply along partisan lines , with many Republicans saying it was not racist . And fully 70 % of GOP respondents to the survey agreed with the statement “ people who call others ‘ racist ’ usually do so in bad faith . ”
That was another primary argument used by Trump supporters as to why they did not believe racism described his actions . Democrats and others don ’ t really mean it when they cry “ racist , ” they said . It ’ s just an all-purpose insult , an evocative one , used by his enemies .
“ They are just so flippant with it , ” said Al Byrum of Nags Head outside the President Trump rally venue .
The more it ’ s used , the more it loses its meaning , some Republicans say . Fox News talk show host Greg Gutfeld on Tuesday mocked CNN and MSNBC for a report that they used the word “ racist ” or variations 1,100 times in two days following President Trump ’ s tweet . National Review senior editor Jay Nordlinger – no fan of Mr. Trump or the “ go back ” language – himself tweeted that as a Reagan conservative he ’ d been called a racist so often the charge now rings hollow .
Those who feel the sting of being called racist experience it as an insult . If it ’ s used over and over , the power of that sting may lessen .
But those who use it see “ racist ” as both insult and description . It ’ s like calling something “ blue , ” to many Democrats and minorities . If you call 1,100 things blue , the 1,101st object is still blue . It hasn ’ t turned green due to “ blue ” overuse .
But the identification of something as racist can be more subjective than simply noting its color . For instance , was Nike right to recently pull from the market sneakers depicting the 13-star banner known as the Betsy Ross flag , after former football star Colin Kaepernick objected that the flag dates to the era of 18th -century slavery and has occasionally been flown by far-right groups ?
That move received plenty of pushback from Republicans and some Democrats as well .

“ In liberalism it ’ s like everything ’ s about racism and it ’ s driving me crazy , ” said Denis Rouleau , a Cambridge , Massachusetts , resident and supporter of President Trump . “ If you don ’ t agree with liberals you ’ re a racist . That ’ s how it seems to me . ”

It was written by Peter Grier .","“People bring their own meaning to ... the word,” says Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political discourse. “Racism is difficult to pin down.”

Hours before President Donald Trump held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday night, nobody waiting in the heat and anticipation of the parking lot outside an East Carolina University auditorium said he was a racist. Nobody asked by a reporter thought his tweet telling four female members of Congress to “go back” to the “places from which they came” was racist at all.

The tweet was vague and didn’t refer directly to race, many said. Besides, “racist” is thrown around too much, in their view. Democrats use it at the drop of a MAGA hat.

“They use that word for everything now,” said rally attendee Johnny Liles of Emerald Isle, North Carolina.

Voters in Massachusetts’ 7th Congressional District had a very different view.

The 7th is represented by Ayanna Pressley, one of the congresswomen Mr. Trump referred to, and almost all of her constituents interviewed thought the tweet was racist – self-evidently so.

Many asked how anybody could doubt that “they” referred to black and brown people. The “go back” trope, long used against non-whites in America, was all the more offensive because all the women were citizens, and three were born in the U.S.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission – a federal agency – uses “go back to where you came from” as an example of an ethnic slur, said Haris Hardaway, the owner of a boutique in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.

During the Jim Crow era, those words were “used to invalidate our humanity and our citizenship of this country,” Mr. Hardaway said. ”And that’s why I see them as racist.”

As this comparison shows, there are two very different working definitions of racism in the U.S. – the red state definition, and the blue state definition.

It’s no longer the 1960s. Most Americans would likely agree that it is racist to stand in a schoolhouse door, as then-Gov. George Wallace of Alabama did in 1963, to try to forcibly prevent the integration of the University of Alabama.

But minorities and Democrats living in blue states today have a broader and more comprehensive view of what constitutes racist behavior than many Republicans living in red states perhaps understand or accept. The 2020 campaign could produce an uncomfortable national reckoning with this disparity – particularly if Trump rallies continue to feature chants of “Send her back!” as the crowd roared in Greenville Wednesday night. For his part, Mr. Trump disavowed the chant Thursday, saying, “I disagree with it.”

“Go back to the civil rights marches in the ’50s and ’60s, and a lot of white communities did not quite understand what racism was. So this is not new. It is more modern day racism with a suit and tie,” says retiree Danny Hardaway, Haris’s father.

“Go back”: a long-used phrase

Mr. Trump’s “go back” tweet and his subsequent comments were aimed at Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. All are women of color; all except Representative Omar were born in the U.S. (She is a naturalized citizen who came to America as a Somali refugee.)

J. Scott Applewhite/AP Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn (second from left) speaks as fellow Democratic congresswomen Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York listen during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington. President Donald Trump ignited a firestorm with a tweet aimed at them.

The “go back” phrase’s long use to portray foreigners and non-white ethnic groups as not deserving of a place in America forced the news media to grapple with its descriptive terms in the wake of Mr. Trump’s eruption. Many flatly called it “racist.” Others attributed that designation to others, or used “racially tinged” or other euphemistic phrases.

Still others thought that description went too far. Fox News senior analyst Brit Hume thought Mr. Trump’s statements were nativist, ignorant, bad, and bad politics – but not racist. It didn’t meet the first definition of “racism” in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, he said: “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.”

Many Trump rally attendees offered variations of this position in explaining why they didn’t think his tweet was racist. It wasn’t really derogatory, they said. It did not refer to blacks or Muslims or Hispanics directly, and did not even refer to the targets by name.

Story Hinckley/The Christian Science Monitor Kimberly Beyer (left) and her daughter Amanda Keating waiting in line for President Donald Trump’s rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Wednesday. “I think it was an ignorant statement – like why would you tell citizens to ‘go back’ – but I don’t think it was racist,” said Ms. Keating, a schoolteacher, referring to a tweet by Mr. Trump. “Now, if anyone doesn’t like what you say, you’re a racist.""

“Racism is when you believe one race is better than another, and that’s not what he said at all,” said Dee Bragg, from Nags Head, North Carolina.

Others bring a different experience and heritage to the same words, and thus hear something different.

“People bring their own meaning to what the word is. ‘Racism’ is difficult to pin down,” said Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of U.S. political discourse with a forthcoming book on President Trump’s rhetoric.

Dr. Mercieca, for instance, disagrees with Mr. Hume, and believes that Mr. Trump’s statement does meet the standard definition of racism. Given the history of the phrase, what else would it be referring to, other than a minority whose position in America is thought tenuous? Without using specifics, it calls into question their place in the nation. Would anyone think to insult a white person by telling them to “go back to where you came from?”

The South enacted poll taxes, voter registration tests, and other pre-Civil Rights era restrictions on black voting rights without mentioning “black” in the laws. Were those racist?

“He’s saying to his base it’s them. They’re the problem. How could they tell us what to do? How could they come to our country and tell us what to do? But all ... these women are Americans,” says William Watkins, a 7th district voter and director of workforce development at the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts.

Polling shows a sharp divide

A USA Today-Ipsos poll released Wednesday found that 65% of Americans aware of Mr. Trump’s “go back” statement agreed that it was racist.

But as is often the case in American politics today, that opinion broke sharply along partisan lines, with many Republicans saying it was not racist. And fully 70% of GOP respondents to the survey agreed with the statement “people who call others ‘racist’ usually do so in bad faith.”

That was another primary argument used by Trump supporters as to why they did not believe racism described his actions. Democrats and others don’t really mean it when they cry “racist,” they said. It’s just an all-purpose insult, an evocative one, used by his enemies.

“They are just so flippant with it,” said Al Byrum of Nags Head outside the President Trump rally venue.

The more it’s used, the more it loses its meaning, some Republicans say. Fox News talk show host Greg Gutfeld on Tuesday mocked CNN and MSNBC for a report that they used the word “racist” or variations 1,100 times in two days following President Trump’s tweet. National Review senior editor Jay Nordlinger – no fan of Mr. Trump or the “go back” language – himself tweeted that as a Reagan conservative he’d been called a racist so often the charge now rings hollow.

“Good job, wolf-criers,” he tweeted.

Those who feel the sting of being called racist experience it as an insult. If it’s used over and over, the power of that sting may lessen.

But those who use it see “racist” as both insult and description. It’s like calling something “blue,” to many Democrats and minorities. If you call 1,100 things blue, the 1,101st object is still blue. It hasn’t turned green due to “blue” overuse.

But the identification of something as racist can be more subjective than simply noting its color. For instance, was Nike right to recently pull from the market sneakers depicting the 13-star banner known as the Betsy Ross flag, after former football star Colin Kaepernick objected that the flag dates to the era of 18th -century slavery and has occasionally been flown by far-right groups?

That move received plenty of pushback from Republicans and some Democrats as well.

“In liberalism it’s like everything’s about racism and it’s driving me crazy,” said Denis Rouleau, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, resident and supporter of President Trump. “If you don’t agree with liberals you’re a racist. That’s how it seems to me.”

But the law—in that comfortable cradle of great virtue the world knows as Charlottesville, Va.,—has prevailed.

And it’s the celebration of racist business as usual.



On Wednesday, a judge in the fair , ahem, city ruled the controversial statues o f Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Stonewall Jackson must stay where they are.

This is a slap in the face to the February 2017 vote by the Charlottesville City Council to remove the statue of Lee, which sparked the shameful “Unite the Right” white nationalist rally that left counter-protestor, Heather Heyer, dead and 28 people injured when a white supremacist plowed into them with his 2010 Dodge Challenger.

According to WTOP, Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore ruled the memorials cannot and will not be touched.

In the last century , there have been hundreds of uprisings in black communities in response to white violence . Some have produced substantive change . After the assassination of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 , uprisings in more than 100 cities broke the final congressional deadlock over whether it should be illegal to deny people housing simply because they descended from people who had been enslaved . The Fair Housing Act , which prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race , gender and religion , among other categories , seemed destined to die in Congress as white Southerners were joined by many of their Northern counterparts who knew housing segregation was central to how Jim Crow was accomplished in the North . But just seven days after King ’ s death , President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law from the smoldering capital , which was still under protection from the National Guard .
Most of the time these uprisings have produced hand-wringing and consternation but few necessary structural changes . After black uprisings swept the nation in the mid-1960s , Johnson created the Kerner Commission to examine their causes , and the report it issued in 1968 recommended a national effort to dismantle segregation and structural racism across American institutions . It was shelved by the president , like so many similar reports , and instead white Americans voted in a “ law and order ” president , Richard Nixon . The following decades brought increased police militarization , law-enforcement spending and mass incarceration of black Americans .

The changes we ’ re seeing today in some ways seem shockingly swift , and in other ways rage-inducingly slow . After years of black-led activism , protest and organizing , the weeks of protests since George Floyd ’ s killing have moved lawmakers to ban chokeholds by police officers , consider stripping law enforcement of the qualified immunity that has made it almost impossible to hold responsible officers who kill , and discuss moving significant parts of ballooning police budgets into funding for social services . Black Lives Matter , the group founded in 2013 by three black women , Patrisse Khan-Cullors , Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi , after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin ’ s killer , saw its support among American voters rise almost as much in the two weeks after Floyd ’ s killing than in the last two years . According to polling by Civiqs , more than 50 percent of registered voters now say they support the movement .
The cascading effect of these protests has been something to behold . The commissioner of the N.F.L. , which blackballed Colin Kaepernick for daring to respectfully protest police brutality , announced that the N.F.L . had , in fact , been wrong and that black lives actually do matter . ( Kaepernick , on the other hand , still has no job . ) HBO Max announced that it would temporarily pull from its roster the Lost Cause propaganda film “ Gone With the Wind ” — which in classically American fashion holds the spot as the highest-grossing feature film of all time . NASCAR came to the sudden realization that its decades-long permissiveness toward fans ’ waving the battle flag of a traitorous would-be nation that fought to preserve the right to traffic black people was , in fact , contrary to its “ commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans , our competitors and our industry. ” Bubba Wallace , the only full-time black driver at the sport ’ s top level , who had called on NASCAR to make the move , drove victory laps in an all-black stock car emblazoned with the words “ # BLACKLIVESMATTER . ”

Multiracial groups of Americans have defaced or snatched down monuments to enslavers and bigots from Virginia to Philadelphia to Minneapolis and New Mexico , leading local and state politicians to locate the moral courage to realize that they indeed did have the power to purge from public spaces icons to white supremacy . Even the University of Alabama , the place where Gov . George Wallace quite literally stood in the schoolhouse door to try to block the court-ordered admission of two black students , a place whose Grecian-columned campus and still largely segregated sororities pose the living embodiment of Dixie , is removing three plaques honoring Confederate soldiers and will study whether to rename buildings holding the monikers of enslavers and white supremacists after a student-led campaign garnered more than 17,000 signatures .
Unlike so many times in the past , in which black people mostly marched and protested alone to demand recognition of their full humanity and citizenship , a multiracial and multigenerational protest army has taken to the streets over the last month . They ’ ve spread across all 50 states in places big and small , including historically all-white towns like Vidor , Texas , where as recently as 1993 a federal judge had to order its public housing integrated . Shortly after , white supremacists ran out of town the handful of black people who had moved in . That Vidor , Texas , which remains 91 percent white and 0.5 percent black , held a Black Lives Matter rally in early June . In countries as disparate as England , Brazil , Kenya and Turkey , crowds pumped fists and carried signs with George Floyd ’ s name .
And this month , a Monmouth University poll showed that 76 percent of Americans , and 71 percent of white Americans , believe that racial and ethnic discrimination is a “ big problem ” in the United States . Just a few years ago , little more than half of white Americans believed that . The numbers in the Monmouth poll were so high that it left some political scientists questioning the poll ’ s quality .
“ This number is crazy , ” Hakeem Jefferson , a Stanford University political scientist , told me . “ When I saw it , I thought , ‘ This is a polling error. ’ So I did what good social scientists do . I opened the methodological report , worried that they had done a weird sampling . But this is high-quality data . ”
It is hard in the midst of something momentous to pinpoint exactly what has caused it . What we ’ re seeing is most likely a result of unrelenting organizing by the Black Lives Matter movement . It ’ s the pandemic , which virtually overnight left staggering numbers of Americans without enough money to buy food , pay rent and sustain their businesses . For many white Americans who may have once , consciously or unconsciously , looked down upon this nation ’ s heavily black and brown low-wage service workers , Covid-19 made them realize that it was the delivery driver and grocery clerk and meatpacker who made it possible for them to remain safely sequestered in their homes — and these workers were dying for it . Black Americans , in particular , have borne a disproportionate number of deaths from both Covid-19 and law enforcement , and many nonblack protesters have reasoned that black people should not have to risk their lives alone in taking to the streets demanding that the state not execute its citizens without consequence . And as they did , white Americans both in the streets and through the screens of their phones and televisions got a taste of the wanton police violence that black Americans regularly face . They saw the police beating up white women , pushing down an elderly white man and throwing tear gas and shooting rubber bullets at demonstrators exercising their democratic right to peacefully protest .
With so many Americans working from home or not working at all , they have had the time to show up to protests every day . These protests not only give Americans who are not black a moral reason to leave their homes after weeks of social isolation ; they also allow protesters to vent anger at the incompetence of the man in the White House , himself a product of this nation ’ s inability to escape its death pact with white supremacy , who they sense is imperiling this terribly flawed but miraculous country .
It has been more than 150 years since the white planter class last called up the slave patrols and deputized every white citizen to stop , question and subdue any black person who came across their paths in order to control and surveil a population who refused to submit to their enslavement . It has been 150 years since white Americans could enforce slave laws that said white people acting in the interest of the planter class would not be punished for killing a black person , even for the most minor alleged offense . Those laws morphed into the black codes , passed by white Southern politicians at the end of the Civil War to criminalize behaviors like not having a job . Those black codes were struck down , then altered and over the course of decades eventually transmuted into stop-and-frisk , broken windows and , of course , qualified immunity . The names of the mechanisms of social control have changed , but the presumption that white patrollers have the legal right to kill black people deemed to have committed minor infractions or to have breached the social order has remained .
In a country erected on the explicitly codified conviction that black lives mattered less , graveyards across this land hold the bodies of black Americans , men , women and children , legally killed by the institutional descendants of those slave patrols for alleged transgressions like walking from the store with Skittles , playing with a toy gun in the park , sleeping in their homes and selling untaxed cigarettes . We collectively know only a small number of their names : Michael Brown , Tamir Rice , Trayvon Martin , Kendra James , Breonna Taylor , Rekia Boyd , Eric Garner , Aiyana Stanley-Jones and Tanisha Anderson are just a few .
And because of what is happening now , George Floyd ’ s name will forever stand out since enough Americans have decided that his death mattered .
What has spawned this extraordinary reckoning , the fire this time , was our collective witness of what must be described without hyperbole as a modern-day lynching . In his 1933 book , “ The Tragedy of Lynching , ” the sociologist Arthur F. Raper estimated that , based on his study of 100 lynchings , white police officers participated in at least half of all lynchings and that in 90 percent of others law-enforcement officers “ either condone or wink at the mob action. ” The nonchalant look on Officer Derek Chauvin ’ s face — as , hand in pocket , for 8 minutes 46 seconds , he pressed his knee against the neck of a facedown black man begging for his life — reminds me of every callous white face captured in the grisly photos taken in the 1900s to mark the gleeful spectacle of the public killings of black men and women .
It devastates black people that all the other black deaths before George Floyd did not get us here . It devastates black people to recall all the excuses that have come before . That big black boy , Michael Brown , must have charged the weapon-carrying officer . Eric Garner should have stopped struggling . Breonna Taylor ’ s boyfriend had a weapon in her home and shouldn ’ t have shot at the people who , without a knock or an announcement , burst through her door . We ’ re not sure what Ahmaud Arbery was doing in that predominantly white neighborhood . Rayshard Brooks , who in the midst of nationwide protests against police violence was shot in the back twice by a police officer , just shouldn ’ t have resisted .
It should devastate us all that in 2020 it took a cellphone video broadcast across the globe of a black man dying from the oldest and most terrifying tool in the white-supremacist arsenal to make a vast majority of white Americans decide that , well , this might be enough .
We , now , have finally arrived at the point of this essay . Because when it comes to truly explaining racial injustice in this country , the table should never be set quickly : There is too much to know , and yet we aggressively choose not to know it .
No one can predict whether this uprising will lead to lasting change . History does not bode well . But there does seem to be a widespread acceptance of the most obvious action we could take toward equality in a nation built on the espoused ideals of inalienable , universal rights : pass reforms and laws that ensure that black people can not be killed by armed agents of the state without consequence .
But on its own , this can not bring justice to America . If we are truly at the precipice of a transformative moment , the most tragic of outcomes would be that the demand be too timid and the resolution too small . If we are indeed serious about creating a more just society , we must go much further than that . We must get to the root of it .
Fifty years since the bloody and brutally repressed protests and freedom struggles of black Americans brought about the end of legal discrimination in this country , so much of what makes black lives hard , what takes black lives earlier , what causes black Americans to be vulnerable to the type of surveillance and policing that killed Breonna Taylor and George Floyd , what steals opportunities , is the lack of wealth that has been a defining feature of black life since the end of slavery .
Wealth , not income , is the means to security in America . Wealth — assets and investments minus debt — is what enables you to buy homes in safer neighborhoods with better amenities and better-funded schools . It is what enables you to send your children to college without saddling them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and what provides you money to put a down payment on a house . It is what prevents family emergencies or unexpected job losses from turning into catastrophes that leave you homeless and destitute . It is what ensures what every parent wants — that your children will have fewer struggles than you did . Wealth is security and peace of mind . It ’ s not incidental that wealthier people are healthier and live longer . Wealth is , as a recent Yale study states , “ the most consequential index of economic well-being ” for most Americans . But wealth is not something people create solely by themselves ; it is accumulated across generations .
While unchecked discrimination still plays a significant role in shunting opportunities for black Americans , it is white Americans ’ centuries-long economic head start that most effectively maintains racial caste today . As soon as laws began to ban racial discrimination against black Americans , white Americans created so-called race-neutral means of maintaining political and economic power . For example , soon after the 15th Amendment granted black men the right to vote , white politicians in many states , understanding that recently freed black Americans were impoverished , implemented poll taxes . In other words , white Americans have long known that in a country where black people have been kept disproportionately poor and prevented from building wealth , rules and policies involving money can be nearly as effective for maintaining the color line as legal segregation . You do not have to have laws forcing segregated housing and schools if white Americans , using their generational wealth and higher incomes , can simply buy their way into expensive enclaves with exclusive public schools that are out of the price range of most black Americans .
It has worked with impressive efficiency . Today black Americans remain the most segregated group of people in America and are five times as likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods as white Americans . Not even high earnings inoculate black people against racialized disadvantage . Black families earning $ 75,000 or more a year live in poorer neighborhoods than white Americans earning less than $ 40,000 a year , research by John Logan , a Brown University sociologist , shows . According to another study , by the Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon and his colleagues , the average black family earning $ 100,000 a year lives in a neighborhood with an average annual income of $ 54,000 . Black Americans with high incomes are still black : They face discrimination across American life . But it is because their families have not been able to build wealth that they are often unable to come up with a down payment to buy in more affluent neighborhoods , while white Americans with lower incomes often use familial wealth to do so .
The difference between the lived experience of black Americans and white Americans when it comes to wealth — along the entire spectrum of income from the poorest to the richest — can be described as nothing other than a chasm . According to research published this year by scholars at Duke University and Northwestern University that doesn ’ t even take into account the yet-unknown financial wreckage of Covid-19 , the average black family with children holds just one cent of wealth for every dollar that the average white family with children holds .
As President Johnson , architect of the Great Society , explained in a 1965 speech titled “ To Fulfill These Rights ” : “ Negro poverty is not white poverty . … These differences are not racial differences . They are solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality , past injustice and present prejudice . They are anguishing to observe . For the Negro they are a constant reminder of oppression . For the white they are a constant reminder of guilt . But they must be faced , and they must be dealt with , and they must be overcome ; if we are ever to reach the time when the only difference between Negroes and whites is the color of their skin . ”
We sometimes forget , and perhaps it is an intentional forgetting , that the racism we are fighting today was originally conjured to justify working unfree black people , often until death , to generate extravagant riches for European colonial powers , the white planter class and all the ancillary white people from Midwestern farmers to bankers to sailors to textile workers , who earned their living and built their wealth from free black labor and the products that labor produced . The prosperity of this country is inextricably linked with the forced labor of the ancestors of 40 million black Americans for whom these marches are now occurring , just as it is linked to the stolen land of the country ’ s indigenous people . Though our high school history books seldom make this plain : Slavery and the 100-year period of racial apartheid and racial terrorism known as Jim Crow were , above all else , systems of economic exploitation . To borrow from Ta-Nehisi Coates ’ s phrasing , racism is the child of economic profiteering , not the father .
Numerous legal efforts to strip black people of their humanity existed to justify the extraction of profit . Beginning in the 1660s , white officials ensured that all children born to enslaved women would also be enslaved and belong not to their mothers but to the white men who owned their mothers . They passed laws dictating that the child ’ s status would follow that of the mother not the father , upending European norms and guaranteeing that the children of enslaved women who were sexually assaulted by white men would be born enslaved and not free . It meant that profit for white people could be made from black women ’ s wombs . Laws determining that enslaved people , just like animals , had no recognized kinship ties ensured that human beings could be bought and sold at will to pay debts , buy more acres or save storied universities like Georgetown from closing . Laws barred enslaved people from making wills or owning property , distinguishing black people in America from every other group on these shores and assuring that everything of value black people managed to accrue would add to the wealth of those who enslaved them . At the time of the Civil War , the value of the enslaved human beings held as property added up to more than all of this nations ’ railroads and factories combined . And yet , enslaved people saw not a dime of this wealth . They owned nothing and were owed nothing from all that had been built from their toil .
Slavery ’ s demise provided this nation the chance for redemption . Out of the ashes of sectarian strife , we could have birthed a new country , one that recognized the humanity and natural rights of those who helped forge this country , one that attempted to atone and provide redress for the unspeakable atrocities committed against black people in the name of profit . We could have finally , 100 years after the Revolution , embraced its founding ideals .
And , oh so briefly , during the period known as Reconstruction , we moved toward that goal . The historian Eric Foner refers to these 12 years after the Civil War as this nation ’ s second founding , because it is here that America began to redeem the grave sin of slavery . Congress passed amendments abolishing human bondage , enshrining equal protection before the law in the Constitution and guaranteeing black men the right to vote . This nation witnessed its first period of biracial governance as the formerly enslaved were elected to public offices at all levels of government . For a fleeting moment , a few white men listened to the pleas of black people who had fought for the Union and helped deliver its victory . Land in this country has always meant wealth and , more important , independence . Millions of black people , liberated with not a cent to their name , desperately wanted property so they could work , support themselves and be left alone . Black people implored federal officials to take the land confiscated from enslavers who had taken up arms against their own country and grant it to those who worked it for generations . They were asking to , as the historian Robin D.G . Kelley puts it , “ inherit the earth they had turned into wealth for idle white people . ”
In January 1865 , Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Order 15 , providing for the distribution of hundreds of thousands of acres of former Confederate land issued in 40-acre tracts to newly freed people along coastal South Carolina and Georgia . But just four months later , in April , Lincoln was assassinated . Andrew Johnson , the racist , pro-Southern vice president who took over , immediately reneged upon this promise of 40 acres , overturning Sherman ’ s order . Most white Americans felt that black Americans should be grateful for their freedom , that the bloody Civil War had absolved any debt . The government confiscated the land from the few formerly enslaved families who had started to eke out a life away from the white whip and gave it back to the traitors . And with that , the only real effort this nation ever made to compensate black Americans for 250 years of chattel slavery ended .
Freed people , during and after slavery , tried again and again to compel the government to provide restitution for slavery , to provide at the very least a pension for those who spent their entire lives working for no pay . They filed lawsuits . They organized to lobby politicians . And every effort failed . To this day , the only Americans who have ever received government restitution for slavery were white enslavers in Washington , D.C. , who were compensated for their loss of human property .
The way we are taught this in school , Lincoln “ freed the slaves , ” and then the nearly four million people who the day before had been treated as property suddenly enjoyed the privileges of being Americans like everyone else . We are not prodded to contemplate what it means to achieve freedom without a home to live in , without food to eat , a bed to sleep on , clothes for your children or money to buy any of it . Narratives collected of formerly enslaved people during the Federal Writers ’ Project of the 1930s reveal the horrors of massive starvation , of “ liberated ” black people seeking shelter in burned-out buildings and scrounging for food in decaying fields before eventually succumbing to the heartbreak of returning to bend over in the fields of their former enslavers , as sharecroppers , just so they would not die . “ With the advent of emancipation , ” writes the historian Keri Leigh Merritt , “ blacks became the only race in the U.S. ever to start out , as an entire people , with close to zero capital . ”
In 1881 , Frederick Douglass , surveying the utter privation in which the federal government left the formerly enslaved , wrote : “ When the Hebrews were emancipated , they were told to take spoil from the Egyptians . When the serfs of Russia were emancipated , they were given three acres of ground upon which they could live and make a living . But not so when our slaves were emancipated . They were sent away empty-handed , without money , without friends and without a foot of land on which they could live and make a living . Old and young , sick and well , were turned loose to the naked sky , naked to their enemies . ”
Just after the federal government decided that black people were undeserving of restitution , it began bestowing millions of acres in the West to white Americans under the Homestead Act , while also enticing white foreigners to immigrate with the offer of free land . From 1868 to 1934 , the federal government gave away 246 million acres in 160-acre tracts , nearly 10 percent of all the land in the nation , to more than 1.5 million white families , native-born and foreign . As Merritt points out , some 46 million American adults today , nearly 20 percent of all American adults , descend from those homesteaders . “ If that many white Americans can trace their legacy of wealth and property ownership to a single entitlement program , ” Merritt writes , “ then the perpetuation of black poverty must also be linked to national policy . ”
The federal government turned its back on its financial obligations to four million newly liberated people , and then it left them without protection as well , as white rule was reinstated across the South starting in the 1880s . Federal troops pulled out of the South , and white Southerners overthrew biracial governance using violence , coups and election fraud .
The campaigns of white terror that marked the period after Reconstruction , known as Redemption , once again guaranteed an exploitable , dependent labor force for the white South . Most black Southerners had no desire to work on the same forced-labor camps where they had just been enslaved . But white Southerners passed state laws that made it a crime if they didn ’ t sign labor contracts with white landowners or changed employers without permission or sold cotton after sunset , and then as punishment for these “ crimes , ” black people were forcibly leased out to companies and individuals . Through sharecropping and convict leasing , black people were compelled back into quasi slavery . This arrangement ensured that once-devasted towns like Greenwood , Miss. , were again able to call themselves the cotton capitals of the world , and companies like United States Steel secured a steady supply of unfree black laborers who could be worked to death , in what Douglass A. Blackmon , in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book , calls “ slavery by another name . ”
Yet black Americans persisted , and despite the odds , some managed to acquire land , start businesses and build schools for their children . But it was the most prosperous black people and communities that elicited the most vicious response . Lynchings , massacres and generalized racial terrorism were regularly deployed against black people who had bought land , opened schools , built thriving communities , tried to organize sharecroppers ’ unions or opened their own businesses , depriving white owners of economic monopolies and the opportunity to cheat black buyers .
At least 6,500 black people were lynched from the end of the Civil War to 1950 , an average of nearly two a week for nine decades . Nearly five black people , on average , have been killed a week by law enforcement since 2015 .
The scale of the destruction during the 1900s is incalculable . Black farms were stolen , shops burned to the ground . Entire prosperous black neighborhoods and communities were razed by white mobs from Florida to North Carolina to Atlanta to Arkansas . One of the most infamous of these , and yet still widely unknown among white Americans , occurred in Tulsa , Okla. , when gangs of white men , armed with guns supplied by public officials , destroyed a black district so successful that it was known as Black Wall Street . They burned more than 1,200 homes and businesses , including a department store , a library and a hospital , and killed hundreds who it is believed were buried in mass graves . In 2001 , a commission on the massacre recommended that the state pay financial restitution for the victims , but the State Legislature refused . And this is the place that in the midst of weeks of protests crying out for black lives to matter , Donald Trump , nearly 100 years later , chose to restart his campaign rallies .

Even black Americans who did not experience theft and violence were continuously deprived of the ability to build wealth . They were denied entry into labor unions and union jobs that ensured middle-class wages . North and South , racist hiring laws and policies forced them into service jobs , even when they earned college degrees . They were legally relegated into segregated , substandard neighborhoods and segregated , substandard schools that made it impossible to compete economically even had they not faced rampant discrimination in the job market . In the South , for most of the period after the Civil War until the 1960s , nearly all the black people who wanted to earn professional degrees — law , medical and master ’ s degrees — had to leave the region to do so even as white immigrants attended state colleges in the former Confederacy that black American tax dollars helped pay for .
As part of the New Deal programs , the federal government created redlining maps , marking neighborhoods where black people lived in red ink to denote that they were uninsurable . As a result , 98 percent of the loans the Federal Housing Administration insured from 1934 to 1962 went to white Americans , locking nearly all black Americans out of the government program credited with building the modern ( white ) middle class .
“ At the very moment a wide array of public policies was providing most white Americans with valuable tools to advance their social welfare — ensure their old age , get good jobs , acquire economic security , build assets and gain middle-class status — most black Americans were left behind or left out , ” the historian Ira Katznelson writes in his book , “ When Affirmative Action Was White. ” “ The federal government … functioned as a commanding instrument of white privilege . ”
In other words , while black Americans were being systematically , generationally deprived of the ability to build wealth , while also being robbed of the little they had managed to gain , white Americans were not only free to earn money and accumulate wealth with exclusive access to the best jobs , best schools , best credit terms , but they were also getting substantial government help in doing so .
The civil rights movement ostensibly ended white advantage by law . And in the gauzy way white Americans tend to view history , particularly the history of racial inequality , the end of legal discrimination , after 350 years , is all that was required to vanquish this dark history and its effects . Changing the laws , too many Americans have believed , marked the end of the obligation . But civil rights laws passed in the 1960s merely guaranteed black people rights they should have always had . They dictated that from that day forward , the government would no longer sanction legal racial discrimination . But these laws did not correct the harm nor restore what was lost .
Brown v. Board of Education did not end segregated and unequal schools ; it just ended segregation in the law . It took court orders and , at times , federal troops to see any real integration . Nevertheless , more than six decades after the nation ’ s highest court proclaimed school segregation unconstitutional , black children remain as segregated from white kids as they were in the early 1970s . There has never been a point in American history where even half the black children in this country have attended a majority-white school .
Making school segregation illegal did nothing to repay black families for the theft of their educations or make up for generations of black Americans , many of them still living , who could never go to college because white officials believed that only white students needed a high school education and so refused to operate high schools for black children . As late as the 1930s , most communities in the South , where the vast majority of black Americans lived , failed to provide a single public high school for black children , according to “ The Education of Blacks in the South , 1860-1935 , ” by the historian James D. Anderson . Heavily black Richmond County in Georgia , for instance , did not provide a four-year black high school from 1897 to 1945 .
The Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination in housing , but it did not reset real estate values so that homes in redlined black neighborhoods whose prices were artificially deflated would be valued the same as identical homes in white neighborhoods , which had been artificially inflated . It did not provide restitution for generations of black homeowners forced into predatory loans because they had been locked out of the prime credit market . It did not repay every black soldier who returned from World War II to find that he could not use his G.I . Bill to buy a home for his family in any of the new whites-only suburbs subsidized by the same government he fought for . It did not break up the still-entrenched housing segregation that took decades of government and private policy to create . Lay those redlining maps over almost any city in America with a significant black population , and you will see that the government-sanctioned segregation patterns remain stubbornly intact and that those same communities bore the brunt of the predatory lending and foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s that stole years of black homeownership and wealth gains .
Making employment discrimination illegal did not come with a check for black Americans to compensate for all the high-paying jobs they were legally barred from , for the promotions they never got solely because of their race , for the income and opportunities lost to the centuries of discrimination . Nor did these laws end ongoing discrimination any more than speed limits without enforcement stop people from driving too fast . These laws opened up opportunities for limited numbers of black Americans while largely leaving centuries of meticulously orchestrated inequities soundly in place , but now with the sheen of colorblind magnanimity .
The inclination to bandage over and move on is a definitive American feature when it comes to anti-black racism and its social and material effects . A joint 2019 study by faculty members at Yale University ’ s School of Management , Department of Psychology and Institute for Social and Policy Studies describes this phenomenon this way : “ A firm belief in our nation ’ s commitment to racial egalitarianism is part of the collective consciousness of the United States of America . … We have a strong and persistent belief that our national disgrace of racial oppression has been overcome , albeit through struggle , and that racial equality has largely been achieved. ” The authors point out how white Americans love to play up moments of racial progress like the Emancipation Proclamation , Brown v. Board of Education and the election of Barack Obama , while playing down or ignoring lynching , racial apartheid or the 1985 bombing of a black neighborhood in Philadelphia . “ When it comes to race relations in the United States … most Americans hold an unyielding belief in a specific , optimistic narrative regarding racial progress that is robust to counterexamples : that society has come a very long way already and is moving rapidly , perhaps naturally toward full racial equality . ”
This remarkable imperviousness to facts when it comes to white advantage and architected black disadvantage is what emboldens some white Americans to quote the passage from Martin Luther King ’ s 1963 “ I Have A Dream ” speech about being judged by the content of your character and not by the color of your skin . It ’ s often used as a cudgel against calls for race-specific remedies for black Americans — while ignoring the part of that same speech where King says black people have marched on the capital to cash “ a check which has come back marked ‘ insufficient funds . ’ ”
King has been evoked continuously during this season of protests , sometimes to defend those who looted and torched buildings , sometimes to condemn them . But in this time of foment , there has been an astounding silence around his most radical demands . The seldom-quoted King is the one who said that the true battle for equality , the actualization of justice , required economic repair .
After watching Northern cities explode even as his movement ’ s efforts to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act came to fruition , King gave a speech in 1967 in Atlanta before the Hungry Club Forum , a secret gathering of white politicians and civil rights leaders .
King said : “ For well now 12 years , the struggle was basically a struggle to end legal segregation . In a sense it was a struggle for decency . It was a struggle to get rid of all of the humiliation and the syndrome of depravation surrounding the system of legal segregation . And I need not remind you that those were glorious days . … It is now a struggle for genuine equality on all levels , and this will be a much more difficult struggle . You see , the gains in the first period , or the first era of struggle , were obtained from the power structure at bargain rates ; it didn ’ t cost the nation anything to integrate lunch counters . It didn ’ t cost the nation anything to integrate hotels and motels . It didn ’ t cost the nation a penny to guarantee the right to vote . Now we are in a period where it will cost the nation billions of dollars to get rid of poverty , to get rid of slums , to make quality integrated education a reality . This is where we are now . Now we ’ re going to lose some friends in this period . The allies who were with us in Selma will not all stay with us during this period . We ’ ve got to understand what is happening . Now they often call this the white backlash . … It ’ s just a new name for an old phenomenon . The fact is that there has never been any single , solid , determined commitment on the part of the vast majority of white Americans to genuine equality for Negroes . ”
A year later , in March 1968 , just a month before his assassination , in a speech to striking , impoverished black sanitation workers in Memphis , King said : “ Now our struggle is for genuine equality , which means economic equality . For we know that it isn ’ t enough to integrate lunch counters . What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn ’ t have enough money to buy a hamburger ? ”
As we focus on police violence , we can not ignore an even starker indication of our societal failures : Racial income disparities today look no different than they did the decade before King ’ s March on Washington . In 1950 , according to a forthcoming study by the economists Moritz Schularick , Moritz Kuhn and Ulrike Steins in The Journal of Political Economy , black median household income was about half that of white Americans , and today it remains so . More critical , the racial wealth gap is about the same as it was in the 1950s as well . The typical black household today is poorer than 80 percent of white households . “ No progress has been made over the past 70 years in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households , ” according to the study .
And yet most Americans are in an almost pathological denial about the depth of black financial struggle . That 2019 Yale University study , called “ The Misperception of Racial Economic Inequality , ” found that Americans believe that black households hold $ 90 in wealth for every $ 100 held by white households . The actual amount is $ 10 .
About 97 percent of study participants overestimated black-white wealth equality , and most assumed that highly educated , high-income black households were the most likely to achieve economic parity with white counterparts . That is also wrong . The magnitude of the wealth gap only widens as black people earn more income .
“ These data suggest that Americans are largely unaware of the striking persistence of racial economic inequality in the United States , ” the study ’ s authors write . Americans , they write , tend to explain away or justify persistent racial inequality by ignoring the “ tailwinds that have contributed to their economic success while justifying inequalities of wealth and poverty by invoking the role of individuals ’ traits and skills as explanations for these disparities. ” They use the exceptional examples of very successful black people to prove that systemic racism does not hold black Americans back and point to the large numbers of impoverished black people as evidence that black people are largely responsible for their own struggles .
In 2018 , Duke University ’ s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity and the Insight Center for Community Economic Development published a report called “ What We Get Wrong About Closing the Racial Wealth Gap ” that examined the common misperceptions about the causes of the racial wealth gap and presented data and social-science research that refutes them all .
The study shows that the racial wealth gap is not about poverty . Poor white families earning less than $ 27,000 a year hold nearly the same amount of wealth as black families earning between $ 48,000 and $ 76,000 annually . It ’ s not because of black spending habits . Black Americans have lower incomes over all but save at a slightly higher rate than white Americans with similar incomes . It ’ s not that black people need to value education more . Black parents , when controlling for household type and socioeconomic status , actually offer more financial support for their children ’ s higher education than white parents do , according to the study . And some studies have shown that black youths , when compared with white youths whose parents have similar incomes and education levels , are actually more likely to go to college and earn additional credentials .
But probably most astounding to many Americans is that college simply does not pay off for black Americans the way it does for other groups . Black college graduates are about as likely to be unemployed as white Americans with a high school diploma , and black Americans with a college education hold less wealth than white Americans who have not even completed high school . Further , because black families hold almost no wealth to begin with , black students are the most likely to borrow money to pay for college and then to borrow more . That debt , in turn , means that black students can not start saving immediately upon graduation like their less-debt-burdened peers .
It ’ s not a lack of homeownership . While it ’ s true that black Americans have the lowest homeownership rates in the nation , simply owning a home is not the same asset that it is for white Americans . Black Americans get higher mortgage rates even with equal credit worthiness , and homes in black neighborhoods do not appreciate at the same rate as those in white areas , because housing prices are still driven by the racial makeup of communities . As the Duke University economist William Darity Jr. , the study ’ s lead author , points out , the ability to purchase a home in the first place is seldom a result of just the hard work and frugality of the buyer . “ It ’ s actually parental and grandparental wealth that facilitates the acquisition of a home . ”
It ’ s not because a majority of black families are led by a single mother . White single women with children hold the same amount of wealth as single black women with no children , and the typical white single parent has twice the wealth of the typical two-parent black family .
To summarize , none of the actions we are told black people must take if they want to “ lift themselves ” out of poverty and gain financial stability — not marrying , not getting educated , not saving more , not owning a home — can mitigate 400 years of racialized plundering . Wealth begets wealth , and white Americans have had centuries of government assistance to accumulate wealth , while the government has for the vast history of this country worked against black Americans doing the same .
“ The cause of the gap must be found in the structural characteristics of the American economy , heavily infused at every point with both an inheritance of racism and the ongoing authority of white supremacy , ” the authors of the Duke study write . “ There are no actions that black Americans can take unilaterally that will have much of an effect on reducing the wealth gap . For the gap to be closed , America must undergo a vast social transformation produced by the adoption of bold national policies . ”
At the center of those policies must be reparations . “ The process of creating the racial wealth chasm begins with the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40 acres they were promised , ” Darity told me . “ So the restitution has never been given , and it ’ s 155 years overdue . ”
Darity has been studying and advocating reparations for 30 years , and this spring he and his partner , A. Kirsten Mullen , published the book “ From Here to Equality : Reparations for Black Americans in the 21st Century. ” Both history and road map , the book answers the questions about who should receive reparations and how a program would work . I will not spend much time on that here , except to make these few points . Reparations are not about punishing white Americans , and white Americans are not the ones who would pay for them . It does not matter if your ancestors engaged in slavery or if you just immigrated here two weeks ago . Reparations are a societal obligation in a nation where our Constitution sanctioned slavery , Congress passed laws protecting it and our federal government initiated , condoned and practiced legal racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans until half a century ago . And so it is the federal government that pays .
Reparations would go to any person who has documentation that he or she identified as a black person for at least 10 years before the beginning of any reparations process and can trace at least one ancestor back to American slavery . Reparations should include a commitment to vigorously enforcing existing civil rights prohibitions against housing , educational and employment discrimination , as well as targeted investments in government-constructed segregated black communities and the segregated schools that serve a disproportionate number of black children . But critically , reparations must include individual cash payments to descendants of the enslaved in order to close the wealth gap .
The technical details , frankly , are the easier part . The real obstacle , the obstacle that we have never overcome , is garnering the political will — convincing enough Americans that the centuries-long forced economic disadvantage of black Americans should be remedied , that restitution is owed to people who have never had an equal chance to take advantage of the bounty they played such a significant part in creating .
This country can be remarkably generous . Each year Congress allocates money — this year $ 5 million — to help support Holocaust survivors living in America . In backing the funding measure , Representative Richard E. Neal , a Democrat from Massachusetts , said in 2018 that this country has a “ responsibility to support the surviving men and women of the Holocaust and their families. ” And he is right . It is the moral thing to do . And yet Congress has refused for three decades to pass H.R . 40 , a bill to simply study the issue of reparations . Its drafter , Representative John Conyers Jr. , a Michigan Democrat and descendant of enslaved Americans , died in 2019 — during the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans enslaved in Virginia — without the bill ever making it out of committee .
There are living victims of racial apartheid and terrorism born in this country , including civil rights activists who lost their homes and jobs fighting to make this country a democracy , who have never received any sort of restitution for what they endured . Soon , like their enslaved ancestors , they will all be dead , too , and then we ’ ll hear the worn excuse that this country owes no reparations because none of the victims are still alive . Darity and Mullen call this the “ delay until death ” tactic . Procrastination , they say , does not erase what is owed .
The coronavirus pandemic has dispatched the familiar lament that even if it is the right thing to do , this nation simply can not afford to make restitution to the 40 million descendants of American slavery . It took Congress just a matter of weeks to pass a $ 2.2 trillion stimulus bill to help families and businesses struggling from the Covid-19 shutdowns . When , then , will this nation pass a stimulus package to finally respond to the singularity of black suffering ?
Colossal societal ruptures have been the only things potent enough to birth transformative racial change in this country , and perhaps a viral pandemic colliding with our nation ’ s 400-year racial one has forced that type of rupture today . Maybe it had to be this way ; this deep and collective suffering was necessary for white Americans to feel enough of the pain that black Americans have always known to tilt the scale .
With Covid-19 , black Americans face a financial catastrophe unlike any in nearly a century . Black Americans had already lost the largest share of their wealth of all racial groups as a result of the last recession and have struggled the most to recover . They are the only racial group whose household median income is less than it was in 2000 . Today already more than half of black adults are out of work . Black businesses are withering . Their owners were almost completely shut out of the federal paycheck-protection program — just 12 percent of black and Latino business owners who applied for the small-business loans received the full amounts they requested , according to a Global Strategy Group survey last month . Nearly half the respondents said they would most likely shutter permanently within six months . Black children are expected to lose 10 months ’ worth of academic gains because of school closures , more than any other group , and yet they attend the schools with the least resources already , schools that will have even fewer resources as states slash spending to make up for budget shortfalls . One in five black homeowners and one in four renters have missed at least one home payment since the shutdowns began — the highest of all racial groups .
The pandemic , Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor , a scholar of social movements and racial inequality at Princeton University , told me , “ has pulled what is hidden and buried on the bottom to the surface so that it can ’ t actually be ignored . It is a radicalizing factor because conditions that have been so dire , now combined with revolts in the street , might lead one to believe that not only is the society unraveling , but it might cause you to question what foundation it was built upon in the first place . ”
Race-neutral policies simply will not address the depth of disadvantage faced by people this country once believed were chattel . Financial restitution can not end racism , of course , but it can certainly mitigate racism ’ s most devastating effects . If we do nothing , black Americans may never recover from this pandemic , and they will certainly never know the equality the nation has promised .
So we are left with a choice . Will this moment only feel different ? Or will it actually be different ?
If black lives are to truly matter in America , this nation must move beyond slogans and symbolism . Citizens don ’ t inherit just the glory of their nation , but its wrongs too . A truly great country does not ignore or excuse its sins . It confronts them and then works to make them right . If we are to be redeemed , if we are to live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded , we must do what is just .
It is time for this country to pay its debt . It is time for reparations .

Black Americans protesting the violation of their rights are a defining tradition of this country. In the last century, there have been hundreds of uprisings in black communities in response to white violence. Some have produced substantive change. After the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, uprisings in more than 100 cities broke the final congressional deadlock over whether it should be illegal to deny people housing simply because they descended from people who had been enslaved. The Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race, gender and religion, among other categories, seemed destined to die in Congress as white Southerners were joined by many of their Northern counterparts who knew housing segregation was central to how Jim Crow was accomplished in the North. But just seven days after King’s death, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law from the smoldering capital, which was still under protection from the National Guard.

Most of the time these uprisings have produced hand-wringing and consternation but few necessary structural changes. After black uprisings swept the nation in the mid-1960s, Johnson created the Kerner Commission to examine their causes, and the report it issued in 1968 recommended a national effort to dismantle segregation and structural racism across American institutions. It was shelved by the president, like so many similar reports, and instead white Americans voted in a “law and order” president, Richard Nixon. The following decades brought increased police militarization, law-enforcement spending and mass incarceration of black Americans.

The changes we’re seeing today in some ways seem shockingly swift, and in other ways rage-inducingly slow. After years of black-led activism, protest and organizing, the weeks of protests since George Floyd’s killing have moved lawmakers to ban chokeholds by police officers, consider stripping law enforcement of the qualified immunity that has made it almost impossible to hold responsible officers who kill, and discuss moving significant parts of ballooning police budgets into funding for social services. Black Lives Matter, the group founded in 2013 by three black women, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s killer, saw its support among American voters rise almost as much in the two weeks after Floyd’s killing than in the last two years. According to polling by Civiqs, more than 50 percent of registered voters now say they support the movement.

The cascading effect of these protests has been something to behold. The commissioner of the N.F.L., which blackballed Colin Kaepernick for daring to respectfully protest police brutality, announced that the N.F.L. had, in fact, been wrong and that black lives actually do matter. (Kaepernick, on the other hand, still has no job.) HBO Max announced that it would temporarily pull from its roster the Lost Cause propaganda film “Gone With the Wind” — which in classically American fashion holds the spot as the highest-grossing feature film of all time. NASCAR came to the sudden realization that its decades-long permissiveness toward fans’ waving the battle flag of a traitorous would-be nation that fought to preserve the right to traffic black people was, in fact, contrary to its “commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.” Bubba Wallace, the only full-time black driver at the sport’s top level, who had called on NASCAR to make the move, drove victory laps in an all-black stock car emblazoned with the words “#BLACKLIVESMATTER.”

Multiracial groups of Americans have defaced or snatched down monuments to enslavers and bigots from Virginia to Philadelphia to Minneapolis and New Mexico, leading local and state politicians to locate the moral courage to realize that they indeed did have the power to purge from public spaces icons to white supremacy. Even the University of Alabama, the place where Gov. George Wallace quite literally stood in the schoolhouse door to try to block the court-ordered admission of two black students, a place whose Grecian-columned campus and still largely segregated sororities pose the living embodiment of Dixie, is removing three plaques honoring Confederate soldiers and will study whether to rename buildings holding the monikers of enslavers and white supremacists after a student-led campaign garnered more than 17,000 signatures.

Unlike so many times in the past, in which black people mostly marched and protested alone to demand recognition of their full humanity and citizenship, a multiracial and multigenerational protest army has taken to the streets over the last month. They’ve spread across all 50 states in places big and small, including historically all-white towns like Vidor, Texas, where as recently as 1993 a federal judge had to order its public housing integrated. Shortly after, white supremacists ran out of town the handful of black people who had moved in. That Vidor, Texas, which remains 91 percent white and 0.5 percent black, held a Black Lives Matter rally in early June. In countries as disparate as England, Brazil, Kenya and Turkey, crowds pumped fists and carried signs with George Floyd’s name.

And this month, a Monmouth University poll showed that 76 percent of Americans, and 71 percent of white Americans, believe that racial and ethnic discrimination is a “big problem” in the United States. Just a few years ago, little more than half of white Americans believed that. The numbers in the Monmouth poll were so high that it left some political scientists questioning the poll’s quality.

“This number is crazy,” Hakeem Jefferson, a Stanford University political scientist, told me. “When I saw it, I thought, ‘This is a polling error.’ So I did what good social scientists do. I opened the methodological report, worried that they had done a weird sampling. But this is high-quality data.”

It is hard in the midst of something momentous to pinpoint exactly what has caused it. What we’re seeing is most likely a result of unrelenting organizing by the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s the pandemic, which virtually overnight left staggering numbers of Americans without enough money to buy food, pay rent and sustain their businesses. For many white Americans who may have once, consciously or unconsciously, looked down upon this nation’s heavily black and brown low-wage service workers, Covid-19 made them realize that it was the delivery driver and grocery clerk and meatpacker who made it possible for them to remain safely sequestered in their homes — and these workers were dying for it. Black Americans, in particular, have borne a disproportionate number of deaths from both Covid-19 and law enforcement, and many nonblack protesters have reasoned that black people should not have to risk their lives alone in taking to the streets demanding that the state not execute its citizens without consequence. And as they did, white Americans both in the streets and through the screens of their phones and televisions got a taste of the wanton police violence that black Americans regularly face. They saw the police beating up white women, pushing down an elderly white man and throwing tear gas and shooting rubber bullets at demonstrators exercising their democratic right to peacefully protest.

With so many Americans working from home or not working at all, they have had the time to show up to protests every day. These protests not only give Americans who are not black a moral reason to leave their homes after weeks of social isolation; they also allow protesters to vent anger at the incompetence of the man in the White House, himself a product of this nation’s inability to escape its death pact with white supremacy, who they sense is imperiling this terribly flawed but miraculous country.

It has been more than 150 years since the white planter class last called up the slave patrols and deputized every white citizen to stop, question and subdue any black person who came across their paths in order to control and surveil a population who refused to submit to their enslavement. It has been 150 years since white Americans could enforce slave laws that said white people acting in the interest of the planter class would not be punished for killing a black person, even for the most minor alleged offense. Those laws morphed into the black codes, passed by white Southern politicians at the end of the Civil War to criminalize behaviors like not having a job. Those black codes were struck down, then altered and over the course of decades eventually transmuted into stop-and-frisk, broken windows and, of course, qualified immunity. The names of the mechanisms of social control have changed, but the presumption that white patrollers have the legal right to kill black people deemed to have committed minor infractions or to have breached the social order has remained.

In a country erected on the explicitly codified conviction that black lives mattered less, graveyards across this land hold the bodies of black Americans, men, women and children, legally killed by the institutional descendants of those slave patrols for alleged transgressions like walking from the store with Skittles, playing with a toy gun in the park, sleeping in their homes and selling untaxed cigarettes. We collectively know only a small number of their names: Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Kendra James, Breonna Taylor, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Aiyana Stanley-Jones and Tanisha Anderson are just a few.

And because of what is happening now, George Floyd’s name will forever stand out since enough Americans have decided that his death mattered.

What has spawned this extraordinary reckoning, the fire this time, was our collective witness of what must be described without hyperbole as a modern-day lynching. In his 1933 book, “The Tragedy of Lynching,” the sociologist Arthur F. Raper estimated that, based on his study of 100 lynchings, white police officers participated in at least half of all lynchings and that in 90 percent of others law-enforcement officers “either condone or wink at the mob action.” The nonchalant look on Officer Derek Chauvin’s face — as, hand in pocket, for 8 minutes 46 seconds, he pressed his knee against the neck of a facedown black man begging for his life — reminds me of every callous white face captured in the grisly photos taken in the 1900s to mark the gleeful spectacle of the public killings of black men and women.

It devastates black people that all the other black deaths before George Floyd did not get us here. It devastates black people to recall all the excuses that have come before. That big black boy, Michael Brown, must have charged the weapon-carrying officer. Eric Garner should have stopped struggling. Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend had a weapon in her home and shouldn’t have shot at the people who, without a knock or an announcement, burst through her door. We’re not sure what Ahmaud Arbery was doing in that predominantly white neighborhood. Rayshard Brooks, who in the midst of nationwide protests against police violence was shot in the back twice by a police officer, just shouldn’t have resisted.

It should devastate us all that in 2020 it took a cellphone video broadcast across the globe of a black man dying from the oldest and most terrifying tool in the white-supremacist arsenal to make a vast majority of white Americans decide that, well, this might be enough.

We, now, have finally arrived at the point of this essay. Because when it comes to truly explaining racial injustice in this country, the table should never be set quickly: There is too much to know, and yet we aggressively choose not to know it.

No one can predict whether this uprising will lead to lasting change. History does not bode well. But there does seem to be a widespread acceptance of the most obvious action we could take toward equality in a nation built on the espoused ideals of inalienable, universal rights: pass reforms and laws that ensure that black people cannot be killed by armed agents of the state without consequence.

But on its own, this cannot bring justice to America. If we are truly at the precipice of a transformative moment, the most tragic of outcomes would be that the demand be too timid and the resolution too small. If we are indeed serious about creating a more just society, we must go much further than that. We must get to the root of it.

Fifty years since the bloody and brutally repressed protests and freedom struggles of black Americans brought about the end of legal discrimination in this country, so much of what makes black lives hard, what takes black lives earlier, what causes black Americans to be vulnerable to the type of surveillance and policing that killed Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, what steals opportunities, is the lack of wealth that has been a defining feature of black life since the end of slavery.

Wealth, not income, is the means to security in America. Wealth — assets and investments minus debt — is what enables you to buy homes in safer neighborhoods with better amenities and better-funded schools. It is what enables you to send your children to college without saddling them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and what provides you money to put a down payment on a house. It is what prevents family emergencies or unexpected job losses from turning into catastrophes that leave you homeless and destitute. It is what ensures what every parent wants — that your children will have fewer struggles than you did. Wealth is security and peace of mind. It’s not incidental that wealthier people are healthier and live longer. Wealth is, as a recent Yale study states, “the most consequential index of economic well-being” for most Americans. But wealth is not something people create solely by themselves; it is accumulated across generations.

While unchecked discrimination still plays a significant role in shunting opportunities for black Americans, it is white Americans’ centuries-long economic head start that most effectively maintains racial caste today. As soon as laws began to ban racial discrimination against black Americans, white Americans created so-called race-neutral means of maintaining political and economic power. For example, soon after the 15th Amendment granted black men the right to vote, white politicians in many states, understanding that recently freed black Americans were impoverished, implemented poll taxes. In other words, white Americans have long known that in a country where black people have been kept disproportionately poor and prevented from building wealth, rules and policies involving money can be nearly as effective for maintaining the color line as legal segregation. You do not have to have laws forcing segregated housing and schools if white Americans, using their generational wealth and higher incomes, can simply buy their way into expensive enclaves with exclusive public schools that are out of the price range of most black Americans.

It has worked with impressive efficiency. Today black Americans remain the most segregated group of people in America and are five times as likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods as white Americans. Not even high earnings inoculate black people against racialized disadvantage. Black families earning $75,000 or more a year live in poorer neighborhoods than white Americans earning less than $40,000 a year, research by John Logan, a Brown University sociologist, shows. According to another study, by the Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon and his colleagues, the average black family earning $100,000 a year lives in a neighborhood with an average annual income of $54,000. Black Americans with high incomes are still black: They face discrimination across American life. But it is because their families have not been able to build wealth that they are often unable to come up with a down payment to buy in more affluent neighborhoods, while white Americans with lower incomes often use familial wealth to do so.

The difference between the lived experience of black Americans and white Americans when it comes to wealth — along the entire spectrum of income from the poorest to the richest — can be described as nothing other than a chasm. According to research published this year by scholars at Duke University and Northwestern University that doesn’t even take into account the yet-unknown financial wreckage of Covid-19, the average black family with children holds just one cent of wealth for every dollar that the average white family with children holds.

As President Johnson, architect of the Great Society, explained in a 1965 speech titled “To Fulfill These Rights”: “Negro poverty is not white poverty. … These differences are not racial differences. They are solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality, past injustice and present prejudice. They are anguishing to observe. For the Negro they are a constant reminder of oppression. For the white they are a constant reminder of guilt. But they must be faced, and they must be dealt with, and they must be overcome; if we are ever to reach the time when the only difference between Negroes and whites is the color of their skin.”

We sometimes forget, and perhaps it is an intentional forgetting, that the racism we are fighting today was originally conjured to justify working unfree black people, often until death, to generate extravagant riches for European colonial powers, the white planter class and all the ancillary white people from Midwestern farmers to bankers to sailors to textile workers, who earned their living and built their wealth from free black labor and the products that labor produced. The prosperity of this country is inextricably linked with the forced labor of the ancestors of 40 million black Americans for whom these marches are now occurring, just as it is linked to the stolen land of the country’s indigenous people. Though our high school history books seldom make this plain: Slavery and the 100-year period of racial apartheid and racial terrorism known as Jim Crow were, above all else, systems of economic exploitation. To borrow from Ta-Nehisi Coates’s phrasing, racism is the child of economic profiteering, not the father.

Numerous legal efforts to strip black people of their humanity existed to justify the extraction of profit. Beginning in the 1660s, white officials ensured that all children born to enslaved women would also be enslaved and belong not to their mothers but to the white men who owned their mothers. They passed laws dictating that the child’s status would follow that of the mother not the father, upending European norms and guaranteeing that the children of enslaved women who were sexually assaulted by white men would be born enslaved and not free. It meant that profit for white people could be made from black women’s wombs. Laws determining that enslaved people, just like animals, had no recognized kinship ties ensured that human beings could be bought and sold at will to pay debts, buy more acres or save storied universities like Georgetown from closing. Laws barred enslaved people from making wills or owning property, distinguishing black people in America from every other group on these shores and assuring that everything of value black people managed to accrue would add to the wealth of those who enslaved them. At the time of the Civil War, the value of the enslaved human beings held as property added up to more than all of this nations’ railroads and factories combined. And yet, enslaved people saw not a dime of this wealth. They owned nothing and were owed nothing from all that had been built from their toil.

Slavery’s demise provided this nation the chance for redemption. Out of the ashes of sectarian strife, we could have birthed a new country, one that recognized the humanity and natural rights of those who helped forge this country, one that attempted to atone and provide redress for the unspeakable atrocities committed against black people in the name of profit. We could have finally, 100 years after the Revolution, embraced its founding ideals.

And, oh so briefly, during the period known as Reconstruction, we moved toward that goal. The historian Eric Foner refers to these 12 years after the Civil War as this nation’s second founding, because it is here that America began to redeem the grave sin of slavery. Congress passed amendments abolishing human bondage, enshrining equal protection before the law in the Constitution and guaranteeing black men the right to vote. This nation witnessed its first period of biracial governance as the formerly enslaved were elected to public offices at all levels of government. For a fleeting moment, a few white men listened to the pleas of black people who had fought for the Union and helped deliver its victory. Land in this country has always meant wealth and, more important, independence. Millions of black people, liberated with not a cent to their name, desperately wanted property so they could work, support themselves and be left alone. Black people implored federal officials to take the land confiscated from enslavers who had taken up arms against their own country and grant it to those who worked it for generations. They were asking to, as the historian Robin D.G. Kelley puts it, “inherit the earth they had turned into wealth for idle white people.”

In January 1865, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Order 15, providing for the distribution of hundreds of thousands of acres of former Confederate land issued in 40-acre tracts to newly freed people along coastal South Carolina and Georgia. But just four months later, in April, Lincoln was assassinated. Andrew Johnson, the racist, pro-Southern vice president who took over, immediately reneged upon this promise of 40 acres, overturning Sherman’s order. Most white Americans felt that black Americans should be grateful for their freedom, that the bloody Civil War had absolved any debt. The government confiscated the land from the few formerly enslaved families who had started to eke out a life away from the white whip and gave it back to the traitors. And with that, the only real effort this nation ever made to compensate black Americans for 250 years of chattel slavery ended.

Freed people, during and after slavery, tried again and again to compel the government to provide restitution for slavery, to provide at the very least a pension for those who spent their entire lives working for no pay. They filed lawsuits. They organized to lobby politicians. And every effort failed. To this day, the only Americans who have ever received government restitution for slavery were white enslavers in Washington, D.C., who were compensated for their loss of human property.

The way we are taught this in school, Lincoln “freed the slaves,” and then the nearly four million people who the day before had been treated as property suddenly enjoyed the privileges of being Americans like everyone else. We are not prodded to contemplate what it means to achieve freedom without a home to live in, without food to eat, a bed to sleep on, clothes for your children or money to buy any of it. Narratives collected of formerly enslaved people during the Federal Writers’ Project of the 1930s reveal the horrors of massive starvation, of “liberated” black people seeking shelter in burned-out buildings and scrounging for food in decaying fields before eventually succumbing to the heartbreak of returning to bend over in the fields of their former enslavers, as sharecroppers, just so they would not die. “With the advent of emancipation,” writes the historian Keri Leigh Merritt, “blacks became the only race in the U.S. ever to start out, as an entire people, with close to zero capital.”

In 1881, Frederick Douglass, surveying the utter privation in which the federal government left the formerly enslaved, wrote: “When the Hebrews were emancipated, they were told to take spoil from the Egyptians. When the serfs of Russia were emancipated, they were given three acres of ground upon which they could live and make a living. But not so when our slaves were emancipated. They were sent away empty-handed, without money, without friends and without a foot of land on which they could live and make a living. Old and young, sick and well, were turned loose to the naked sky, naked to their enemies.”

Just after the federal government decided that black people were undeserving of restitution, it began bestowing millions of acres in the West to white Americans under the Homestead Act, while also enticing white foreigners to immigrate with the offer of free land. From 1868 to 1934, the federal government gave away 246 million acres in 160-acre tracts, nearly 10 percent of all the land in the nation, to more than 1.5 million white families, native-born and foreign. As Merritt points out, some 46 million American adults today, nearly 20 percent of all American adults, descend from those homesteaders. “If that many white Americans can trace their legacy of wealth and property ownership to a single entitlement program,” Merritt writes, “then the perpetuation of black poverty must also be linked to national policy.”

The federal government turned its back on its financial obligations to four million newly liberated people, and then it left them without protection as well, as white rule was reinstated across the South starting in the 1880s. Federal troops pulled out of the South, and white Southerners overthrew biracial governance using violence, coups and election fraud.

The campaigns of white terror that marked the period after Reconstruction, known as Redemption, once again guaranteed an exploitable, dependent labor force for the white South. Most black Southerners had no desire to work on the same forced-labor camps where they had just been enslaved. But white Southerners passed state laws that made it a crime if they didn’t sign labor contracts with white landowners or changed employers without permission or sold cotton after sunset, and then as punishment for these “crimes,” black people were forcibly leased out to companies and individuals. Through sharecropping and convict leasing, black people were compelled back into quasi slavery. This arrangement ensured that once-devasted towns like Greenwood, Miss., were again able to call themselves the cotton capitals of the world, and companies like United States Steel secured a steady supply of unfree black laborers who could be worked to death, in what Douglass A. Blackmon, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, calls “slavery by another name.”

Yet black Americans persisted, and despite the odds, some managed to acquire land, start businesses and build schools for their children. But it was the most prosperous black people and communities that elicited the most vicious response. Lynchings, massacres and generalized racial terrorism were regularly deployed against black people who had bought land, opened schools, built thriving communities, tried to organize sharecroppers’ unions or opened their own businesses, depriving white owners of economic monopolies and the opportunity to cheat black buyers.

At least 6,500 black people were lynched from the end of the Civil War to 1950, an average of nearly two a week for nine decades. Nearly five black people, on average, have been killed a week by law enforcement since 2015.

The scale of the destruction during the 1900s is incalculable. Black farms were stolen, shops burned to the ground. Entire prosperous black neighborhoods and communities were razed by white mobs from Florida to North Carolina to Atlanta to Arkansas. One of the most infamous of these, and yet still widely unknown among white Americans, occurred in Tulsa, Okla., when gangs of white men, armed with guns supplied by public officials, destroyed a black district so successful that it was known as Black Wall Street. They burned more than 1,200 homes and businesses, including a department store, a library and a hospital, and killed hundreds who it is believed were buried in mass graves. In 2001, a commission on the massacre recommended that the state pay financial restitution for the victims, but the State Legislature refused. And this is the place that in the midst of weeks of protests crying out for black lives to matter, Donald Trump, nearly 100 years later, chose to restart his campaign rallies.

Even black Americans who did not experience theft and violence were continuously deprived of the ability to build wealth. They were denied entry into labor unions and union jobs that ensured middle-class wages. North and South, racist hiring laws and policies forced them into service jobs, even when they earned college degrees. They were legally relegated into segregated, substandard neighborhoods and segregated, substandard schools that made it impossible to compete economically even had they not faced rampant discrimination in the job market. In the South, for most of the period after the Civil War until the 1960s, nearly all the black people who wanted to earn professional degrees — law, medical and master’s degrees — had to leave the region to do so even as white immigrants attended state colleges in the former Confederacy that black American tax dollars helped pay for.

As part of the New Deal programs, the federal government created redlining maps, marking neighborhoods where black people lived in red ink to denote that they were uninsurable. As a result, 98 percent of the loans the Federal Housing Administration insured from 1934 to 1962 went to white Americans, locking nearly all black Americans out of the government program credited with building the modern (white) middle class.

“At the very moment a wide array of public policies was providing most white Americans with valuable tools to advance their social welfare — ensure their old age, get good jobs, acquire economic security, build assets and gain middle-class status — most black Americans were left behind or left out,” the historian Ira Katznelson writes in his book, “When Affirmative Action Was White.” “The federal government … functioned as a commanding instrument of white privilege.”

In other words, while black Americans were being systematically, generationally deprived of the ability to build wealth, while also being robbed of the little they had managed to gain, white Americans were not only free to earn money and accumulate wealth with exclusive access to the best jobs, best schools, best credit terms, but they were also getting substantial government help in doing so.

The civil rights movement ostensibly ended white advantage by law. And in the gauzy way white Americans tend to view history, particularly the history of racial inequality, the end of legal discrimination, after 350 years, is all that was required to vanquish this dark history and its effects. Changing the laws, too many Americans have believed, marked the end of the obligation. But civil rights laws passed in the 1960s merely guaranteed black people rights they should have always had. They dictated that from that day forward, the government would no longer sanction legal racial discrimination. But these laws did not correct the harm nor restore what was lost.

Brown v. Board of Education did not end segregated and unequal schools; it just ended segregation in the law. It took court orders and, at times, federal troops to see any real integration. Nevertheless, more than six decades after the nation’s highest court proclaimed school segregation unconstitutional, black children remain as segregated from white kids as they were in the early 1970s. There has never been a point in American history where even half the black children in this country have attended a majority-white school.

Making school segregation illegal did nothing to repay black families for the theft of their educations or make up for generations of black Americans, many of them still living, who could never go to college because white officials believed that only white students needed a high school education and so refused to operate high schools for black children. As late as the 1930s, most communities in the South, where the vast majority of black Americans lived, failed to provide a single public high school for black children, according to “The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935,” by the historian James D. Anderson. Heavily black Richmond County in Georgia, for instance, did not provide a four-year black high school from 1897 to 1945.

The Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination in housing, but it did not reset real estate values so that homes in redlined black neighborhoods whose prices were artificially deflated would be valued the same as identical homes in white neighborhoods, which had been artificially inflated. It did not provide restitution for generations of black homeowners forced into predatory loans because they had been locked out of the prime credit market. It did not repay every black soldier who returned from World War II to find that he could not use his G.I. Bill to buy a home for his family in any of the new whites-only suburbs subsidized by the same government he fought for. It did not break up the still-entrenched housing segregation that took decades of government and private policy to create. Lay those redlining maps over almost any city in America with a significant black population, and you will see that the government-sanctioned segregation patterns remain stubbornly intact and that those same communities bore the brunt of the predatory lending and foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s that stole years of black homeownership and wealth gains.

Making employment discrimination illegal did not come with a check for black Americans to compensate for all the high-paying jobs they were legally barred from, for the promotions they never got solely because of their race, for the income and opportunities lost to the centuries of discrimination. Nor did these laws end ongoing discrimination any more than speed limits without enforcement stop people from driving too fast. These laws opened up opportunities for limited numbers of black Americans while largely leaving centuries of meticulously orchestrated inequities soundly in place, but now with the sheen of colorblind magnanimity.

The inclination to bandage over and move on is a definitive American feature when it comes to anti-black racism and its social and material effects. A joint 2019 study by faculty members at Yale University’s School of Management, Department of Psychology and Institute for Social and Policy Studies describes this phenomenon this way: “A firm belief in our nation’s commitment to racial egalitarianism is part of the collective consciousness of the United States of America. … We have a strong and persistent belief that our national disgrace of racial oppression has been overcome, albeit through struggle, and that racial equality has largely been achieved.” The authors point out how white Americans love to play up moments of racial progress like the Emancipation Proclamation, Brown v. Board of Education and the election of Barack Obama, while playing down or ignoring lynching, racial apartheid or the 1985 bombing of a black neighborhood in Philadelphia. “When it comes to race relations in the United States … most Americans hold an unyielding belief in a specific, optimistic narrative regarding racial progress that is robust to counterexamples: that society has come a very long way already and is moving rapidly, perhaps naturally toward full racial equality.”

This remarkable imperviousness to facts when it comes to white advantage and architected black disadvantage is what emboldens some white Americans to quote the passage from Martin Luther King’s 1963 “I Have A Dream” speech about being judged by the content of your character and not by the color of your skin. It’s often used as a cudgel against calls for race-specific remedies for black Americans — while ignoring the part of that same speech where King says black people have marched on the capital to cash “a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’”

King has been evoked continuously during this season of protests, sometimes to defend those who looted and torched buildings, sometimes to condemn them. But in this time of foment, there has been an astounding silence around his most radical demands. The seldom-quoted King is the one who said that the true battle for equality, the actualization of justice, required economic repair.

After watching Northern cities explode even as his movement’s efforts to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act came to fruition, King gave a speech in 1967 in Atlanta before the Hungry Club Forum, a secret gathering of white politicians and civil rights leaders.

King said: “For well now 12 years, the struggle was basically a struggle to end legal segregation. In a sense it was a struggle for decency. It was a struggle to get rid of all of the humiliation and the syndrome of depravation surrounding the system of legal segregation. And I need not remind you that those were glorious days. … It is now a struggle for genuine equality on all levels, and this will be a much more difficult struggle. You see, the gains in the first period, or the first era of struggle, were obtained from the power structure at bargain rates; it didn’t cost the nation anything to integrate lunch counters. It didn’t cost the nation anything to integrate hotels and motels. It didn’t cost the nation a penny to guarantee the right to vote. Now we are in a period where it will cost the nation billions of dollars to get rid of poverty, to get rid of slums, to make quality integrated education a reality. This is where we are now. Now we’re going to lose some friends in this period. The allies who were with us in Selma will not all stay with us during this period. We’ve got to understand what is happening. Now they often call this the white backlash. … It’s just a new name for an old phenomenon. The fact is that there has never been any single, solid, determined commitment on the part of the vast majority of white Americans to genuine equality for Negroes.”

A year later, in March 1968, just a month before his assassination, in a speech to striking, impoverished black sanitation workers in Memphis, King said: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t have enough money to buy a hamburger?”

As we focus on police violence, we cannot ignore an even starker indication of our societal failures: Racial income disparities today look no different than they did the decade before King’s March on Washington. In 1950, according to a forthcoming study by the economists Moritz Schularick, Moritz Kuhn and Ulrike Steins in The Journal of Political Economy, black median household income was about half that of white Americans, and today it remains so. More critical, the racial wealth gap is about the same as it was in the 1950s as well. The typical black household today is poorer than 80 percent of white households. “No progress has been made over the past 70 years in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households,” according to the study.

And yet most Americans are in an almost pathological denial about the depth of black financial struggle. That 2019 Yale University study, called “The Misperception of Racial Economic Inequality,” found that Americans believe that black households hold $90 in wealth for every $100 held by white households. The actual amount is $10.

About 97 percent of study participants overestimated black-white wealth equality, and most assumed that highly educated, high-income black households were the most likely to achieve economic parity with white counterparts. That is also wrong. The magnitude of the wealth gap only widens as black people earn more income.

“These data suggest that Americans are largely unaware of the striking persistence of racial economic inequality in the United States,” the study’s authors write. Americans, they write, tend to explain away or justify persistent racial inequality by ignoring the “tailwinds that have contributed to their economic success while justifying inequalities of wealth and poverty by invoking the role of individuals’ traits and skills as explanations for these disparities.” They use the exceptional examples of very successful black people to prove that systemic racism does not hold black Americans back and point to the large numbers of impoverished black people as evidence that black people are largely responsible for their own struggles.

In 2018, Duke University’s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity and the Insight Center for Community Economic Development published a report called “What We Get Wrong About Closing the Racial Wealth Gap” that examined the common misperceptions about the causes of the racial wealth gap and presented data and social-science research that refutes them all.

The study shows that the racial wealth gap is not about poverty. Poor white families earning less than $27,000 a year hold nearly the same amount of wealth as black families earning between $48,000 and $76,000 annually. It’s not because of black spending habits. Black Americans have lower incomes over all but save at a slightly higher rate than white Americans with similar incomes. It’s not that black people need to value education more. Black parents, when controlling for household type and socioeconomic status, actually offer more financial support for their children’s higher education than white parents do, according to the study. And some studies have shown that black youths, when compared with white youths whose parents have similar incomes and education levels, are actually more likely to go to college and earn additional credentials.

But probably most astounding to many Americans is that college simply does not pay off for black Americans the way it does for other groups. Black college graduates are about as likely to be unemployed as white Americans with a high school diploma, and black Americans with a college education hold less wealth than white Americans who have not even completed high school. Further, because black families hold almost no wealth to begin with, black students are the most likely to borrow money to pay for college and then to borrow more. That debt, in turn, means that black students cannot start saving immediately upon graduation like their less-debt-burdened peers.

It’s not a lack of homeownership. While it’s true that black Americans have the lowest homeownership rates in the nation, simply owning a home is not the same asset that it is for white Americans. Black Americans get higher mortgage rates even with equal credit worthiness, and homes in black neighborhoods do not appreciate at the same rate as those in white areas, because housing prices are still driven by the racial makeup of communities. As the Duke University economist William Darity Jr., the study’s lead author, points out, the ability to purchase a home in the first place is seldom a result of just the hard work and frugality of the buyer. “It’s actually parental and grandparental wealth that facilitates the acquisition of a home.”

It’s not because a majority of black families are led by a single mother. White single women with children hold the same amount of wealth as single black women with no children, and the typical white single parent has twice the wealth of the typical two-parent black family.

To summarize, none of the actions we are told black people must take if they want to “lift themselves” out of poverty and gain financial stability — not marrying, not getting educated, not saving more, not owning a home — can mitigate 400 years of racialized plundering. Wealth begets wealth, and white Americans have had centuries of government assistance to accumulate wealth, while the government has for the vast history of this country worked against black Americans doing the same.

“The cause of the gap must be found in the structural characteristics of the American economy, heavily infused at every point with both an inheritance of racism and the ongoing authority of white supremacy,” the authors of the Duke study write. “There are no actions that black Americans can take unilaterally that will have much of an effect on reducing the wealth gap. For the gap to be closed, America must undergo a vast social transformation produced by the adoption of bold national policies.”

At the center of those policies must be reparations. “The process of creating the racial wealth chasm begins with the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40 acres they were promised,” Darity told me. “So the restitution has never been given, and it’s 155 years overdue.”

Darity has been studying and advocating reparations for 30 years, and this spring he and his partner, A. Kirsten Mullen, published the book “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the 21st Century.” Both history and road map, the book answers the questions about who should receive reparations and how a program would work. I will not spend much time on that here, except to make these few points. Reparations are not about punishing white Americans, and white Americans are not the ones who would pay for them. It does not matter if your ancestors engaged in slavery or if you just immigrated here two weeks ago. Reparations are a societal obligation in a nation where our Constitution sanctioned slavery, Congress passed laws protecting it and our federal government initiated, condoned and practiced legal racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans until half a century ago. And so it is the federal government that pays.

Reparations would go to any person who has documentation that he or she identified as a black person for at least 10 years before the beginning of any reparations process and can trace at least one ancestor back to American slavery. Reparations should include a commitment to vigorously enforcing existing civil rights prohibitions against housing, educational and employment discrimination, as well as targeted investments in government-constructed segregated black communities and the segregated schools that serve a disproportionate number of black children. But critically, reparations must include individual cash payments to descendants of the enslaved in order to close the wealth gap.

The technical details, frankly, are the easier part. The real obstacle, the obstacle that we have never overcome, is garnering the political will — convincing enough Americans that the centuries-long forced economic disadvantage of black Americans should be remedied, that restitution is owed to people who have never had an equal chance to take advantage of the bounty they played such a significant part in creating.

This country can be remarkably generous. Each year Congress allocates money — this year $5 million — to help support Holocaust survivors living in America. In backing the funding measure, Representative Richard E. Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in 2018 that this country has a “responsibility to support the surviving men and women of the Holocaust and their families.” And he is right. It is the moral thing to do. And yet Congress has refused for three decades to pass H.R. 40, a bill to simply study the issue of reparations. Its drafter, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat and descendant of enslaved Americans, died in 2019 — during the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans enslaved in Virginia — without the bill ever making it out of committee.

There are living victims of racial apartheid and terrorism born in this country, including civil rights activists who lost their homes and jobs fighting to make this country a democracy, who have never received any sort of restitution for what they endured. Soon, like their enslaved ancestors, they will all be dead, too, and then we’ll hear the worn excuse that this country owes no reparations because none of the victims are still alive. Darity and Mullen call this the “delay until death” tactic. Procrastination, they say, does not erase what is owed.

The coronavirus pandemic has dispatched the familiar lament that even if it is the right thing to do, this nation simply cannot afford to make restitution to the 40 million descendants of American slavery. It took Congress just a matter of weeks to pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill to help families and businesses struggling from the Covid-19 shutdowns. When, then, will this nation pass a stimulus package to finally respond to the singularity of black suffering?

Colossal societal ruptures have been the only things potent enough to birth transformative racial change in this country, and perhaps a viral pandemic colliding with our nation’s 400-year racial one has forced that type of rupture today. Maybe it had to be this way; this deep and collective suffering was necessary for white Americans to feel enough of the pain that black Americans have always known to tilt the scale.

With Covid-19, black Americans face a financial catastrophe unlike any in nearly a century. Black Americans had already lost the largest share of their wealth of all racial groups as a result of the last recession and have struggled the most to recover. They are the only racial group whose household median income is less than it was in 2000. Today already more than half of black adults are out of work. Black businesses are withering. Their owners were almost completely shut out of the federal paycheck-protection program — just 12 percent of black and Latino business owners who applied for the small-business loans received the full amounts they requested, according to a Global Strategy Group survey last month. Nearly half the respondents said they would most likely shutter permanently within six months. Black children are expected to lose 10 months’ worth of academic gains because of school closures, more than any other group, and yet they attend the schools with the least resources already, schools that will have even fewer resources as states slash spending to make up for budget shortfalls. One in five black homeowners and one in four renters have missed at least one home payment since the shutdowns began — the highest of all racial groups.

The pandemic, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, a scholar of social movements and racial inequality at Princeton University, told me, “has pulled what is hidden and buried on the bottom to the surface so that it can’t actually be ignored. It is a radicalizing factor because conditions that have been so dire, now combined with revolts in the street, might lead one to believe that not only is the society unraveling, but it might cause you to question what foundation it was built upon in the first place.”

Race-neutral policies simply will not address the depth of disadvantage faced by people this country once believed were chattel. Financial restitution cannot end racism, of course, but it can certainly mitigate racism’s most devastating effects. If we do nothing, black Americans may never recover from this pandemic, and they will certainly never know the equality the nation has promised.

So we are left with a choice. Will this moment only feel different? Or will it actually be different?

If black lives are to truly matter in America, this nation must move beyond slogans and symbolism. Citizens don’t inherit just the glory of their nation, but its wrongs too. A truly great country does not ignore or excuse its sins. It confronts them and then works to make them right. If we are to be redeemed, if we are to live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded, we must do what is just.

It is time for this country to pay its debt. It is time for reparations.

But the two autopsy reports differed on exactly how the man died .
Dr. Allecia Wilson , one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy , said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation .
But the report released later Monday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner 's office said Floyd died of `` cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual , restraint and neck compression . '' The manner of death was ruled homicide , but the office noted that `` is not a legal determination of culpability or intent . '' A preliminary autopsy report cited earlier by prosecutors said the county medical examiner 's review `` revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation . ''
Floyd 's death has led to widespread outrage , protests and unrest across the nation . The Minneapolis officer seen kneeling on Floyd 's neck , Derek Chauvin , was charged last week with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter .
The independent autopsy was conducted by Wilson and Dr. Michael Baden . Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City , and was also hired in 2014 to conduct the autopsy of Eric Garner , a black man who died when an NYPD officer used a banned chokehold during his arrest . Both Garner and Floyd pleaded with officers that they could n't breathe before their deaths seen on disturbing videos , and `` I ca n't breathe '' has become a rallying cry among those protesting police brutality .
George Floyd , left , and former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin , who is charged with third-degree murder for Floyd 's death .
Baden said Floyd died as a result of compression on his neck and back from the officer , which interfered with blood flow and his breathing .
`` George died because he needed a breath , '' said Ben Crump , a lawyer representing Floyd 's family . `` He needed a breath of air . ''
The Hennepin County medical examiner 's office , however , said Floyd experienced cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by the officer . The county autopsy said Floyd had `` other significant conditions '' including `` arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease ; fentanyl intoxication ; [ and ] recent methamphetamine use . '' The office had not previously released the findings pending toxicology reports .
But Baden said the further testing would n't reveal evidence of compressive pressure on Floyd 's neck and back since the pressure would have been released when it was no longer applied . He said large areas of scrapes and abrasions on Floyd 's face indicated the force that was used to press him into the ground .
Baden also said that he could find no underlying conditions that contributed to Floyd 's death , saying he was in good health . In a criminal complaint , Hennepin County prosecutors said Chauvin `` had his knee on Mr. Floyd 's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds . Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was `` non-responsive . '' Crump said Floyd 's death was the result of that sustained pressure to his neck and the pressure on Floyd 's back from other officers holding him down .
`` What those officers did , as we have seen on the video , is his cause of death — not some underlying , unknown health condition , '' Crump said . `` George Floyd was a healthy young man . ''
Floyd family attorney says charge against officer should be upgraded to first-degree murder
Crump said the family understands the `` righteous anger '' of protesters and said they support the people who want to work towards change , but he called the violence `` unacceptable . '' He encouraged the community to `` take a breath for justice , take a breath for peace , take a breath for our country , but more importantly , take a breath for George , since he did n't get the opportunity to take a breath . ''
Another lawyer representing Floyd 's family , Antonio Romanucci , said the three other officers involved are also criminally responsible for Floyd 's death . All have been fired , but none of the others have been charged . He called those officers `` shameless '' and said they had every opportunity to prevent Floyd 's death , knowing that restricting his airway could kill him . The family has called for those officers to be charged , and for Chauvin to face first-degree — rather than third-degree — murder charges .
Romanucci also blasted the Minneapolis police department for what he described as a failure to properly train officers about chokeholds and restraint .
`` This was a brutal and public display of an eight-minute prolonged death , '' Romanucci said . `` This was the lowest level of human respect and dignity that any community should ever have to endure . What this really was was the weight of the Minneapolis police department on George 's neck . ''

race_and_racism,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-tweets-racist-historian-explains-why/,What makes Trump's tweets racist? A historian explains,,Jessica Kegu,"When President Trump tweeted on Sunday that `` 'Progressive ' Democratic Congresswomen '' — an apparent reference to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Rashida Tlaib , Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley , who are all women of color — should `` go back '' to their countries , the backlash was swift . It also sparked another conversation : What makes something racist ?
Ibram Kendi , a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University , joined `` CBS This Morning '' to address that question from a historical perspective and discuss whether racist actions or words make someone a racist .
Kendi explained the important historical context behind telling a person of color to go back to where they came from .
`` In the 19th century , there were many , many reformers , racial reformers who thought the way to solve the race problem , the Negro problem , was to essentially send back all free blacks [ to Africa ] . And that started with Thomas Jefferson , his Notes to the State of Virginia which was published in 1787 , and went up to Abraham Lincoln , '' Kendi said .
He also pointed out that this language is aimed almost exclusively at people of color — because America is assumed to be a place for white people . `` So where would they go back to ? But people of color , it 's assumed that this is not their country , '' Kendi said .
A common refrain among Trump supporters , whenever he sets off a furor with an early-morning tweetstorm , is that he 's just inappropriate — not racist . There 's a difference , they say . And Mr. Trump asserted in a tweet , `` I do n't have a Racist bone in my body ! ''
`` First , I 'd say there 's no such thing as not racist . There 's racist and anti-racist , '' Kendi said . `` Racist ideas suggest that there 's something wrong or right , superior or inferior about a particular group . It suggests there 's something inherently normal about white Americans , that Americans are white and whites are Americans . And his idea suggests that somehow people of color are not American , and that 's deeply racist . ''
Kendi also took issue with the argument that because Mr. Trump did n't specifically call out any race of people , his comments ca n't be considered racist .
`` Poll taxes , grandfather clauses — these were voting suppression bills widely considered by Americans to be racist . There was no racial language in them . You do n't have to have racial language in an idea or even in a policy for it to be racist . It 's about what its outcome , are you suggesting that there 's something wrong with a particular group ? Is it creating inequity ? That 's the true measure of whether something is racist . ''

One of the congresswomen apparently targeted by the president 's tweets , Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , came under fire earlier this year for comments deemed by some as anti-Semitic ; she later apologized for the remarks . Kendi , though , said there 's a fundamental difference between Omar 's and Trump 's comments .
`` She was very specific in criticizing the policies of a country . In this case the country was Israel . Trump has specifically criticized racial groups of people , '' he said . `` When he said that Mexicans are rapists . When he said that a trait of blacks is laziness . This is a condemnation of a racial group of people . That is effectively racism . When we criticize a country 's policies , that is not — when you criticize Israeli policies , that 's not anti-Semitic . When you say there 's something wrong with Jews , that is . I have n't heard her say that . ''
And on the question of whether a racist comment can make a racist man , Kendi was blunt : `` If you say things that are racist , you 're racist .

race_and_racism,Snopes,1,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blm-flyer-enemy-of-people/,Does a BLM Flyer Label White People the ‘Enemy’?,,Dan Evon,"In the spring of 2020 , as protests against racial injustice and police brutality swept across the U.S. following the death of a Black man in police custody , online trolls started to spread racist propaganda in an attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement . Generally speaking , these posts made inflammatory and violent claims , then falsely attributed them to BLM .
For example , one such hoax held that BLM protesters were going to “ assassinate white families . ”
In June 2020 , ███ came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men , women , and children as “ the enemy ” :
But this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter . This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions .

Generally speaking, these posts made inflammatory and violent claims, then falsely attributed them to BLM.

For example, one such hoax held that BLM protesters were going to “assassinate white families.”

In June 2020, Snopes came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men, women, and children as “the enemy”:

But this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter. This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions.

But minutes after my news conference, the Republican National Committee clipped 27 seconds of my speech and added a false caption that said I had just called for getting rid of the entire U.S. economy and government. Instantly, Donald Trump Jr. and right-wing “media outlets” were amplifying the false claim. That evening, Tucker Carlson dedicated a segment of his Fox News program to attacking me and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), another prominent woman of color, under the banner, “We Have to Fight to Preserve Our Nation & Heritage.” My congressional office and social media feeds were instantly flooded with hate speech, calls for deportation and, as is so often the case, death threats.

It was something I’ve become accustomed to as a black Muslim woman in public life. Donald Trump explicitly called all Somali immigrants a “disaster” for Minnesota at a 2016 campaign rally in my state.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

George Zimmerman swoops back into the spotlight, this time saving the day. He and another good Samaritan arrived on the scene of an accident just in time to help rescue two adults and two children trapped inside their burning vehicle that had turned over.

My very first thought was, “OK, how can the media turn this into an issue about race?”

Well, it didn’t take long. Within hours of the news breaking, The Great White Media had tracked down the single-most important detail of this story about life and death.

“Crash Victims Were White,” declared the headline on the TMZ website. Somehow, it mattered to The Great White Media that the victims were not black.

Why, you ask? Well, it is because The Great White Media is absolutely obsessed with race. That is partly because they themselves are an almost exclusively white club and the strangeness of other races confuses them and intrigues them. Also, they struggle with anything more complex than that which is skin deep.

Take the tragic shooting death of Trayvon Martin at the hands of Mr. Zimmerman. It is a heart-breaking story. But that is not enough. It must be twisted into a story about a white man’s gun violence against a profiled black teen. That is why the media had to declare that Mr. Zimmerman, whose mother is Hispanic, is actually a “white Hispanic.”

Nothing entertains The Great White Media like the blood of a black teen shed at the hands of a “white” man.

That is why they were so delighted to see their “white” villain re-emerge from hiding. Even better, Mr. Zimmerman was reprising his role as “wannabe cop” and became a “wannabe EMT.”

Nothing brought more mockery and scorn from The Great White Media than their notion that Mr. Zimmerman was a “wannabe cop” who joined the neighborhood patrol and kept close tabs on things going on around his house and those of his neighbors.

Anywhere in America, this would be called a “good neighbor.” To The Great White Media, this is called a “racist, profiling, hate-filled white Hispanic.” Dialing 911 is the most heroic thing they would ever do.

Even level-headed liberals lamented that Mr. Zimmerman was somehow thrust to the level of hero after the tragic struggle in which an unarmed, black teen was killed.

Mr. Zimmerman was not elevated to hero for shooting a kid. Every decent parent in America agonized over that. What was heroic was that before he ever encountered Trayvon in the darkness, Mr. Zimmerman voluntarily patrolled his neighborhood in an effort to keep his family and neighbors safe from crime. There are few higher callings than that.

It is the same high calling that spurs Americans to stop when they see a family trapped in a vehicle, overturned and in flames, and race into danger to help save two children and two adults.

We are reminded this week that America is not, thank God, an aristocracy. We are a nation of Samaritans — all of us lowly and scorned in some kind of way. But so often, our hearts are good and we seek to help our fellow man.

Except for The Great White Media. They are obsessed with race and they would rather call 911 and sit back to watch you burn in your overturned vehicle.

Opinion columnist

Look around. The statues are falling.

Not on their own accord, of course. Statues of Confederate military figures are being toppled by protesters outraged by racial injustice and the death of George Floyd, while some states and cities are removing the monuments on their own.

In recent days, the statue of Confederate Gen. Albert Pike was destroyed by demonstrators in Washington, D.C. and protesters in Richmond, Virginia, knocked down a statue of Confederacy President Jefferson Davis. The state of Kentucky announced it would remove its own statue of Davis from the Capitol and the city of Houston decided to remove all Confederate statues from its parks. In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper had two monuments removed from the State Capitol in the name of public safety. Similar scenes are playing out across America.

On one side, we have Americans outraged that their communities would still honor those who fought to preserve slavery during the Civil War. While supporters of the Confederate monuments often talk of heritage and history. President Trump has backed them with a promised executive order threatening federal prosecution for anyone who topples such a statue.

We must understand the significance of statues

Often missing from the public debate, though, is determining what these statues actually convey. Statues, like paintings and illustrations, are art, protected under the First Amendment because they express ideas.

We all know the messages conveyed by the Statue of Liberty, Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall and Lincoln Memorial. So, what messages do these celebrations of the Confederate Army convey? It depends in part on when they were built.

Construction of the first Confederate memorial began in 1866, one year after the Civil War ended. The message would have been pretty clear, mourning the loss of fathers, sons and brothers in the Civil War.

But what do we make of the boom in Confederate monuments 25 to 35 years later, when legislatures throughout the South passed Jim Crow laws to limit the rights of Black Americans? Or, the spike in Confederate statues during the height of the civil rights movement in the ’50s and ’60s?

A fresh start:Renaming bases and removing statues that honor racist leaders will help America begin anew

These weren’t cyclical flowerings of nostalgia for the Confederacy. These were endorsements of a time and culture in which Blacks were enslaved.

In the Southern Poverty Law Center’s view, “ the argument that the Confederate flag and other displays represent ‘heritage, not hate’ ignores the near-universal heritage of African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved by the millions in the South. It trivializes their pain, their history and their concerns about racism — whether it’s the racism of the past or that of today.”

A change in thought should also be a change in commemoration

Too often we view statues as permanent, perhaps influenced by the size and weight of these commemorative objects. They stay, sometimes due to inertia, long after the initial decision to erect them.

Monuments around the world come down when regimes change. You may recall the toppling of Saddam Hussein statutes in Iraq in 2003. Why shouldn’t statues come down when a society’s values change?

You might even say that removing monuments like these are part of a great American tradition.

Why do protesters want these Confederate statues taken down? For one, they honor men who went to war against the United States. They also represent subjugation of an entire people and the failure to protect the rights of all.

In 1776, days after America declared its independence from what it saw as an oppressive regime, the rebels of New York quickly toppled the statue of King George III.

At war with the United States? Check.

Subjugating a population? Yes.

Failing to recognize God-given rights? Absolutely.

Those who toppled the king’s statue had their own message. The world had changed forever.

That said, the real test of America’s values today is whether we can muster the political will to remove these offensive statutes through a peaceful process. Real change doesn’t come from the brute force of knocking down a statue. There are a lot of people who should be heard from before a community — and not a handful of protestors — decides that George Washington or Ulysses S. Grant aren’t worthy of our respect because they owned slaves.

Don't stick to the status quo:Pandemic and police killings reveal brutal status quo. We can fix this. Why won't we?

When legislators and government bodies refuse to remove monuments to rebel soldiers, they pretend it's an object or decoration that simply reflects the past. They're not acknowledging that these were in fact billboards for racism in the 20th century.

By keeping those monuments up in 2020 despite the pain it clearly causes many Americans, those in power are reinforcing the inherent messages of those statues. Let’s not kid ourselves about what was being said.

What’s happening

Black Lives Matter protests that started as a response to the police killing of George Floyd have sparked a much larger conversation about racism in America. One part of the discussion has focused on historical monuments that dot the landscape across the country and whether they should remain in place or be removed.

Recent weeks have seen the revival of an ongoing debate over symbols of the Confederacy. In several cities across the country, statues of Confederate figures have been taken down. Some were removed by local governments. Others were torn down by protesters. There have also been efforts to ban the Confederate flag and rename military bases named after Confederate generals.

It’s not only icons of the Civil War that are being targeted. Statues of some of the most important figures in American history have also been singled out. Protesters in Portland, Ore., tore down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Monuments to Christopher Columbus have been defaced in several cities. The American Museum of Natural History in New York is planning to remove a statue of Theodore Roosevelt.

Other statues that have been removed represent people from a broad spectrum of American history, including Spanish missionary Junípero Serra, former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, “Star-Spangled Banner” lyricist Francis Scott Key and the former owners of two NFL teams.





Why there’s debate

The lines of argument about Confederate statues are familiar and relatively straightforward, though public support for removing them appears to be growing. The discussion becomes more complex when focus shifts to the Founding Fathers and other central figures in U.S. history.

At the core of the debate is whether the positive things those people did override their sins. Washington and Jefferson, for example, helped free the American colonies from British rule and establish a nation built on the ideals of liberty and equality. They were also slave owners, and they built a system of government that denied freedom and equality to anyone who wasn’t a white man.

To some critics, these offenses are so deeply immoral that they supersede anything else Washington and Jefferson did. Any monument to a slave owner, they argue, serves as an implicit endorsement of white supremacy and should be taken down. The same logic is applied to individuals who committed atrocities against native peoples, like Columbus and President Andrew Jackson.

Opponents of these arguments say that destroying monuments to complicated historical figures only serves to bury the realities of American history. The past should be remembered for both its triumphs and its ugliness, they argue. If given the proper context, the statues can provide an opportunity to discuss a more complete version of our nation’s past. Others say it’s good to reconsider which monuments should stand, but the decision should be made by governments, not mobs of protesters.

What’s next

President Trump on Friday signed an executive order he said would lead to “long jail sentences” for demonstrators who tear down historical statues. The order strengthens existing laws that ban destruction of federal monuments and threatens to withhold funding from local governments that allow monuments to be destroyed.

Perspectives

The Founding Fathers should be remembered for both the good and the bad they did

“The fact that Washington, Jefferson and other early presidents owned slaves should temper our admiration for them but not erase it entirely. They gave us a nation grotesquely disfigured by slavery, but they also gave us the constitutional tools, and the high-minded ideals, with which to heal that original, near-fatal flaw.” — Eugene Robinson, Washington Post

All statues of slave owners should come down

“We need to call slave owners out for what they are, whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not. … So, to me, I don’t care if it’s a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or Robert E. Lee statue. They all need to come down.” — Angela Rye, CNN

We can chronicle history without building monuments to racists

“Needless to say, there are lots of ways to remember unpleasant history without erecting statues to the worst villains of it. The German government understands this, which is why they don’t have statues of Hitler astride a horse, and didn’t name the Munich airport after Joseph Goebbels.” — Amanda Marcotte, Salon",www.news.yahoo.com,center,f6r868Q3Dk6ZRB45

In a tweet Wednesday afternoon , Trump strongly opposed renaming the 10 U.S. Army bases that are named after Confederate officers . As he put it :
These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage , and a history of Winning , Victory , and Freedom . The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds , and won two World Wars . Therefore , my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations . Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with . Respect our Military !
Trump displayed no understanding of just who the namesakes of these bases were—nor that these bases were given their names after World War I and , in some cases , after World War II .
He tweeted his objection in the wake of news that his acting secretary of the army , Ryan McCarthy , expressed a willingness to have a “ bipartisan conversation ” about renaming the bases . McCarthy ’ s statement came after retired Gen. David Petraeus , former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , wrote an article for the Atlantic late last week , headlined , “ Take the Confederate Names Off Our Army Bases . ”
Since then , three retired Army colonels , who had notable careers in their time on active duty , Mike Jason , John Nagl , and Paul Yingling , made a similar argument in DefenseOne .
In short , 155 years after the end of the Civil War , the U.S. Army seems on the verge of accepting the full terms of the Union victory .
Meanwhile , Trump is , as usual , clueless about the history of the country he supposedly leads . And rather than take the lead on a movement to redress the symbolism of white supremacy , a step that shouldn ’ t be so difficult , he once again prefers to bask in what he sees as the buzzwords of his base—STRENGTH ! HEROES ! MILITARY ! —even as decorated veterans , who embody those values more authentically than he ever will , are coming to terms with the sinful roots of certain aspects of their tradition .
All 10 of the Army bases are in former Confederate states in the South . Fort Benning , Georgia , home of several armored and infantry brigades , is named after Gen. Henry Benning , whose support for slavery was so avid that he proposed seceding from the Union and forming a Southern slavocracy more than a decade before the Civil War began . Fort Bragg , North Carolina , home of the 82nd Airborne Division , is named after Gen. Braxton Bragg , who wasn ’ t even a good officer ; he got into so many quarrels with superiors and subordinates that he once missed an opportunity to exploit a weakness in Union Gen. Ulysses Grant ’ s formation . Fort Gordon , Georgia , home of the Army Cyber Corps , is named after Gen. John Brown Gordon , a slave owner who rose quickly through the Confederate ranks and , after the war , joined the Ku Klux Klan . The list goes on .
In his Atlantic article , Petraeus wrote that , in his many years as an active-duty officer , often stationed at these bases ,
I never thought much about these men—about the nature of their service during the Civil War … the reasons they were honored , or the timing of the various forts ’ dedications . Nor did I think about the message those names sent to the many African Americans serving on these installations—messages that should have been noted by all of us .
Nor , when he was a cadet at West Point , did he question the veneration shown toward Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee , who was a great commander but also—like all the other Confederate officers—guilty of treason . “ We were not encouraged to think deeply about the cause for which ” Lee had fought , Petraeus writes , “ at least not in our military history classes . ”
Petraeus told me , in an email on Wednesday , that it was only after he retired from the Army , in 2011 , that he “ started thinking about how strange it was that the leaders of the fight against the Union were more widely honored—with their names on federal forts , roads , barracks , gates , housing areas , etc.—than were those who fought for the country . And , of course , those fighting to secede were doing so to preserve the rights of their states to enslave others , with those ‘ others ’ now roughly 20 percent of the soldiers serving on those bases . ”
These thoughts deepened as he read several biographies of Gen. Ulysses Grant , the Union Army commander and later two-term president , who was honored hardly at all either at West Point or Army bases . Petraeus says he has “ been mulling for some time ” that the Army should publicly address this dishonor . “ The events of recent weeks , ” he said , “ were the catalyst to write the essay . ”
John Nagl graduated from West Point in 1988—14 years after Petraeus—but the treatment of Confederate heroes remained the same . He didn ’ t see the light until 2017 , when protests began over Confederate monuments in several Southern cities . Also in that year , Rep. Yvette Clarke introduced a bill in Congress to strip Army bases of Confederate names—to the firm opposition of the Army and with little support from her colleagues in the House .
The controversy spurred Nagl , who is now the head of a boys ’ school in Pennsylvania , to read up on the history of the monuments . “ It was then , ” he wrote me in an email on Wednesday , “ that I learned that they had been erected long after the Civil War , as part of Jim Crow racial terror reinforcement , and learned as well that the Army had named posts and forts after Confederate generals in the same era . It ’ s been simmering inside me since , and the current moment seemed like an opportunity to help the service I love so well right a longstanding wrong . ”
Mike Jason graduated from West Point later still , in 1995 , as a military history major , and by then the academy was changing . The history department “ was already using words for treason when it came to Confederate graduates , ” he wrote me in an email . “ The reverence was definitely in severe decline. ” His lightning-bolt moment—when the names of the bases became more than merely “ uncomfortable or silly ” —came when Jason was an Army captain , moving back from a tour in Europe to D.C. “ I just imagined being in the shoes of one of my black NCOs [ noncommissioned officers ] , driving by a confederate monument on Jefferson Davis Highway to a Ft. Lee or Ft. Pickett—it stopped me dead in my tracks . ”
Jason , who is now a defense consultant , “ got hot on the issue ” just this past February , soon after retiring from the Army , when he posted a tweet recalling the time , back in 2008 , when his brigade commander ordered the removal of all Confederate regalia . The Army Times called him for an interview ; he went on the record to discuss the issue and afterward started “ sounding the bell on social media ” constantly . “ Many officers have reached out to me for mentorship and to talk it over. ” Other officers , NCOs , and enlisted men and women have kept up the discussion .
In short , the issue has been festering quietly , behind the scenes , for some time . And now , with the vast protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , the suddenly swift passage of new laws and regulations on police behavior , and the realization by even the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the Republicans have to do something about the scourge of racism and the brutality of many police departments—it ’ s no surprise that the discussion of the 10 Confederate-named bases has risen to the fore as well , even if their president has his head in the sand .
Opinion on this , as on the many other issues raised by the Floyd killing , is shifting quickly . As recently as February , soon after the Marine Corps announced it was banning the display of Confederate flags , an Army spokesman said his service had no plans to rename military bases . “ The Army has a tradition of naming installations and streets after historical figures of military significance , including Union and Confederate general officers , ” he told Task & Purpose magazine .
This answer would now be unacceptable to anyone besides Trump . The valor of an officer can no longer be separated from the criminal depravity of his cause , and many of the still-honored Confederate officers lacked so much as valor . Nor , more broadly , can history be minimized as the inanimate stuff of street signs , statues , or military bases . History is a living thing . Those signs , statues , and bases mark the honoring and therefore the legitimizing of the causes that their namesakes fought for—causes that should never have been honored in the United States of America . It is long past time to attach them to names and causes that are worthy .

The Army Times called him for an interview; he went on the record to discuss the issue and afterward started “sounding the bell on social media” constantly. “Many officers have reached out to me for mentorship and to talk it over.” Other officers, NCOs, and enlisted men and women have kept up the discussion.

In short, the issue has been festering quietly, behind the scenes, for some time. And now, with the vast protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the suddenly swift passage of new laws and regulations on police behavior, and the realization by even the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the Republicans have to do something about the scourge of racism and the brutality of many police departments—it’s no surprise that the discussion of the 10 Confederate-named bases has risen to the fore as well, even if their president has his head in the sand.

Opinion on this, as on the many other issues raised by the Floyd killing, is shifting quickly. As recently as February, soon after the Marine Corps announced it was banning the display of Confederate flags, an Army spokesman said his service had no plans to rename military bases. “The Army has a tradition of naming installations and streets after historical figures of military significance, including Union and Confederate general officers,” he told Task & Purpose magazine.

This answer would now be unacceptable to anyone besides Trump. The valor of an officer can no longer be separated from the criminal depravity of his cause, and many of the still-honored Confederate officers lacked so much as valor. Nor, more broadly, can history be minimized as the inanimate stuff of street signs, statues, or military bases. History is a living thing. Those signs, statues, and bases mark the honoring and therefore the legitimizing of the causes that their namesakes fought for—causes that should never have been honored in the United States of America. It is long past time to attach them to names and causes that are worthy.

Hundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew to gather in the streets around a police station burnt the previous night.

“We are out here because we, as a generation, realize things have to change,” said one marcher, Paul Selman, a 25-year-old black man, who had just graduated with a master’s degree in English from Minnesota State. “We need peace.”

Peter McMahon, 26, a resident of the area around the police station and owner of two nearby properties, said, “This is my generation and these are the people I went to high school with,” adding, “This is not a surprise. I have lost good friends over this Black Lives Matter shit.”

DETROIT

Hundreds in the automotive capital joined a “March Against Police Brutality” late in the afternoon outside the Detroit Public Safety Headquarters. Many chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Some carried signs that read, “End police brutality” and “I won’t stop yelling until everyone can breathe.”

A 19-year-old man protesting in the city was shot dead on Friday night by a suspect who pulled up to demonstrators in a sport utility vehicle and fired gunshots into the crowd, then fled, the Detroit Free Press and other local media reported. Police could not immediately be reached for comment.

DENVER

Denver saw a second day of protests after hundreds marched peacefully through its downtown demanding justice for Floyd.

HOUSTON

Hundreds gathered on Friday in a protest organized by the group Black Lives Matter at City Hall. The crowd spilled onto Interstate 45’s entrance ramp near downtown chanting, “I can’t breathe,” and “No justice, no peace.”

LOUISVILLE

After a night of violence in which at least seven people were shot, police in the Kentucky city braced for more protests over the killing of Floyd and several others, such as Breonna Taylor, shot by police in her Louisville home in March.",www.reuters.com,center,ok5MD1AUhzWgIZRZ

Racism is a fact. A fact that seriously affect people of color in this country. Black and brown people have been victimized by the chronic normalization of the dynamics of racism—social exclusion, economic disadvantage, democratic disqualification and lack of social equality.

Racism is so prevalent that people are often not able to recognize it even when it slaps them on the face. It has been organized, codified, and structured in our society.

Institutional discrimination is not a political movement. It is an ingrained way of life. It is often complicated by economics to the point of being inclusive of affluence as an achievement. It allows for proximity to the supreme group, but never full acceptance.

Equality and Discrimination

One may have earned the privilege of being part of the club as an associate because one has succeeded financially, but one is never an equal. At best you are considered “one of the good ones,” exclusive of the balance of your race.

Institutional discrimination is so prevalent that, by default and often by design, pervasive neglects have been imposed to help continue the desired segregation.

Black people have historically been sadistically marginalized and since their importation as slave labor. Brown people have been neglected and socially abandoned since their land was taken from them in the mid 1800’s. Yet, they are allowed to work American land as replacements for the aforementioned free labor from across the sea.

The most serious consequence of this is poverty. Poverty is an institutional form of control by which the supremacist power binds those in poverty and manipulates them to believe that their poverty is a consequence of ignorance and lack of education.

That their situation is entirely of their own making and even endemic. The systemized lack of education is an effective tool for continued suppression in order to continue the cycle of poverty and dis-assimilation.

At its worst, it forces a high level of toxic identity in which the oppressed begin to question their value in society. It also attacks individual self-esteem, often to an extent where many in these groups begin to believe that they are unworthy and deserving of what little society has to offer them. Like an individual wallowing in a personal bubble of misery, these entire groups can be gobbled up in a miasma of despair.

Colorblindness vs. Acceptance

Institutional discrimination is not going to disappear, but it can be tamed by reducing its intensity. Like a mental illness, it is the frequency, intensity and dysfunction caused that is the most pressing issue. Also like a disease, it cannot be treated without some inherent risks. Treatments are never truly curing. They are methods used to decrease the negative effects of an existing, and possibly permanent, condition.

We black and brown people are not asking for color blindness. We are asking for acceptance and equality of our shades sufficient enough that any self-assertion and pride of our color not to seen as a threat.

We are not asking to be loved or liked. That will probably never happen. What we hope for is that institutional discrimination ceases its fear of us, and sees us as Americans under the same flag and with the same inalienable rights provided in our Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

Institutional discrimination forces people of color into a position of defensiveness and justification of our existence. In essence, demanding we “prove that we are equal.” That question is the ultimate insult. It demeans us. It dehumanizes us and often leads to violence.

Our anger is their weapon. It is used against us to point out our disruption to their society. Assertiveness not dominance, pride not presumption, coupled with empathic and non-judgmental listening to the grievances of the other side are better tools to generate change.

Violence and Revolutions

I have seen this movie many times, and will likely end with some laws being changed, commissions being formed to study the “roots of the problem,” along with lots of chest pounding to fuel the news cycle. We will feel good for a little while, but will accomplish little.

This is the insidious perpetuation of structural and institutional discrimination. People can survive eons on hope alone. However, hope without change is just manipulation for another groups end. It is a cycle that needs to be broken.

Nevertheless, hope is the starting point. It will continue to be difficult. There will be pain, loss and suffering on all sides. However, it is worth the slower pace of functional and long-term change in order for society to move past this. These are generational challenges. Ones that will not be fully rectified in my lifetime, yet they are worthy of pursuit.

Spasmodic eruptions of violence can be cathartic, but rarely lead to change. Full on revolutions rarely play out the way the instigators planned. Somebody said, may years ago, that “revolutions only change the beneficiaries of injustice.” This may indeed be true, so the more iterative moves are favored if one seeks true and permanent change.

The Concept Of Supremacy

If we are serious about structural change, we have to be willing to grieve losses. The first loss must be the idea of supremacy itself. No one race, is greater than another, for there is but one true race—the human race. Every creed, color, ethnicity and faith has contributed at one point or another to human evolution and civil society.

Each has influenced the development of mankind, increased our knowledge and abilities and moved us closer to unity. Though there are upheavals and low-points, the general trend is toward togetherness. Transportation technology allowed us to intermingle, information technology to share ideas and concepts. What next development, invented by whomever, will take us the next step forward in the evolution of humanity.

In the present, it is obvious that people of all colors want to be heard and understood without judgement or vehemence. A challenge for sure, as our egos and long suppressed anger boils over so easily. Regardless, we have to be willing to listen. Parents, politicians, educational institutions and communities must educate their members that it is our cultural differences make us stronger. We must also learn to disagree without insisting that our view is the only view.

Supremacy of one group’s ideal over another’s is true tyranny. We must institute programs in schools that educate our children about the meaning of racial identity, structural racism and cultural differences. We must educate ourselves to focus more on the how, and less in the why. We must take communal risks of grieving together and not separately. All lives, indeed, do matter. When we continue to separate and segregate, we all become victims.

As society becomes more diverse, the structure of institutional discrimination is more frequently challenged and questioned. Like any organism fighting for its survival, the more it is cornered, the more they viscously they fight. All while unknowingly hurting themselves even further as they push themselves father away from the mainstream of contemporary society.

This simply fuels the fire. It is not about eradicating racism, but managing it. Allowing these tensions to tear our Nation apart is the greatest threat to us all. And there are many willing to use this dysfunction for their personal gain. Hence our current political environment and significant internal interference from foreign powers. The obvious lack of leadership and inflammatory rhetoric only fuel the fires of discontent.

The supremacists are losing, and with loss comes grief—the loss of people, loss of possessions, loss of status, loss of money. Sometimes grieving becomes so chronic that becomes a way of life. This then frequently turns into anger and destruction directed both inward and outward. This has placed them in a position so familiar to us. That of the victim. They now feel oppressed and controlled and are reacting similarly. They key now is to work together to manage the enviable social changes.

The Grieving Process

The “how” is not about fighting, rioting, destroying or any other violent process. It is about helping those on the losing side of the battle bear the indignities often associated with loss. The global pallor is now multi-shaded. There is no changing that.

How then do we help them move on? By asking a simple question: How can I help you to grieve? Not in a derisive way, but in a truly empathetic one. Much like the loss of a struggle, a contest, or war, the victors are always best served to then lend themselves to helping the vanquished.

Let us hope that this is the last true battle of racial supremacy. That those on the inevitably losing end can find a way to live harmoniously with shades other than their own. As a person of color, it is my duty to help them find that way for the sake of all of us. It is all of our collective duties.

Black people are grieving. Police officers are grieving. Latinos are grieving. And everybody is scared. Racism is a scourge, a disease, an illness. If this concurrent pandemic can teach us anything about that, it is the reality that we are all in this together. United, we stand.

Mahoney, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Kevin D. Williamson, John Mccormack, Mario Loyola, Armond White","A few days ago , former police officer Jason Stockley , who is white , was acquitted of first-degree murder ; he had fatally shot Anthony Lamar Smith , who was black , in 2011 . Protests started in St. Louis , where the shooting took place and Stockley was judged , immediately after the verdict was announced . Although they were initially peaceful , they soon turned violent , and dozens of protesters were arrested while several police officers were injured . Since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , just outside St. Louis , in 2014 , this has become a familiar pattern .
This article is not about whether Stockley should have been acquitted . Instead , I want to talk about the underlying narrative regarding the prevalence of police brutality against black men in the U.S. , which is largely undisputed in the media .
According to this narrative , black men are constantly harassed by the police and routinely brutalized with impunity , even when they have done nothing wrong , and there is an “ epidemic of police shootings of unarmed black men. ” Even high-profile black celebrities often claim to be afraid of the police because the same thing might happen to them . Police brutality , or at least the possibility that one might become a victim of such violence , is supposed to be part of the experience of a typical black man in the U.S. Events such as the death of Brown in Ferguson are presented as proof that black men are never safe from the police .
This narrative is false . In reality , a randomly selected black man is overwhelmingly unlikely to be victim of police violence — and though white men experience such violence even less often , the disparity is consistent with the racial gap in violent crime , suggesting that the role of racial bias is small . The media ’ s acceptance of the false narrative poisons the relations between law enforcement and black communities throughout the country and results in violent protests that destroy property and sometimes even claim lives . Perhaps even more importantly , the narrative distracts from far more serious problems that black Americans face .
Let ’ s start with the question of fatal violence . Last year , according to the Washington Post ’ s tally , just 16 unarmed black men , out of a population of more than 20 million , were killed by the police . The year before , the number was 36 . These figures are likely close to the number of black men struck by lightning in a given year , considering that happens to about 300 Americans annually and black men are 7 percent of the population . And they include cases where the shooting was justified , even if the person killed was unarmed .
Of course , police killings are not the result of a force of nature , and I ’ m not claiming these are morally equivalent . But the comparison illustrates that these killings are incredibly rare , and that it ’ s completely misleading to talk about an “ epidemic ” of them . You don ’ t hear people talk about an epidemic of lightning strikes and claim they are afraid to go outside because of it . Liberals often make the same comparison when they argue that it ’ s completely irrational to fear that you might become a victim of terrorism .
One might retort that , while it may be rare for a black man to be killed by the police , black men are still constantly stopped and routinely brutalized by the police , even if they don ’ t die from it . However , even this weaker claim is false . It just isn ’ t true that black men are kicked , punched , etc. , on a regular basis by the police .
In order to show that , I ’ m going to use data from the Police-Public Contact Survey ( PPCS ) , which , as its name suggests , provides detailed information about contacts between the police and the public . It ’ s conducted on a regular basis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) and is based on a nationally representative sample of more than 70,000 U.S. residents age 16 or older . Respondents are asked whether they had a contact with the police during the past 12 months ; if they say they did , they answer a battery of questions about the nature of their last contact , including any use of force . Since the respondents also provide their age , race , gender , etc. , we can use this survey to calculate the prevalence of police violence for various demographic groups . The numbers in this piece are from my own analysis of the data , the details and code for which I provide here , but they are consistent with a 2015 report compiled by the BJS itself to the extent the two overlap .
It ’ s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason .
First , despite what the narrative claims , it ’ s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason . Indeed , black men are less likely than white men to have contact with the police in any given year , though this includes situations where the respondent called the cops himself : 17.5 percent versus 20.7 percent . Similarly , a black man has on average only 0.32 contacts with the police in any given year , compared with 0.35 contacts for a white man . It ’ s true that black men are overrepresented among people who have many contacts with the police , but not by much . Only 1.5 percent of black men have more than three contacts with the police in any given year , whereas 1.2 percent of white men do .
If we look at how often the police use physical force against men of different races , we find that there is indeed a racial disparity , but that this experience is rare across the board . Only 0.6 percent of black men experience physical force by the police in any given year , while approximately 0.2 percent of white men do . To be fair , these are probably slight undercounts , because the survey does not allow us to identify people who did not experience physical force during their most recent contact but did experience such force during a previous contact in the same year .
Further , physical force as defined by the PPCS includes relatively mild forms of violence such as pushing and grabbing . Actual injuries by the police are so rare that one can not estimate them very precisely even in a survey as big as the PPCS , but the available data suggest that only 0.08 percent of black men are injured by the police each year , approximately the same rate as for white men . A black man is about 44 times as likely to suffer a traffic-related injury , according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey . Moreover , keep in mind that these tallies of police violence include violence that is legally justified .
Now , it ’ s true that there are significant differences in the rates at which men of different races experience police violence — 0.6 percent is triple 0.2 percent . However , although people often equate racial disparities with bias , this inference is fallacious , as can be seen through an analogy with gender : Men are vastly more likely to experience police violence than women are , but while bias may explain part of this disparity , nobody doubts that most of it has to do with the fact that men are on average far more violent than women . Similarly , if black men commit violent crimes at much higher rates than white men , that might have a lot to do with the disparity in the use of force by the police .
This is evident in the National Crime Victimization Survey , another survey of the public conducted by the BJS . Interviewers ask respondents if they have been the victim of a crime in the past 12 months ; if they have , respondents provide information about the nature of the incidents , including the race and ethnicity of the offenders . This makes it possible to measure racial differences in crime rates without relying on data from the criminal-justice system , in which racial bias could lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction for black men even if they commit violence at the same rate .
Racial bias is unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy .
NCVS data from 2015 , the most recent year available , suggest that black men are three times as likely to commit violent crimes as white men . To the extent that cops are more likely to use force against people who commit violent crimes , which they surely are , this could easily explain the disparities we have observed in the rates at which the police use force . That ’ s not to say that bias plays no role ; I ’ m sure it does play one . But it ’ s unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy .
Some might say that , instead of consulting statistics like these , we should defer to black Americans ’ own perceptions of how the police treat them . As various polls have demonstrated , black people are much more likely than white people to think that police violence against minorities is very common . But the issue can not be settled this way .
Since individuals have direct knowledge of what happened to them personally , you can trust them about that . But when it comes to larger social phenomena , people ’ s beliefs are influenced by far more than just their personal experience , including the media . The far more compelling fact is that , if you draw a representative sample of the population and ask each black man in that sample whether a police officer has used physical force against him in the past year , you find that it ’ s extremely rare .
On many issues , liberals have no problem recognizing this problem . For instance , there is a cottage industry of articles deploring the fact that , although crime has fallen spectacularly in the U.S. since the 1990s , most Americans believe it has increased . Liberals are absolutely right to point out this misperception , but if people of any color can be wrong about this , there is no reason to think black people can ’ t be wrong about the prevalence of police violence against minorities .","A protester confronts police during demonstrations in St. Louis, Mo., September 16, 2017.

This article is not about whether Stockley should have been acquitted. Instead, I want to talk about the underlying narrative regarding the prevalence of police brutality against black men in the U.S., which is largely undisputed in the media.

According to this narrative, black men are constantly harassed by the police and routinely brutalized with impunity, even when they have done nothing wrong, and there is an “epidemic of police shootings of unarmed black men.” Even high-profile black celebrities often claim to be afraid of the police because the same thing might happen to them.

This narrative is false. In reality, a randomly selected black man is overwhelmingly unlikely to be victim of police violence — and though white men experience such violence even less often, the disparity is consistent with the racial gap in violent crime, suggesting that the role of racial bias is small. The media’s acceptance of the false narrative poisons the relations between law enforcement and black communities throughout the country and results in violent protests that destroy property and sometimes even claim lives. Perhaps even more importantly, the narrative distracts from far more serious problems that black Americans face.

Let’s start with the question of fatal violence. Last year, according to the Washington Post’s tally, just 16 unarmed black men, out of a population of more than 20 million, were killed by the police. The year before, the number was 36. These figures are likely close to the number of black men struck by lightning in a given year, considering that happens to about 300 Americans annually and black men are 7 percent of the population. And they include cases where the shooting was justified, even if the person killed was unarmed.

Of course, police killings are not the result of a force of nature, and I’m not claiming these are morally equivalent. But the comparison illustrates that these killings are incredibly rare, and that it’s completely misleading to talk about an “epidemic” of them. You don’t hear people talk about an epidemic of lightning strikes and claim they are afraid to go outside because of it. Liberals often make the same comparison when they argue that it’s completely irrational to fear that you might become a victim of terrorism.

One might retort that, while it may be rare for a black man to be killed by the police, black men are still constantly stopped and routinely brutalized by the police, even if they don’t die from it. However, even this weaker claim is false. It just isn’t true that black men are kicked, punched, etc., on a regular basis by the police.

In order to show that, I’m going to use data from the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), which, as its name suggests, provides detailed information about contacts between the police and the public. It’s conducted on a regular basis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and is based on a nationally representative sample of more than 70,000 U.S. residents age 16 or older.

Since the respondents also provide their age, race, gender, etc., we can use this survey to calculate the prevalence of police violence for various demographic groups. The numbers in this piece are from my own analysis of the data, the details and code for which I provide here, but they are consistent with a 2015 report compiled by the BJS itself to the extent the two overlap.

It’s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason.

First, despite what the narrative claims, it’s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason. Indeed, black men are less likely than white men to have contact with the police in any given year, though this includes situations where the respondent called the cops himself: 17.5 percent versus 20.7 percent.

Further, physical force as defined by the PPCS includes relatively mild forms of violence such as pushing and grabbing. Actual injuries by the police are so rare that one cannot estimate them very precisely even in a survey as big as the PPCS, but the available data suggest that only 0.08 percent of black men are injured by the police each year, approximately the same rate as for white men. A black man is about 44 times as likely to suffer a traffic-related injury, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Moreover, keep in mind that these tallies of police violence include violence that is legally justified.

Now, it’s true that there are significant differences in the rates at which men of different races experience police violence — 0.6 percent is triple 0.2 percent. However, although people often equate racial disparities with bias, this inference is fallacious, as can be seen through an analogy with gender: Men are vastly more likely to experience police violence than women are, but while bias may explain part of this disparity, nobody doubts that most of it has to do with the fact that men are on average far more violent than women. Similarly, if black men commit violent crimes at much higher rates than white men, that might have a lot to do with the disparity in the use of force by the police.

This is evident in the National Crime Victimization Survey, another survey of the public conducted by the BJS. Interviewers ask respondents if they have been the victim of a crime in the past 12 months; if they have, respondents provide information about the nature of the incidents, including the race and ethnicity of the offenders. This makes it possible to measure racial differences in crime rates without relying on data from the criminal-justice system, in which racial bias could lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction for black men even if they commit violence at the same rate.

Racial bias is unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy.

NCVS data from 2015, the most recent year available, suggest that black men are three times as likely to commit violent crimes as white men. To the extent that cops are more likely to use force against people who commit violent crimes, which they surely are, this could easily explain the disparities we have observed in the rates at which the police use force. That’s not to say that bias plays no role; I’m sure it does play one. But it’s unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy.

Some might say that, instead of consulting statistics like these, we should defer to black Americans’ own perceptions of how the police treat them. As various polls have demonstrated, black people are much more likely than white people to think that police violence against minorities is very common. But the issue cannot be settled this way.

Since individuals have direct knowledge of what happened to them personally, you can trust them about that. But when it comes to larger social phenomena, people’s beliefs are influenced by far more than just their personal experience, including the media. The far more compelling fact is that, if you draw a representative sample of the population and ask each black man in that sample whether a police officer has used physical force against him in the past year, you find that it’s extremely rare.

On many issues, liberals have no problem recognizing this problem. For instance, there is a cottage industry of articles deploring the fact that, although crime has fallen spectacularly in the U.S. since the 1990s, most Americans believe it has increased. Liberals are absolutely right to point out this misperception, but if people of any color can be wrong about this, there is no reason to think black people can’t be wrong about the prevalence of police violence against minorities.",www.nationalreview.com,right,Q0qJqe8Qgy8IWI88

In Chicago , police released a video that showed a white police officer fatally shooting a black teen 16 times because he refused to drop a knife ; many of the shots were fired after the teen had already fallen to the ground . The officer was charged with first-degree murder Tuesday , but activists note that it had taken more than a year and a lawsuit to get the video released – and charges were not brought until hours before the video was made public .
In Minneapolis , five Black Lives Matter protesters were shot Monday night – though not seriously wounded – at one of a series of nightly rallies outside the Fourth Precinct for Jamar Clark , a black man fatally shot by police on Nov. 15 . Protesters said they had been harassed by both online death threats and a group of masked men who filmed the protesters and made racist remarks .

The Minneapolis protests Tuesday night included a march on City Hall by nearly 1,000 people , as well as a visit to the sidewalk protest site by Rep.

I think in a situation like that we show great restraint . ''
The tensions between the two communities were highlighted further this week when a police officer in Oregon was taken off street duty after calling Black Lives Matter protesters fools . Ahead of a planned protest in Portland , Ore. , he tweeted : “ Black Lives Matter is planning to protest at Lloyd Center on black Friday . Oh joy , stuck late again at work to babysit these fools . ”

President Obama compared himself to Trayvon Martin in a speech Friday
WASHINGTON — The searing heat of July was not enough to deter 60-year-old Terri White from joining Saturday 's `` Justice for Trayvon '' rally at high noon outside the federal courthouse here .
White , a Baltimore psychotherapist , said she had to attend because she `` felt disbelief and disgust '' after a Florida jury acquitted former neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Zimmerman claimed self-defense . White was n't buying it .
`` I have two African-American sons and grandsons and I want to see things change for them , '' White said as protesters chanted `` No justice , no peace . ''
Thousands gathered Saturday at rallies in more than 100 cities nationwide to remember Trayvon , to press for federal civil rights charges against the man who shot him , and to attack stand-your-ground self-defense laws . The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman , 29 , violated Martin 's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford , Fla .
Although Zimmerman ultimately did not use a `` stand your ground '' defense , the case brought stand-your-ground laws into the spotlight.At a rally in New York City , civil rights activist Al Sharpton took aim at those laws , which in more than a dozen states generally give people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear serious bodily harm . `` We are trying to change laws so that this never , ever happens again , '' Sharpton , who organized the nationwide rallies through his National Action Network , told the crowd .
Sybrina Fulton , Trayvon 's mother , spoke at the New York rally . `` Today it was my son . Tomorrow it might be yours , '' she warned the crowd . Trayvon 's father , Tracy Martin , echoed those sentiments at a rally in Miami . `` This could be any one of our children , '' he said . `` Our mission now is to make sure that this does n't happen to your child . ''
In Indianapolis , where a rally at the Birch Bayh Federal Building was cut short by a downpour , Pastor Michael K.Jones said the Zimmerman verdict `` should be a wake up call to us just like 9/11 was for all us in America . ''
`` Do you know what America did after 9/11 ? We made some changes , '' Jones said . `` I came by today to tell someone 7/13 will never happen again . ''
The rallies drew the rich and famous , including Beyoncé and Jay Z in New York , but mostly the crowds consisted of regular folks who felt justice was not served at Zimmerman 's trial .
In Washington , D.C. , protester Hellen Smith , 45 , who brought her 14-year-old daughter , said she had mixed emotions about the verdict . She said jurors may not have had enough evidence to convict , but added that `` we have to stand up for any person of any race who has been unjustly murdered . ''
Washington resident Ralph Reynaud , 69 , said the verdict shows that many people connect more easily with Zimmerman than with a black teen . `` There was no justice , '' Reynaud said . `` The letter of the law was executed , but the spirit of it was invalidated . ''
In Nashville , a rally-turned-prayer-service drew about 500 people . Brandi Walker of Goodlettsville and her three children were among them , carrying signs that read `` I am Travyon Martin '' and decorated with Skittles candy wrappers . Martin was returning home from a convenience store with some of those candies the night he died .
Walker said the verdict in the Zimmerman trial made her afraid for her sons , who are 11 and 13 . `` They are not expendable , '' she said .
• In Detroit , Onikha Lemurian said she joined thousands of others who gathered for outside the federal courthouse because she wanted to help guarantee a safer future for her grandsons . `` In this case , I do n't think justice was served , '' said Lemurian , 70 , of Detroit . `` I did not want to think that this would recur here or anywhere else . ''
• In Wilmington , Del. , about 100 people — almost all of them African-American — gathered outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building as passersby honked their horns in support . Local resident Mary Gilbert was upbeat , saying the verdict in the case will eventually have a positive effect on society . `` God is never wrong , so the verdict is n't wrong , '' Gilbert said . `` It 's making people of all races realize that something is wrong . ''
• In Asheville , N.C. , where about 50 people gathered at the Vance Monument to tolerance , 16-year-old Liana Murray collected signatures on a petition urging the federal Justice Department to file charges against Zimmerman . `` He racially profiled and stalked a child and shot him because he was wearing a hoodie , '' Murray said . `` Wearing a hoodie and being a black young man in the U.S. is something seen as suspicious . ''
Most of the rallies and vigils were taking place outside federal court buildings . Sharpton said the vigils will be followed by a conference next week in Miami to develop a plan to address Florida 's stand-your-ground law .
The rallies came a day after President Obama , speaking to reporters at an impromptu gathering in the White House briefing room , said that all Americans should respect the jury 's acquittal of Zimmerman , but that white Americans should also understand that African Americans are pained by Trayvon 's death and continue to face racial discrimination .
Obama told reporters that , like other African Americans , he has been followed by security guards while shopping , and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them . `` Those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida . ''
`` I think it 's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does n't go away , '' Obama said , and `` it 's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching . ''
The president also questioned the wisdom of Florida 's stand-your-ground law and suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground , adding : `` Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman , who had followed him in a car , because he felt threatened ?

The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman, 29, violated Martin's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla.

Although Zimmerman ultimately did not use a ""stand your ground"" defense, the case brought stand-your-ground laws into the spotlight.At a rally in New York City, civil rights activist Al Sharpton took aim at those laws, which in more than a dozen states generally give people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear serious bodily harm.""We are trying to change laws so that this never, ever happens again,"" Sharpton, who organized the nationwide rallies through his National Action Network, told the crowd.

Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, spoke at the New York rally. ""Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours,"" she warned the crowd. Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, echoed those sentiments at a rally in Miami. ""This could be any one of our children,"" he said. ""Our mission now is to make sure that this doesn't happen to your child.""

In Indianapolis, where a rally at the Birch Bayh Federal Building was cut short by a downpour, Pastor Michael K.Jones said the Zimmerman verdict ""should be a wake up call to us just like 9/11 was for all us in America.""

""Do you know what America did after 9/11? We made some changes,"" Jones said. ""I came by today to tell someone 7/13 will never happen again.""

The rallies drew the rich and famous, including Beyoncé and Jay Z in New York, but mostly the crowds consisted of regular folks who felt justice was not served at Zimmerman's trial.

In Washington, D.C., protester Hellen Smith, 45, who brought her 14-year-old daughter, said she had mixed emotions about the verdict. She said jurors may not have had enough evidence to convict, but added that ""we have to stand up for any person of any race who has been unjustly murdered.""

Washington resident Ralph Reynaud, 69, said the verdict shows that many people connect more easily with Zimmerman than with a black teen. ""There was no justice,"" Reynaud said. ""The letter of the law was executed, but the spirit of it was invalidated.""

In Nashville, a rally-turned-prayer-service drew about 500 people. Brandi Walker of Goodlettsville and her three children were among them, carrying signs that read ""I am Travyon Martin"" and decorated with Skittles candy wrappers. Martin was returning home from a convenience store with some of those candies the night he died.

Walker said the verdict in the Zimmerman trial made her afraid for her sons, who are 11 and 13. ""They are not expendable,"" she said.

Similar sentiments were expressed at rallies across the nation:

• In Detroit, Onikha Lemurian said she joined thousands of others who gathered for outside the federal courthouse because she wanted to help guarantee a safer future for her grandsons. ""In this case, I don't think justice was served,"" said Lemurian, 70, of Detroit. ""I did not want to think that this would recur here or anywhere else.""

• In Wilmington, Del., about 100 people — almost all of them African-American — gathered outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building as passersby honked their horns in support. Local resident Mary Gilbert was upbeat, saying the verdict in the case will eventually have a positive effect on society. ""God is never wrong, so the verdict isn't wrong,"" Gilbert said. ""It's making people of all races realize that something is wrong.""

• In Asheville, N.C., where about 50 people gathered at the Vance Monument to tolerance, 16-year-old Liana Murray collected signatures on a petition urging the federal Justice Department to file charges against Zimmerman.""He racially profiled and stalked a child and shot him because he was wearing a hoodie,"" Murray said. ""Wearing a hoodie and being a black young man in the U.S. is something seen as suspicious.""

Most of the rallies and vigils were taking place outside federal court buildings. Sharpton said the vigils will be followed by a conference next week in Miami to develop a plan to address Florida's stand-your-ground law.

The rallies came a day after President Obama, speaking to reporters at an impromptu gathering in the White House briefing room, said that all Americans should respect the jury's acquittal of Zimmerman, but that white Americans should also understand that African Americans are pained by Trayvon's death and continue to face racial discrimination.

Obama told reporters that, like other African Americans, he has been followed by security guards while shopping, and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them. ""Those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.""

""I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said, and ""it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.""

The president also questioned the wisdom of Florida's stand-your-ground law and suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground, adding: ""Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?""

race_and_racism,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/the_radical_mlk_we_need_today/,The radical MLK we need today,2014-01-20,Joan Walsh,"When Nelson Mandela died last month , I envied South Africans who had worked alongside him for freedom : Americans haven ’ t gotten to see many of our icons of justice get that old . My immediate thought was of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , assassinated at 39 , though Bobby and John Kennedy , Malcolm X and Medgar Evers , quickly followed .
But the inescapable image was King . Even if the freedom struggle of the 1960s didn ’ t end up letting King grow old like Mandela , let alone lead his country as president , it was hard not to compare the two , especially since Mandela so often declared his debt to his younger American ally .
King and Mandela had much in common , but one thing stands out this week : As they were lionized globally , both were deradicalized , pasteurized and homogenized , made safe for mass consumption . Each was in favor of a radical redistribution of global wealth . Each crusaded against poverty and inequality and war . Both did it with an equanimity and ebullience and capacity to forgive and love their enemies that made it easy to canonize them in a secular way . White people love being given the benefit of the doubt and/or being forgiven . I speak from experience .
But now , as the country turns again to issues of income inequality and poverty , and economic populism is said to be having a “ moment , ” maybe it ’ s time to remember Dr. King , the radical . The one who died trying to ignite a Poor People ’ s Movement that he saw as the natural outcome of the civil rights movement . The one who tried to branch out to fight poverty and war , but at least in his lifetime – and so far in ours – did n't succeed .
I loved pretty much everything about the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington last year , except how the right got it so wrong . It seemed to be the beginning of a movement to reclaim the real MLK , especially among liberals . King was of course celebrated hugely , but so were lefty heroes who never get enough credit , like Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph . There were stories about “ The Socialists Behind the March on Washington , ” as well as about the media ’ s and the Kennedy administration ’ s wrongheaded fears of violence .
Coming off of that gorgeous 50th anniversary celebration , though , where we remembered the triumph of King the strategist and organizer , let ’ s remember the King who tried and , by common measures , failed . Was n't feted , wasn ’ t lionized . King was always a radical , but at the end of his life , he was something of an outcast , criticized by liberals , the left and the right .
Forget about the right , for now : King crossed some Democrats and labor leaders when he turned against the Vietnam War in 1967 , after his unparalleled Riverside Church speech . He knew the war was not only wrong , but was making Johnson 's alleged `` War on Poverty '' fiscally impossible . Meanwhile a growing black power movement mocked King 's commitment to nonviolence and integration . Even some close allies in the civil rights movement blanched when he joined Marion Wright Edelman and other organizers to start a Poor People ’ s Campaign later that year – a movement of black , white , Latino , American Indian and Asian people mired in poverty , to fight the war and get the help they deserved . They were to march on Washington and set up a camp there in April 1968 , the month King was assassinated .
Harry Belafonte tells a story in his amazing memoir , “ My Song , ” about King being challenged by his SCLC deputies on his accelerating radicalism generally , and the Poor People ’ s Campaign specifically , just a week before he died . Describing King as a “ socialist and revolutionary thinker , ” Belafonte says he clashed with close ally and future Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador Andrew Young , over not only the Poor People ’ s Campaign , but King ’ s thoroughgoing critique of capitalism . Belafonte quotes King telling the group , gathered at the singer/actor/activist ’ s New York apartment : “ What deeply troubles me now is that for all the steps we ’ ve taken toward integration , I ’ ve come to believe that we are integrating into a burning house . ”
When Belafonte asks what that means they should do , an exhausted King tells him : “ I guess we ’ re just going to have to become firemen . ”
Assassinated a week later , King wouldn ’ t get to lead the Poor People ’ s Campaign . But almost 50 years later , most of us who think the way he did are still firemen in a burning house , constantly fighting the fires set by radical Republicans to make life worse for the people King cared most about , never getting around to building the sturdy , welcoming , capacious , fire-resistant dwelling that lives in our political imagination . King would be proud of our accomplishments , and also a little bit sad for us . Or maybe I 'm just projecting .
Some of King ’ s closest living allies have been trying hard to right the reverend 's record . “ There have been and continue to be efforts to ‘ neuter ’ or ‘ de-radicalize ’ the Dr. King who delivered his ' I Have a Dream ' speech in August , 1963 , ” says his longtime lawyer and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones . Though the dream speech , which Jones helped write , was itself radical , he sees King ’ s April 1967 “ Beyond Vietnam : Time to Break the Silence ” speech at Riverside Church as “ the ideological turning point for King . ”
Harry Belafonte likewise thinks much of American political culture “ is guilty of dealing with Dr. King ’ s life and story in grievously superficial ways . What gave us all strength to do what we did was his radical thinking. ” Acknowledging that King ’ s turn against the war and toward cross-racial , anti-poverty organizing was “ controversial ” among his closest colleagues , Belafonte notes : “ It was controversial , but controversy wasn ’ t something he shunned ; controversy became the system through which disagreement and debate could be heard . He was comfortable with that . He welcomed it . That aspect of his history is never really discussed .
`` The vested interests don ’ t want us speaking of Dr. King in radical terms , '' Belafonte continues . `` The great tragedy and irony of it all is that the public hungers for voices that are driven more by these moral concerns . ”
I ’ ve never waded into the debates over whether King was a “ socialist , ” though Belafonte and another close ally Julian Bond say he was ( to the chagrin of Glenn Beck , who of course tried to hijack the March on Washington anniversary a few years back ) . Socialism has been such a stigmatized and divisive and practically irrelevant notion in my lifetime ( even though I worked for a socialist newspaper ! ) that I 've never needed to claim King for its roster . But whatever we call King 's point of view , stripping him of his very obvious economic radicalism distorts not only his history but all of ours .
And as a younger generation shows more curiosity about political solutions that aren ’ t on the agenda , it may limit King ’ s appeal , too . A 2011 Pew poll found 49 percent of Americans 18 to 29 say they have a positive view of socialism vs. 43 percent with a negative view . Capitalism is underwater among that age group , with 46 percent positive and 47 percent negative . And here 's one of King 's most famous , resonant quotes about capitalism , from his August 1967 speech : `` Where Do We Go From Here ? '' ( I like this version , because it 's punctuated by his SCLC audience 's replies ) :
I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion , as we talk about `` Where do we go from here ? '' that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society . ( Yes ) There are forty million poor people here , and one day we must ask the question , `` Why are there forty million poor people in America ? '' And when you begin to ask that question , you are raising a question about the economic system , about a broader distribution of wealth . When you ask that question , you begin to question the capitalistic economy . ( Yes ) And I 'm simply saying that more and more , we 've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society . We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life 's marketplace . ( Yes ) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring . ( All right ) It means that questions must be raised . And you see , my friends , when you deal with this you begin to ask the question , `` Who owns the oil ? '' ( Yes ) You begin to ask the question , `` Who owns the iron ore ? '' ( Yes ) You begin to ask the question , `` Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that 's two-thirds water ? '' ( All right ) These are words that must be said . ( All right ) Now , do n't think you have me in a bind today . I 'm not talking about communism . What I 'm talking about is far beyond communism . ( Yeah ) My inspiration did n't come from Karl Marx ( Speak ) ; my inspiration did n't come from Engels ; my inspiration did n't come from Trotsky ; my inspiration did n't come from Lenin . Yes , I read Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital a long time ago ( Well ) , and I saw that maybe Marx did n't follow Hegel enough . ( All right ) He took his dialectics , but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism . And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach , and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called `` dialectical materialism . '' ( Speak ) I have to reject that . What I 'm saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual . ( Yes ) Capitalism forgets that life is social . ( Yes , Go ahead ) And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism , but in a higher synthesis . ( Speak ) [ applause ] It is found in a higher synthesis ( Come on ) that combines the truths of both . ( Yes ) Now , when I say questioning the whole society , it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism , the problem of economic exploitation , and the problem of war are all tied together . ( All right ) These are the triple evils that are interrelated .
Labels don ’ t matter , but solutions do . Rather than remembering King solely as a civil rights leader , we must reclaim him as a radical advocate of economic justice , looking to lead a multiracial movement of poor people to complete the unfinished business of the civil rights movement . As King put it plainly , “ What good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can ’ t buy a hamburger ? ” Post-integration , too many black people couldn ’ t sit down at integrated lunch counters and buy a hamburger ; 50 years later , too many people of every race have the same problem .
We are ready for the radical King now . President Obama , perhaps belatedly , has declared income inequality `` the defining issue of our time . '' Even poverty seems back on the agenda . The man who may be doing the most to advance these issues right now is n't a politician or a rabble rouser ; it 's Pope Francis , who 's been hailed by everyone from Obama to Paul Ryan ( Ryan gets him wrong ) as helping us make the issue of poverty central to our politics . `` If Dr. King were alive today , he would be in Rome visiting Pope Francis holding a joint press conference to summoning the world to aid the poor eradicate poverty , '' Clarence Jones says . The president promises he 's going to the Vatican to meet the new pope , and that 's a start .
For now , though , all these years later , King 's allies and inheritors are still fighting fires in a burning house . It 's time to rebuild the house with room for everyone , and keep it safer from the fiery danger of injustice .","When Nelson Mandela died last month, I envied South Africans who had worked alongside him for freedom: Americans haven’t gotten to see many of our icons of justice get that old.

And as a younger generation shows more curiosity about political solutions that aren’t on the agenda, it may limit King’s appeal, too. A 2011 Pew poll found 49 percent of Americans 18 to 29 say they have a positive view of socialism vs. 43 percent with a negative view. Capitalism is underwater among that age group, with 46 percent positive and 47 percent negative. And here's one of King's most famous, resonant quotes about capitalism, from his August 1967 speech: ""Where Do We Go From Here?"" (I like this version, because it's punctuated by his SCLC audience's replies):

I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about ""Where do we go from here?"" that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. (Yes) There are forty million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question, ""Why are there forty million poor people in America?"" And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a question about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. (Yes) And I'm simply saying that more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's marketplace. (Yes) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. (All right) It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, ""Who owns the oil?"" (Yes) You begin to ask the question, ""Who owns the iron ore?"" (Yes) You begin to ask the question, ""Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that's two-thirds water?"" (All right) These are words that must be said. (All right) Now, don't think you have me in a bind today. I'm not talking about communism. What I'm talking about is far beyond communism. (Yeah) My inspiration didn't come from Karl Marx (Speak); my inspiration didn't come from Engels; my inspiration didn't come from Trotsky; my inspiration didn't come from Lenin. Yes, I read Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital a long time ago (Well), and I saw that maybe Marx didn't follow Hegel enough. (All right) He took his dialectics, but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism. And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach, and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called ""dialectical materialism."" (Speak) I have to reject that. What I'm saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual. (Yes) Capitalism forgets that life is social. (Yes, Go ahead) And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. (Speak) [applause] It is found in a higher synthesis (Come on) that combines the truths of both. (Yes) Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. (All right) These are the triple evils that are interrelated.

Labels don’t matter, but solutions do. Rather than remembering King solely as a civil rights leader, we must reclaim him as a radical advocate of economic justice, looking to lead a multiracial movement of poor people to complete the unfinished business of the civil rights movement. As King put it plainly, “What good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can’t buy a hamburger?” Post-integration, too many black people couldn’t sit down at integrated lunch counters and buy a hamburger; 50 years later, too many people of every race have the same problem.

We are ready for the radical King now. President Obama, perhaps belatedly, has declared income inequality ""the defining issue of our time."" Even poverty seems back on the agenda. The man who may be doing the most to advance these issues right now isn't a politician or a rabble rouser; it's Pope Francis, who's been hailed by everyone from Obama to Paul Ryan (Ryan gets him wrong) as helping us make the issue of poverty central to our politics. ""If Dr. King were alive today, he would be in Rome visiting Pope Francis holding a joint press conference to summoning the world to aid the poor eradicate poverty,"" Clarence Jones says. The president promises he's going to the Vatican to meet the new pope, and that's a start.

For now, though, all these years later, King's allies and inheritors are still fighting fires in a burning house. It's time to rebuild the house with room for everyone, and keep it safer from the fiery danger of injustice.",www.salon.com,left,0XRTf70E1LCwlcrU

The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police last year have reignited the war liberals have waged against our cops. It’s “our cops” — not “the cops” — because no matter what our race, religion, economic circumstance, we all rely on the police for our families’ safety.

`` Nothing stands as a greater reminder to the Great Sioux Nation of a country that can not keep a promise or treaty than the faces carved into our sacred land on what the United States calls Mount Rushmore , ” Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Harold Frazier said in a statement , according to USA Today .
Frazier also criticized President Trump Donald John TrumpCNN 's Anderson Cooper : Trump 's Bubba Wallace tweet was 'racist , just plain and simple ' Beats by Dre announces deal with Bubba Wallace , defends him after Trump remarks Overnight Defense : DOD reportedly eyeing Confederate flag ban | House military spending bill blocks wall funding MORE ’ s and South Dakota Gov .

`` We are now being forced to witness the lashing of our land with pomp , arrogance and fire hoping our sacred lands survive , '' he said . `` This brand on our flesh needs to be removed and I am willing to do it free of charge to the United States , by myself if I must . ''
Oglala Sioux President Julian Bear Runner has also called for the removal of the monument , which he called “ a great sign of disrespect ” last week .
The federal government initially recognized Sioux ownership of the Black Hills , where the monument is carved , in an 1868 treaty , but the U.S. government seized them in 1876 as part of a series of post-Civil War campaigns against Native Americans after gold was discovered in the Black Hills . A federal court awarded the tribes $ 17.1 million for the territory in 1979 , but the Sioux Nation declined the money rather than give up their claim on the Black Hills .
The monument was carved by artist Gutzon Borglum , a known member of the Ku Klux Klan .
The mountain has long been a flashpoint for Native American activists .

""We are now being forced to witness the lashing of our land with pomp, arrogance and fire hoping our sacred lands survive,"" he said. ""This brand on our flesh needs to be removed and I am willing to do it free of charge to the United States, by myself if I must.""

Oglala Sioux President Julian Bear Runner has also called for the removal of the monument, which he called “a great sign of disrespect” last week.

The federal government initially recognized Sioux ownership of the Black Hills, where the monument is carved, in an 1868 treaty, but the U.S. government seized them in 1876 as part of a series of post-Civil War campaigns against Native Americans after gold was discovered in the Black Hills. A federal court awarded the tribes $17.1 million for the territory in 1979, but the Sioux Nation declined the money rather than give up their claim on the Black Hills.

The monument was carved by artist Gutzon Borglum, a known member of the Ku Klux Klan.

The mountain has long been a flashpoint for Native American activists. In 1971, protesters affiliated with the American Indian Movement occupied the monument and dubbed it “Mount Crazy Horse,” and protesters affiliated with the activist group NDN Collective are set to stage a protest during Trump’s visit this week.

race_and_racism,The Intercept,0,https://theintercept.com/2020/01/20/political-surveillance-police-activists-tennessee/,"In the Face of Rising White Supremacist Violence, Police Continue to Investigate Victims and Activists",2020-01-20,,"I t ’ s been 10 months since someone set an office building on fire at Highlander Research and Education Center , a storied civil rights institution perched in the mountains of northeastern Tennessee , but the investigation into the fire seems to have gone nowhere . The charred remains of the collapsed structure are still untouched , and the yellow tape blocking access to them has only recently come off . In the parking lot next to the destroyed building , a symbol someone spray-painted in black on the concrete the night of the fire is also untouched : It looks like a hashtag , but with three intersecting lines instead of two . That symbol is one used by racist extremists in the U.S. and abroad . It was painted on one of the firearms used by an Australian white supremacist who massacred 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand , just two weeks before the fire at Highlander . The Anti-Defamation League traced the symbol ’ s origins to a Romanian fascist movement dating back to the 1930s and 1940s . But while the symbol is obscure to most , it has resurfaced in connection with the Traditionalist Worker Party , a neo-Nazi group that was active in the U.S. until recently . A year before it was sprayed in the parking lot at Highlander , the symbol was also painted on “ the Rock , ” a boulder at the University of Tennessee ’ s Knoxville campus , not far from Highlander , used by students as a message board . Yet if the symbol was a clue about who might have attacked Highlander , investigators — with the Jefferson County Sheriff ’ s Office ; the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation ; the Tennessee State Fire Marshal ’ s Office ; the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ; and the FBI — have not yet said so publicly .
Nobody was hurt in the March 29 fire in New Market , where Highlander sits on a hilly 200-acre campus with stunning views of the Great Smoky Mountains . But it ’ s not the first time the center has come under attack . For nearly nine decades , Highlander has offered sanctuary to an array of racial , social , and economic justice movements , hosting the likes of Rosa Parks , Ella Baker , Stokely Carmichael , and the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , as well as the activists who wrote the Movement for Black Lives policy platform and immigrant rights and Palestinian solidarity groups . But the center also has a long history of being targeted for harassment and violence by government officials and racist groups . In 1961 , as anti-communist fearmongering gripped the country , the state of Tennessee seized Highlander ’ s land and buildings and revoked its charter ; in 1966 , the Ku Klux Klan firebombed its Knoxville location . After this most recent attack , Highlander staff had few expectations that law enforcement officials investigating the fire would give them answers about who caused it — but they were taken aback by their questions .
When local police arrived on the day of the fire , the first thing they asked Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson , one of Highlander ’ s two co-directors , was “ Are you beefing ? ” “ It was very clear to us that that there was some feeling that we might have done something to instigate this , versus white supremacy instigated this , ” said Henderson , the first black woman to lead the center . “ At that point , I didn ’ t even know what the symbol was or meant , but even when we did realize that it was a symbol of the white power movement , it ’ s not like we ’ re out there doing a tit for tat with them . I ’ m literally in a position where my very existence as a human is the antithesis of what they believe in. ” André Canty , who works in development and communications at Highlander , compared the line of questioning from police after the fire to that following the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 — or that often applied to black victims of police violence . “ What did he do to cause his own death ? ” said Canty . “ You ’ re asking me , why did your abuser abuse you ? Why are racists doing racist things ? ” But as federal investigators joined local police in the months following the fire , the questions posed to Highlander staff grew only more pointed and bizarre , as if they , and not their presumed attackers , were under investigation . “ Who do you train ? ” they were asked . “ Who funds you ? Are you training protesters ? Do you know antifa ? ” “ It was totally an interrogation , ” said Henderson . “ Instead of an investigation that ’ s going to produce information that tells us how we can make ourselves more safe from white supremacist violence , what tends to be true , historically , is that these are opportunities for the state to gather more information about who ’ s coming to Highlander , what they ’ re talking about , what you train them on. ” Asked about those questions , Jason Pack , a special agent with the FBI ’ s field office in Knoxville , wrote to ███ that he was not “ personally aware of those issues , ” but declined to comment further because the investigation is “ ongoing. ” A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office told ███ that it is the office ’ s policy “ to neither confirm or deny the existence of or status of investigations. ” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Coffey did not respond to a request for comment . The Fire Marshal ’ s Office referred questions to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation , which has since taken over fire investigations . A spokesperson for the bureau wrote in a statement to ███ that “ the cause of the fire remains under investigation. ” The ATF did not respond to a request for comment .
Policing Violence vs. Policing Dissent As white supremacists have carried out a growing number of deadly attacks in recent years , the FBI has come under mounting criticism for its failure to address the threat posed by far-right extremist ideologies , whose adherents account for most of the politically motivated violence in the U.S. At the same time , the bureau has also been heavily criticized for devoting large resources to surveilling political dissent by groups and individuals , often of color , who pose no threat but are critical of the government because they oppose official immigration policies or demand police accountability . The FBI ’ s preoccupation with policing nonviolent critical ideologies while neglecting to investigate ideologies tied to real , and increasing , violence was perhaps best captured in an infamous 2017 threat assessment report warning law enforcement agencies of the supposed rise of a “ black identity extremist ” movement targeting police , which the FBI said had emerged on the heels of the Ferguson protests and in response to “ perceived racism and injustice in American society. ” Yet as ███ has reported , and as a number of legislators , activists , and even law enforcement officials have repeatedly pointed out , the black identity extremism category was a product of the FBI ’ s imagination , assembled by cobbling together disparate , isolated incidents with no connection between them other than the race of their perpetrators . For more than a year after the assessment was leaked , the FBI refused to disavow the categorization , even while failing to point to any evidence suggesting that such an ideology existed in reality . Then last year , as the backlash around the label persisted , and as ongoing white supremacist attacks underscored the FBI ’ s seeming double standards , bureau officials told legislators that they were doing away with a set of earlier domestic terrorism categories in favor of four larger ones . The FBI ’ s fictional black identity extremists would now be lumped together with white supremacists under a new “ racially motivated violent extremism ” category . An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story , referring ███ to two congressional hearings in which bureau officials testified on the issue . “ The term I ’ m using is racially motivated violent extremist for the very fact that we ’ re focused on the violence ; we ’ re not focused on the skin of anyone , ” Michael McGarrity , assistant director of the FBI ’ s Counterterrorism Division , said in response to a legislator ’ s question about the FBI ’ s focus on supposed black identity extremists as opposed to white supremacist extremists . “ ‘ Black identity extremist , ’ since I ’ ve been here , we have not used that term , ” added McGarrity , who was appointed to his position in February 2018 . “ But also , you ’ re not hearing me use ‘ white supremacists ’ as a group . I ’ m focused on the violence . … Ideology itself is a First Amendment right . ”
“ It ’ s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country . ”
As ███ noted at the time , that false equivalence made it virtually impossible for the public to know whether the FBI was devoting resources to investigating real threats of racist violence or social and racial justice groups critical of government . And while the FBI ’ s reclassification has already been replicated at the local level — for example , by the New York City Police Department , which recently announced a “ Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism ” unit — civil rights advocates warn that collapsing real and imaginary extremist ideologies risks providing cover for the ongoing targeting of nonviolent activists and activists of color . “ It ’ s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country and to what white supremacy is doing in this country , ” said Henderson . “ Let ’ s just be real : If there ’ s a fear about domestic terror , white men are killing lots of people . And we ’ ve got to figure out how to deal with that. ” Rachel Levinson-Waldman , a senior counsel at the Brennan Center ’ s Liberty & National Security Program , told me that using the “ racially motivated ” umbrella term without distinction “ is a way to both hide the fact that there isn ’ t really black motivated violent extremism and at the same time , to justify the continued investigation . ”
In fact , civil rights advocates have argued against using recent white supremacist attacks to call for more domestic terror laws and mass policing of any ideology , cautioning that trampling on constitutionally protected speech in the absence of criminality or national security threats risks strengthening authoritarian systems that will inevitably blow back on government critics and minorities . But there is a fundamental difference between policing ideas and policing crime and criminal intent . The fire at Highlander , where the investigation of a criminal , violent act appears to have morphed into a broad inquiry into the political work of the victims , offers a troubling example of the obfuscation enabled by the “ racially motivated extremism ” label . “ There was a criminal act and there was presumably criminal planning that led up to it , which is different from surveilling simply on the basis of speech and ideology , ” said Levinson-Waldman . “ The focus on the victims of that act and their political work and organizing is incredibly distressing . It ’ s so backwards , and it ’ s so counterproductive . ”
The Memphis Blacklist While the fire at Highlander remains unsolved almost a year after it occurred , 400 miles away , on the opposite side of the state , a recent lawsuit against the city of Memphis has exposed the lengths to which police will go to surveil the free speech activities of Black Lives Matter and other activists who have committed no crimes . In 2018 , a federal judge in Memphis ruled that the city ’ s police department was in violation of a decades-old federal consent decree prohibiting local law enforcement from gathering “ political intelligence. ” The ruling followed litigation that revealed that Memphis police ’ s Office of Homeland Security , a unit set up following the 9/11 attacks , had engaged in widespread and systemic surveillance of the constitutionally protected activities of individuals protesting , among other things , the killings of black men at the hands of police . The litigation strikingly revealed how the domestic political surveillance efforts ramped up after 9/11 evolved in the post-Ferguson era . It exposed a fake Facebook profile police had created to “ friend ” activists and monitor their discussions and plans . It showed that police had used software designed to comb social media chatter and map connections between individuals based on their digital interactions . It revealed that police had been compiling a series of “ joint intelligence briefs ” on local activists , including pictures , comments , and details about events they planned to attend , which they then distributed as often as three times a day to other law enforcement agencies , including the FBI , the military , and a number of large local businesses , such as FedEx . And the litigation revealed that police had also monitored church services , candlelight vigils , even a black-owned food truck festival and a school supplies giveaway .
The lawsuit itself followed the discovery by local activists of a “ blacklist ” of 84 individuals whom the city had secretly barred from entering City Hall without police escort . The list included some of the city ’ s most vocal organizers , but also some whom police had found to be merely “ associates ” of known protesters , as well as the mother and aunt of Darrius Stewart , a 19-year-old black man killed by Memphis police during a 2015 traffic stop . Keedran Franklin , a 33-year-old activist and organizer , and one of four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said he ’ s always suspected that police were keeping tabs on him , but first had those fears confirmed in early 2017 , when a friend who was working as a security contractor for the city told him that officials “ have a book on y ’ all , ” Franklin recalled . “ They have pictures , known associations , your picture is on the wall . ”
Franklin had first become active in his community by working on violence interruption programs and collaborating with the former mayor ’ s “ guns down ” initiative , but he had become suspicious of the information the city kept on the youth he worked with and grew increasingly skeptical of what he now believes was a surveillance effort masked as community outreach . “ I felt like I was helping them prey on us , ” he told me . Franklin soon started organizing protests and direct actions , first with the Fight for $ 15 campaign to raise the minimum wage and then , after the Ferguson protests and the killing of Stewart in Memphis , against police violence . But Franklin never threatened police or anyone else , he stressed , and Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings even gave him his personal cellphone number after Franklin helped negotiate with police during a protest , offering to help disperse protesters if police promised not to arrest anyone . “ Why would he allow me to have his number if I ’ m this much of a threat ? ” said Franklin . “ It was all political , flat out political . They had no criminal investigations around any of us. ” When the lawsuit yielded dozens of joint intelligence briefs and other internal police documents , Franklin ’ s name , photo , and activities were all over them . “ Keedran Franklin has participated in several demonstrations/protests and is associated with a group called Memphis Coalition of Concerned Citizens , ” reads one of several police documents about Franklin , which also lists other individuals he is “ closely associated with ” and notes that they espouse several causes , such as “ Free Palestine , ” “ Fight for $ 15 , ” and “ Standing Rock . ”
Memphis offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice .
Franklin already knew he was being monitored ; he had been followed by unmarked cars for years , and he often confronted police and livestreamed the exchanges with his phone when he saw them watching him . But the extent of the surveillance revealed in the documents surprised even him : Some memos listed people ’ s height and weight , Social Security numbers , and in one case details of an individual ’ s mental health history . And Franklin realized when he learned of the joint intelligence briefs that a new neighbor who had told him that he looked familiar had been receiving the memos police had written on him and distributed widely . “ I ’ m not this terrorist they are painting me to be , ” he said . “ I got flaws , I ’ m not perfect , but I ’ m no damn terrorist. ” Police surveillance efforts seem to have picked up after Stewart ’ s killing in July 2015 . A year earlier , the protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , had kicked off nationwide rallies against police violence . And a couple of months before Stewart was killed , protests over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore had reignited anger at police , while also putting local and federal law enforcement on high alert . In Memphis , a majority black city where distrust of police runs deep — “ and for good cause , ” as a local lawyer put it — tensions came to a peak on July 10 , 2016 , after the police killings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota , when hundreds of peaceful protesters shut down the Hernando de Soto Bridge that crosses the Mississippi River to connect Tennessee to Arkansas .
That protest — the largest in Memphis ’ s recent history — kicked off a series of others in the following months , and the police department ’ s Homeland Security office , which had previously focused on domestic and international terrorism threats , “ shifted almost entirely to obtaining intelligence about planned large events with the potential for violence against large scale disruption of traffic or commerce , ” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in court filings . In an internal slide made public through the litigation , police even called 2016 “ A Year of Social Unrest Reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s , ” just as they resorted to the surveillance tactics of those years . Through 2016 , officers monitored activists as they protested racist coverage by the local paper , rallied outside Elvis Presley ’ s Graceland mansion , and staged a peaceful “ die-in ” outside the home of Mayor Jim Strickland in December 2016 . It ’ s that die-in in particular that prompted officials to add activists and protesters to the blacklist — or “ escort list , ” as they called it — which up to that point had mostly included former employees or individuals accused of threats or disorderly conduct . The mayor personally authorized the addition to the list of many of the protesters who had lain down in his front yard . Ursula Madden , the chief communications officer for the city of Memphis , challenged the description of the protest as “ peaceful , ” saying that protesters “ showed up at the mayor ’ s home with their faces covered , climbed in the trees on his private property , tried to open the doors to his house and peeked into the windows while his family was inside sleeping—all while recording it on Facebook live and making threatening comments . ”
But both the blacklist and the police intelligence operation directed at protesters violated a 1978 consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that Memphis had entered after it was found to have illegally compiled dossiers on anti-war and student activists through the 1960s and 1970s . While the Justice Department has entered into dozens of such agreements with police departments across the country in an effort to bring them in line with federal civil rights standards , most decrees have focused on excessive force or discriminatory policing . The Memphis consent decree is the only one nationwide that focuses on the issue of political surveillance . And because of the thousands of pages of documents and the public testimony produced by the recent lawsuit , Memphis also offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice . “ Memphis is a microcosm of what we assume is happening across the country , ” said Levinson-Waldman , who serves on a federal monitoring team a judge put in place after he found the city to be in violation of the decree . “ It ’ s the clearest window that we have into what kind of surveillance is going on. ” One Big Plantation In Memphis , no one can possibly forget that the police are watching . If across the country security cameras have become a ubiquitous reality of modern life , whose presence is easy to forget as they blend into the urban landscape , Memphis ’ s cameras light up the city with piercing blue flashes that flicker endlessly from utility poles like thousands of blinking eyes . Memphis ’ s distinctive “ SkyCop ” cameras — more than 2,000 in 500 locations across the city — feed millions of hours of footage a year into the city ’ s Real Time Crime Center . The cameras are another legacy of the war on terror , as officials in Memphis , a major commercial hub , first looked to boost video surveillance capabilities to protect critical infrastructure . In fact , the cameras have largely been used to deter crime , but the lawsuit revealed that they were also used to surveil protesters in violation of the decree . “ It ’ s a police state , for real , ” said Franklin , of the cameras . “ They started taking that equipment and technology and turned it inward , onto us. ” But there are other reminders of police surveillance . Antonio Cathey , another well-known Memphis activist and organizer with Fight for $ 15 , told me that at a turkey giveaway some friends and family had organized before Thanksgiving , police stood at a distance watching people with binoculars . And that ’ s nothing compared to what happened to Cathey in August 2018 , on the very first day of the consent decree trial . Cathey was in court watching the proceedings when his grandmother called to tell him that police had pushed their way into her house and , across the street , that of his uncle .
When Cathey raced there , he found dozens of officers from various agencies , many in riot gear and face masks . The officers had raided the homes and issued his uncle a citation after they found a trace of marijuana in his car ’ s ashtray — not enough to justify an arrest . “ They tore the house completely up , ” said Cathey , adding that he had been terrified for his grandmother . “ I told her , Don ’ t open the door for them . Every guy with a badge and a gun is not a good cop. ” Cathey , who recognized one of the officers from protests he had attended , repeatedly asked police why they were there , but all they told him was , “ We know all about you ” and “ We know exactly who you are. ” A neighbor pointed to a light pole on the street that he said municipal workers had come to fix in the early hours of the morning , even though it didn ’ t appear to be broken . There was a box on the pole with black and yellow tape , and a sign warning , ‘ Danger , don ’ t touch. ’ But Cathey could see a camera lens behind the tape .
That ’ s when it clicked for him that the raid was no coincidence . “ We just had court downtown , ” he said . “ I see what ’ s going on . If they can ’ t get to you , they ’ ll get to your family. ” Madden , the city spokesperson , said in a statement that the incident was “ unrelated ” to the lawsuit . Since then , relatives have told Cathey that they support him but wish he would stop going to protests . “ I ’ m not going to stop doing this , ” he said . “ I have the right to do this , and [ police ] are not going to stop me . If they ’ re looking for something , I ’ m open , it ’ s right on my Facebook page. ” But it ’ s not just activists who are learning to live with a surveillance apparatus they assume to be ubiquitous . Journalists and lawyers in Memphis whisper when they speak in public places . They get suspicious when a car remains behind them after a couple of turns . When I met in a cafe with Wendi C. Thomas , who for years wrote a column for Memphis ’ s largest newspaper before recently starting the independent news organization , MLK50 : Justice Through Journalism , she kept watching her back before asking if we could speak in a more private place . “ I know when I talk to people who aren ’ t from Memphis that I sound crazy , ” she told me . Then , citing a phrase others have used to describe Memphis , she added , “ This place is one big plantation . ”
Thomas , who as the Commercial Appeal ’ s first black female columnist endured years of threats of violence from readers , including death and rape threats , said she discovered the Memphis police had been tracking her social media pages in the middle of the consent decree trial , which she was covering . Thomas was looking down at her notebook when she heard an officer who was testifying about the fake identity he created to friend activists on Facebook read her name out loud , twice , from an exhibit page . “ I looked up and was like , Did he just say my name ? Why would they be monitoring me ? ” she said . Thomas immediately filed a public records request for her name and that of three other female journalists , including the photographer for this story , whose name had come up in testimony . It took the city 433 days to respond . Thomas believes that she and the other journalists came under surveillance because they were in contact with activists . “ I think it speaks to the trust that we have built , intentionally , with activists and organizers , ” she said . “ The fact that you have sources is proof that you ’ re a good journalist . For some of us who have a broad variety of sources , including those in communities that are marginalized , it ’ s proof that we are doing our jobs . But that also makes us a target . If more journalists here in Memphis saw that as part of their job , maybe it would be harder for the city to target all of us . ”
“ The day before the 50th anniversary of King ’ s assassination , they ’ re out there arresting journalists and organizers . ”
There is little question that the targeting is real . As ███ has reported , Memphis police in 2018 arrested undocumented journalist Manuel Duran , who ran a local Spanish-language news site , while he covered a protest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. ’ s assassination in the city . When the charges against Duran were quickly dismissed , instead of releasing him , police turned him over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , who detained him for over a year . While a number of activists were also arrested at the protest , several other reporters who were there were not . And Duran , who was wearing a press badge , appeared to have been singled out . He was well known to local police , which he had covered critically , and in his own video of the incident , an officer can be heard saying , “ Get him , guys ” and pointing in Duran ’ s direction . Then officers grab him even as two activists try to shield him and scream , “ He ’ s a reporter. ” In a statement , the city ’ s spokesperson wrote that “ officers did not know Mr. Duran , or know that he was a member of the media , ” and that he was “ one of many people arrested for blocking traffic. ” “ History doesn ’ t rhyme , but it echoes , ” Thomas said about the episode . “ It ’ s disturbing : The day before the 50th anniversary of King ’ s assassination , they ’ re out there arresting journalists and organizers . ”
Police surveillance continued even in church . Rev . Earle Fisher , a pastor at the city ’ s Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church and an outspoken community leader , said a meeting he hosted at the church after the 2016 bridge protest had also been monitored by police . Fisher said people there had joked about the church being bugged , but he was nonetheless shocked to learn from a local news outlet that his church was one of the spaces that law enforcement was watching after the Tennessee Department of Homeland Security had warned Memphis police that “ gangs , home grown extremists and criminals ” could use legal protests as cover to incite violence . Fisher said that if there was a real threat of violence at the church , police should have told him — but they never did . Fisher first realized how far the city would go to monitor critics when he noticed “ Tennessee Department of Homeland Security ” pop up on his listed Wi-Fi networks at home . Once , after he wrote a public letter to the city ’ s district attorney about the killing of Darrius Stewart , a friend in law enforcement warned him to “ keep his nose clean ” because the DA “ ran his profile to see if anything came up. ” “ If you know anything about history , these types of things are always going to happen , ” said Fisher . Now every time a phone call drops , he just thinks , It must be them . But Fisher added that he and most activists he knows have simply taken note of the surveillance and continued to do the work . “ When you are somebody who has been clearly committed to advocating against an unjust status quo , then you are going to find yourself at odds with any entity that ’ s been constructed to protect the status quo , ” he said . “ I know I ’ m on the right side of history , I know I ’ m doing this for the right reasons , and I know , based on my constitutional rights , that I ’ m doing this the right way . At some point , you just hope it breaks through . ”
A City of Spies Memphis has a long history of both activism and government surveillance . The city was a focal point for the labor and anti-war movements , and it ’ s there that King marched for the last time in a rally in support of a sanitation workers ’ strike in 1968 . At the height of the civil rights movement , around 1965 , the Memphis Police Department established a Domestic Intelligence Unit that began to infiltrate and keep secret dossiers about citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activities , from vigils against the Vietnam War to union efforts . Much like the FBI was doing at the same time under the now-infamous COINTELPRO program , the Memphis Police Department targeted the ACLU , the NAACP , the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and various workers groups . Without warrants , it monitored their mail and phones and kept files on their activities , relationships , and sexual preferences , relying on a network of undercover agents and informants to gather intelligence on unsuspecting individuals . The extent of the DIU ’ s surveillance was finally exposed in the mid-1970s , when Memphis State student Eric Carter discovered his roommate had been an undercover officer . When Carter demanded to see the files police had kept on him , the city incinerated them . As it became clear that officials planned to destroy all evidence of the DIU ’ s work , the ACLU intervened , represented by Memphis civil rights attorney Bruce Kramer , and requested a federal court to stop the city from destroying more evidence . But before the order could be served , Mayor Wyeth Chandler ordered the DIU terminated and “ ten filing cabinets of photographs , reports and documents compiled over a nine-year period … stuffed into garbage bags by DIU staff , taken to city ’ s Scott Street incinerator , doused with fuel and burned , ” according to the ACLU ’ s retelling of the incident . That ’ s when the ACLU filed Kendrick v. Chandler , a class-action lawsuit that in 1978 led to a federal consent decree banning the city of Memphis from “ engaging in law enforcement activities which interfere with any person ’ s rights protected by the First Amendment. ” Even in connection to a criminal investigation , the order continued , “ the City of Memphis must appropriately limit all law enforcement activities so as not to infringe on any person ’ s First Amendment rights. ” Since then , Kramer has periodically checked to make sure that police were abiding by the ban , but it was in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests and the killing of Darrius Stewart that it became evident police were brazenly violating the decree . When activists learned of the blacklist — after one of them showed up at City Hall and was told that he couldn ’ t enter without a police escort — Kramer filed a new lawsuit on behalf of Franklin and three others , accusing the city of violating the Kendrick decree . The ACLU joined the suit after the judge in the case indicated that the four were not part of the original 1976 lawsuit and therefore couldn ’ t bring the claim , an interpretation Kramer vehemently contests .
For Kramer , there is little difference between today ’ s surveillance and what the city of Memphis engaged in half a century ago . “ The basic principles are the same : People have a First Amendment right to protest and a Fourth Amendment right not to have these dossiers kept on them , ” he told me . “ In the ’ 70s , and even before then , in the ’ 60s and ’ 50s and ’ 40s , they were worried about communists , and then they were worried about the Black Panthers , and then they were worried about the Weathermen , and then they were worried about the civil rights people . There is no doubt they fear the activist community — black and white. ” Despite being under federal court orders , the Memphis Police Department never put in place guidelines or training to make sure that officers wouldn ’ t conduct political surveillance . And when attorneys started deposing police as part of the recent litigation , they realized that “ there was a complete ignorance amongst the entire department about the existence of the decree , ” said Thomas Castelli , legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee .
“ I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled . ”
The week before the trial started , the city also filed a motion to modify the terms of the decree , which it argued was written before the internet and surveillance technology and was inapplicable to today ’ s policing methods . After Judge Jon McCalla of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee found the city in contempt of the decree , he brought in a federal monitoring team that ’ s currently in the process of negotiating guidelines , trainings , and an auditing mechanism the police department must follow going forward . But the city has also continued to argue that the decree is obsolete and makes it harder for police to do their job — an argument that McCalla refuted in clear terms last November , when he denied a new request by the city ’ s lawyers to modify the terms of the decree . The decree , McCalla wrote , “ acts as a bulwark , ensuring that the City ’ s surveillance practices do not cross the line from being a powerful weapon in the fight against crime to becoming an intrusive tool that improperly interferes with its residents ’ First Amendment-protected activities . ”
The drawn-out process and the city ’ s apparent backpedaling have frustrated activists , and two recent community meetings held by the monitor have been heated . “ This is not like we ’ re two parties and we have to mediate a fight , ” said Franklin . “ The city administration and police force violated our constitutional rights . They ’ re in the wrong and need to be treated as such . … They still never apologized. ” Franklin , who became a father in November , said he fears that the judge ’ s ruling and the monitoring team won ’ t be enough to stop police from harassing him . “ I don ’ t want my son to be under the scope of Big Brother like a Fred Hampton Jr. , ” he said , referring to the son of Fred Hampton , the young leader of the Black Panthers killed by Chicago police in 1969 . “ I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled . My son should not have to live in fear of that. ” According to Madden , “ the City is complying with the consent decree . However the City has the right to seek modification of the consent decree , which is 40 years old , and is not consistent with best police practices to provide safety in the 21st century. ” In a recent interview about the decree with a local media outlet , Rallings , the police director , also argued that the decree is outdated . “ In 1978 , nobody wore seatbelts , ” said Rallings . “ Well , we learned that seatbelts save lives , so everybody knows it ’ s click it or ticket . So we found that something that was done in the ’ 70s we probably need to go revisit and modify and make it apply to modern police work , and that ’ s all we ’ re asking. ” But Rallings also connected Memphis ’ s surveillance efforts to the warnings local police have been getting from federal law enforcement , particularly following the killings of eight police officers during protests in Dallas and Baton Rouge in 2016 . “ That was a peaceful protest , until a gunman opened fire , ” said Rallings . “ If we think about the number of threats that we are receiving , information from the FBI that individuals were infiltrating peaceful protests and had nefarious intents . … We had an obligation to protect our citizens. ” In fact , documents obtained in discovery show that police were regularly distributing intelligence briefings that compiled news coverage of incidents of violence against police officers in other cities with information gleaned from social media about rallies and actions planned in Memphis — even though there was no connection between them . Other documents show that round-the-clock social media monitoring of Memphis-based activists yielded no evidence that they posed any threat .
“ There ’ s this kind of connotation here , whether they intended that connotation or not , and it ’ s going out to pretty much every cop in the city , ” Castelli said . “ I think it ’ s just indicative of what ’ s going on all over the country with this : law enforcement that is concerning itself more and more with what people are saying , and particularly with what they are saying about law enforcement . … There seems to be a theme , and it fits with the larger antagonism between activists for police reform and the police that are supposed to make sure they can say what they want to say. ” Some activists noted that police surveillance of police critics and protests against police violence was particularly frustrating when compared to police ’ s hands-off treatment of far-right groups that have also rallied in Memphis and across Tennessee . “ One of these is not like the other , ” said Fisher , the pastor . “ But here ’ s a basic thought : Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town . … This is a concrete choice , them saying , ‘ No , we ’ re not going to provide you with the same constitutional rights and privileges as we would provide the Sons of the Confederate Veterans . ’ ”
“ Here ’ s a basic thought : Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town . ”
As it happens , Tennessee has long been a hotbed for the white nationalist movement . “ It seems to be viewed as a friendly place for white supremacists , ” said Castelli . Halfway between Highlander and Memphis is the town of Pulaski , the birthplace of the Klan , and in recent years the state hosted 20 percent of the country ’ s white supremacist gatherings and events , according to the Anti-Defamation League . And while Memphis and the Appalachian mountains where Highlander is located are very different demographically and politically , activists from both communities recognize their experiences as being part of the same criminalization of black dissent in a state that has a long history of both civil rights struggles and white supremacist backlash . “ What ’ s absurd is that they are spending so many resources on that sort of thing across the state in Memphis , a black city , when literally white supremacists are firebombing buildings over here , ” said Highlander ’ s Henderson . “ Why are you surveilling Keedran ? Why are you surveilling me ? What did I do ? If the only answer you have is that we are black and we disagree with the power structures that are harming our communities , then how is this any different than McCarthyism ? How is it different than COINTELPRO ? ”
A History of Harassment Last summer , Henderson and Franklin joined activists from Philadelphia , Minneapolis , and across the country in a delegation to Capitol Hill organized by the racial justice group MediaJustice , which together with the ACLU has been lobbying lawmakers to demand more transparency from the FBI about its surveillance of activists of color . Myaisha Hayes , an organizer with MediaJustice who runs the group ’ s “ protect Black dissent ” campaign , told me that what was happening on opposite sides of Tennessee was exactly what she feared would continue to happen as the FBI collapsed real and imaginary extremist categories into the generic “ racially motivated extremism. ” “ On one side of the state , you ’ ve got people dealing with the police department clearly violating an agreement not to surveil activists , and then a few hours away , you have activists calling for help to investigate an act of hatred , an act of violence , and yet there ’ s no follow-up , ” she said . “ While the government and the police have such a long history of surveilling and criminalizing black folks , they ’ ve really left those same communities vulnerable to white supremacist violence and police violence. ” At Highlander , being targeted for state surveillance and harassment while also coming under threat of violence by white supremacist groups has a long history . At Highlander ’ s workshop center — a red two-story structure where visiting activists and organizers gather for meals and meetings — a series of panels line the walls , describing Highlander ’ s achievements over the decades along with the attacks on the center in those same years . The Highlander Folk School was founded by Myles Horton at Monteagle , Tennessee , in 1932 as a space to organize poor and working people in the South , and from its early days , the school served as a radical space for education , movement building , and desegregation . Through the 1930s and 1940s , Highlander was accused of being “ thoroughly communistic ” and a “ free love ” community . The center lost some of its union partners to the red-baiting and faced a series of bomb threats . The harassment continued through the 1950s as the school was infiltrated and accused of “ fomenting racial strife and disrupting values and institutions of the South. ” Highlander had always promoted interracial solidarity , but through the ’ 50s and ’ 60s , the center was pivotal to the black freedom movement : Highlander organized voter registration workshops and adult literacy programs to fight disenfranchisement . Parks trained at the school months before the Montgomery bus boycott . And it ’ s there that Pete Seeger taught King the reworked lyrics to “ We Shall Overcome. ” In 1961 , following an FBI investigation , Tennessee officials closed the school , took its land , and revoked its charter . The padlocked buildings were burned down shortly after . Highlander relocated to a house in Knoxville and changed its name to the current Highlander Research and Education Center . “ They literally just changed the name and kept doing what they were doing , ” said Henderson . In Knoxville , the harassment continued . In 1963 , an interracial training camp for activists organized by Highlander was raided by police , who arrested 29 people . Days later , someone burned the camp down . In 1966 , after the Klan marched against the center ’ s Knoxville location , someone threw a Molotov cocktail through its window . Highlander moved to its current location in 1972 . “ Highlander was attacked a lot , ” said Susan Williams , a coordinator at the center ’ s library who has been with the organization for more than 30 years . “ How it still exists is kind of a miracle . ”","I t’s been 10 months since someone set an office building on fire at Highlander Research and Education Center, a storied civil rights institution perched in the mountains of northeastern Tennessee, but the investigation into the fire seems to have gone nowhere. The charred remains of the collapsed structure are still untouched, and the yellow tape blocking access to them has only recently come off. In the parking lot next to the destroyed building, a symbol someone spray-painted in black on the concrete the night of the fire is also untouched: It looks like a hashtag, but with three intersecting lines instead of two. That symbol is one used by racist extremists in the U.S. and abroad. It was painted on one of the firearms used by an Australian white supremacist who massacred 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, just two weeks before the fire at Highlander. The Anti-Defamation League traced the symbol’s origins to a Romanian fascist movement dating back to the 1930s and 1940s. But while the symbol is obscure to most, it has resurfaced in connection with the Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi group that was active in the U.S. until recently. A year before it was sprayed in the parking lot at Highlander, the symbol was also painted on “the Rock,” a boulder at the University of Tennessee’s Knoxville campus, not far from Highlander, used by students as a message board. Yet if the symbol was a clue about who might have attacked Highlander, investigators — with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office; the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation; the Tennessee State Fire Marshal’s Office; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the FBI — have not yet said so publicly.

Nobody was hurt in the March 29 fire in New Market, where Highlander sits on a hilly 200-acre campus with stunning views of the Great Smoky Mountains. But it’s not the first time the center has come under attack. For nearly nine decades, Highlander has offered sanctuary to an array of racial, social, and economic justice movements, hosting the likes of Rosa Parks, Ella Baker, Stokely Carmichael, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the activists who wrote the Movement for Black Lives policy platform and immigrant rights and Palestinian solidarity groups. But the center also has a long history of being targeted for harassment and violence by government officials and racist groups. In 1961, as anti-communist fearmongering gripped the country, the state of Tennessee seized Highlander’s land and buildings and revoked its charter; in 1966, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed its Knoxville location. After this most recent attack, Highlander staff had few expectations that law enforcement officials investigating the fire would give them answers about who caused it — but they were taken aback by their questions.

When local police arrived on the day of the fire, the first thing they asked Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, one of Highlander’s two co-directors, was “Are you beefing?” “It was very clear to us that that there was some feeling that we might have done something to instigate this, versus white supremacy instigated this,” said Henderson, the first black woman to lead the center. “At that point, I didn’t even know what the symbol was or meant, but even when we did realize that it was a symbol of the white power movement, it’s not like we’re out there doing a tit for tat with them. I’m literally in a position where my very existence as a human is the antithesis of what they believe in.” André Canty, who works in development and communications at Highlander, compared the line of questioning from police after the fire to that following the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 — or that often applied to black victims of police violence. “What did he do to cause his own death?” said Canty. “You’re asking me, why did your abuser abuse you? Why are racists doing racist things?” But as federal investigators joined local police in the months following the fire, the questions posed to Highlander staff grew only more pointed and bizarre, as if they, and not their presumed attackers, were under investigation. “Who do you train?” they were asked. “Who funds you? Are you training protesters? Do you know antifa?” “It was totally an interrogation,” said Henderson. “Instead of an investigation that’s going to produce information that tells us how we can make ourselves more safe from white supremacist violence, what tends to be true, historically, is that these are opportunities for the state to gather more information about who’s coming to Highlander, what they’re talking about, what you train them on.” Asked about those questions, Jason Pack, a special agent with the FBI’s field office in Knoxville, wrote to The Intercept that he was not “personally aware of those issues,” but declined to comment further because the investigation is “ongoing.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office told The Intercept that it is the office’s policy “to neither confirm or deny the existence of or status of investigations.” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Coffey did not respond to a request for comment. The Fire Marshal’s Office referred questions to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which has since taken over fire investigations. A spokesperson for the bureau wrote in a statement to The Intercept that “the cause of the fire remains under investigation.” The ATF did not respond to a request for comment.

Policing Violence vs. Policing Dissent As white supremacists have carried out a growing number of deadly attacks in recent years, the FBI has come under mounting criticism for its failure to address the threat posed by far-right extremist ideologies, whose adherents account for most of the politically motivated violence in the U.S. At the same time, the bureau has also been heavily criticized for devoting large resources to surveilling political dissent by groups and individuals, often of color, who pose no threat but are critical of the government because they oppose official immigration policies or demand police accountability. The FBI’s preoccupation with policing nonviolent critical ideologies while neglecting to investigate ideologies tied to real, and increasing, violence was perhaps best captured in an infamous 2017 threat assessment report warning law enforcement agencies of the supposed rise of a “black identity extremist” movement targeting police, which the FBI said had emerged on the heels of the Ferguson protests and in response to “perceived racism and injustice in American society.” Yet as The Intercept has reported, and as a number of legislators, activists, and even law enforcement officials have repeatedly pointed out, the black identity extremism category was a product of the FBI’s imagination, assembled by cobbling together disparate, isolated incidents with no connection between them other than the race of their perpetrators. For more than a year after the assessment was leaked, the FBI refused to disavow the categorization, even while failing to point to any evidence suggesting that such an ideology existed in reality. Then last year, as the backlash around the label persisted, and as ongoing white supremacist attacks underscored the FBI’s seeming double standards, bureau officials told legislators that they were doing away with a set of earlier domestic terrorism categories in favor of four larger ones. The FBI’s fictional black identity extremists would now be lumped together with white supremacists under a new “racially motivated violent extremism” category. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story, referring The Intercept to two congressional hearings in which bureau officials testified on the issue. “The term I’m using is racially motivated violent extremist for the very fact that we’re focused on the violence; we’re not focused on the skin of anyone,” Michael McGarrity, assistant director of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, said in response to a legislator’s question about the FBI’s focus on supposed black identity extremists as opposed to white supremacist extremists. “‘Black identity extremist,’ since I’ve been here, we have not used that term,” added McGarrity, who was appointed to his position in February 2018. “But also, you’re not hearing me use ‘white supremacists’ as a group. I’m focused on the violence. … Ideology itself is a First Amendment right.”

“It’s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country.”

As The Intercept noted at the time, that false equivalence made it virtually impossible for the public to know whether the FBI was devoting resources to investigating real threats of racist violence or social and racial justice groups critical of government. And while the FBI’s reclassification has already been replicated at the local level — for example, by the New York City Police Department, which recently announced a “Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism” unit — civil rights advocates warn that collapsing real and imaginary extremist ideologies risks providing cover for the ongoing targeting of nonviolent activists and activists of color. “It’s egregious to compare black dissent to what white nationalists are doing in this country and to what white supremacy is doing in this country,” said Henderson. “Let’s just be real: If there’s a fear about domestic terror, white men are killing lots of people. And we’ve got to figure out how to deal with that.” Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security Program, told me that using the “racially motivated” umbrella term without distinction “is a way to both hide the fact that there isn’t really black motivated violent extremism and at the same time, to justify the continued investigation.”

In fact, civil rights advocates have argued against using recent white supremacist attacks to call for more domestic terror laws and mass policing of any ideology, cautioning that trampling on constitutionally protected speech in the absence of criminality or national security threats risks strengthening authoritarian systems that will inevitably blow back on government critics and minorities. But there is a fundamental difference between policing ideas and policing crime and criminal intent. The fire at Highlander, where the investigation of a criminal, violent act appears to have morphed into a broad inquiry into the political work of the victims, offers a troubling example of the obfuscation enabled by the “racially motivated extremism” label. “There was a criminal act and there was presumably criminal planning that led up to it, which is different from surveilling simply on the basis of speech and ideology,” said Levinson-Waldman. “The focus on the victims of that act and their political work and organizing is incredibly distressing. It’s so backwards, and it’s so counterproductive.”

The Memphis Blacklist While the fire at Highlander remains unsolved almost a year after it occurred, 400 miles away, on the opposite side of the state, a recent lawsuit against the city of Memphis has exposed the lengths to which police will go to surveil the free speech activities of Black Lives Matter and other activists who have committed no crimes. In 2018, a federal judge in Memphis ruled that the city’s police department was in violation of a decades-old federal consent decree prohibiting local law enforcement from gathering “political intelligence.” The ruling followed litigation that revealed that Memphis police’s Office of Homeland Security, a unit set up following the 9/11 attacks, had engaged in widespread and systemic surveillance of the constitutionally protected activities of individuals protesting, among other things, the killings of black men at the hands of police. The litigation strikingly revealed how the domestic political surveillance efforts ramped up after 9/11 evolved in the post-Ferguson era. It exposed a fake Facebook profile police had created to “friend” activists and monitor their discussions and plans. It showed that police had used software designed to comb social media chatter and map connections between individuals based on their digital interactions. It revealed that police had been compiling a series of “joint intelligence briefs” on local activists, including pictures, comments, and details about events they planned to attend, which they then distributed as often as three times a day to other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the military, and a number of large local businesses, such as FedEx. And the litigation revealed that police had also monitored church services, candlelight vigils, even a black-owned food truck festival and a school supplies giveaway.

The lawsuit itself followed the discovery by local activists of a “blacklist” of 84 individuals whom the city had secretly barred from entering City Hall without police escort. The list included some of the city’s most vocal organizers, but also some whom police had found to be merely “associates” of known protesters, as well as the mother and aunt of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old black man killed by Memphis police during a 2015 traffic stop. Keedran Franklin, a 33-year-old activist and organizer, and one of four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said he’s always suspected that police were keeping tabs on him, but first had those fears confirmed in early 2017, when a friend who was working as a security contractor for the city told him that officials “have a book on y’all,” Franklin recalled. “They have pictures, known associations, your picture is on the wall.”

Franklin had first become active in his community by working on violence interruption programs and collaborating with the former mayor’s “guns down” initiative, but he had become suspicious of the information the city kept on the youth he worked with and grew increasingly skeptical of what he now believes was a surveillance effort masked as community outreach. “I felt like I was helping them prey on us,” he told me. Franklin soon started organizing protests and direct actions, first with the Fight for $15 campaign to raise the minimum wage and then, after the Ferguson protests and the killing of Stewart in Memphis, against police violence. But Franklin never threatened police or anyone else, he stressed, and Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings even gave him his personal cellphone number after Franklin helped negotiate with police during a protest, offering to help disperse protesters if police promised not to arrest anyone. “Why would he allow me to have his number if I’m this much of a threat?” said Franklin. “It was all political, flat out political. They had no criminal investigations around any of us.” When the lawsuit yielded dozens of joint intelligence briefs and other internal police documents, Franklin’s name, photo, and activities were all over them. “Keedran Franklin has participated in several demonstrations/protests and is associated with a group called Memphis Coalition of Concerned Citizens,” reads one of several police documents about Franklin, which also lists other individuals he is “closely associated with” and notes that they espouse several causes, such as “Free Palestine,” “Fight for $15,” and “Standing Rock.”

Memphis offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice.

Franklin already knew he was being monitored; he had been followed by unmarked cars for years, and he often confronted police and livestreamed the exchanges with his phone when he saw them watching him. But the extent of the surveillance revealed in the documents surprised even him: Some memos listed people’s height and weight, Social Security numbers, and in one case details of an individual’s mental health history. And Franklin realized when he learned of the joint intelligence briefs that a new neighbor who had told him that he looked familiar had been receiving the memos police had written on him and distributed widely. “I’m not this terrorist they are painting me to be,” he said. “I got flaws, I’m not perfect, but I’m no damn terrorist.” Police surveillance efforts seem to have picked up after Stewart’s killing in July 2015. A year earlier, the protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, had kicked off nationwide rallies against police violence. And a couple of months before Stewart was killed, protests over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore had reignited anger at police, while also putting local and federal law enforcement on high alert. In Memphis, a majority black city where distrust of police runs deep — “and for good cause,” as a local lawyer put it — tensions came to a peak on July 10, 2016, after the police killings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, when hundreds of peaceful protesters shut down the Hernando de Soto Bridge that crosses the Mississippi River to connect Tennessee to Arkansas.

That protest — the largest in Memphis’s recent history — kicked off a series of others in the following months, and the police department’s Homeland Security office, which had previously focused on domestic and international terrorism threats, “shifted almost entirely to obtaining intelligence about planned large events with the potential for violence against large scale disruption of traffic or commerce,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in court filings. In an internal slide made public through the litigation, police even called 2016 “A Year of Social Unrest Reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s,” just as they resorted to the surveillance tactics of those years. Through 2016, officers monitored activists as they protested racist coverage by the local paper, rallied outside Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion, and staged a peaceful “die-in” outside the home of Mayor Jim Strickland in December 2016. It’s that die-in in particular that prompted officials to add activists and protesters to the blacklist — or “escort list,” as they called it — which up to that point had mostly included former employees or individuals accused of threats or disorderly conduct. The mayor personally authorized the addition to the list of many of the protesters who had lain down in his front yard. Ursula Madden, the chief communications officer for the city of Memphis, challenged the description of the protest as “peaceful,” saying that protesters “showed up at the mayor’s home with their faces covered, climbed in the trees on his private property, tried to open the doors to his house and peeked into the windows while his family was inside sleeping—all while recording it on Facebook live and making threatening comments.”

But both the blacklist and the police intelligence operation directed at protesters violated a 1978 consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that Memphis had entered after it was found to have illegally compiled dossiers on anti-war and student activists through the 1960s and 1970s. While the Justice Department has entered into dozens of such agreements with police departments across the country in an effort to bring them in line with federal civil rights standards, most decrees have focused on excessive force or discriminatory policing. The Memphis consent decree is the only one nationwide that focuses on the issue of political surveillance. And because of the thousands of pages of documents and the public testimony produced by the recent lawsuit, Memphis also offers the most detailed picture we have of what domestic political surveillance looks like in practice. “Memphis is a microcosm of what we assume is happening across the country,” said Levinson-Waldman, who serves on a federal monitoring team a judge put in place after he found the city to be in violation of the decree. “It’s the clearest window that we have into what kind of surveillance is going on.” One Big Plantation In Memphis, no one can possibly forget that the police are watching. If across the country security cameras have become a ubiquitous reality of modern life, whose presence is easy to forget as they blend into the urban landscape, Memphis’s cameras light up the city with piercing blue flashes that flicker endlessly from utility poles like thousands of blinking eyes. Memphis’s distinctive “SkyCop” cameras — more than 2,000 in 500 locations across the city — feed millions of hours of footage a year into the city’s Real Time Crime Center. The cameras are another legacy of the war on terror, as officials in Memphis, a major commercial hub, first looked to boost video surveillance capabilities to protect critical infrastructure. In fact, the cameras have largely been used to deter crime, but the lawsuit revealed that they were also used to surveil protesters in violation of the decree. “It’s a police state, for real,” said Franklin, of the cameras. “They started taking that equipment and technology and turned it inward, onto us.” But there are other reminders of police surveillance. Antonio Cathey, another well-known Memphis activist and organizer with Fight for $15, told me that at a turkey giveaway some friends and family had organized before Thanksgiving, police stood at a distance watching people with binoculars. And that’s nothing compared to what happened to Cathey in August 2018, on the very first day of the consent decree trial. Cathey was in court watching the proceedings when his grandmother called to tell him that police had pushed their way into her house and, across the street, that of his uncle.

When Cathey raced there, he found dozens of officers from various agencies, many in riot gear and face masks. The officers had raided the homes and issued his uncle a citation after they found a trace of marijuana in his car’s ashtray — not enough to justify an arrest. “They tore the house completely up,” said Cathey, adding that he had been terrified for his grandmother. “I told her, Don’t open the door for them. Every guy with a badge and a gun is not a good cop.” Cathey, who recognized one of the officers from protests he had attended, repeatedly asked police why they were there, but all they told him was, “We know all about you” and “We know exactly who you are.” A neighbor pointed to a light pole on the street that he said municipal workers had come to fix in the early hours of the morning, even though it didn’t appear to be broken. There was a box on the pole with black and yellow tape, and a sign warning, ‘Danger, don’t touch.’ But Cathey could see a camera lens behind the tape.

That’s when it clicked for him that the raid was no coincidence. “We just had court downtown,” he said. “I see what’s going on. If they can’t get to you, they’ll get to your family.” Madden, the city spokesperson, said in a statement that the incident was “unrelated” to the lawsuit. Since then, relatives have told Cathey that they support him but wish he would stop going to protests. “I’m not going to stop doing this,” he said. “I have the right to do this, and [police] are not going to stop me. If they’re looking for something, I’m open, it’s right on my Facebook page.” But it’s not just activists who are learning to live with a surveillance apparatus they assume to be ubiquitous. Journalists and lawyers in Memphis whisper when they speak in public places. They get suspicious when a car remains behind them after a couple of turns. When I met in a cafe with Wendi C. Thomas, who for years wrote a column for Memphis’s largest newspaper before recently starting the independent news organization, MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, she kept watching her back before asking if we could speak in a more private place. “I know when I talk to people who aren’t from Memphis that I sound crazy,” she told me. Then, citing a phrase others have used to describe Memphis, she added, “This place is one big plantation.”

Thomas, who as the Commercial Appeal’s first black female columnist endured years of threats of violence from readers, including death and rape threats, said she discovered the Memphis police had been tracking her social media pages in the middle of the consent decree trial, which she was covering. Thomas was looking down at her notebook when she heard an officer who was testifying about the fake identity he created to friend activists on Facebook read her name out loud, twice, from an exhibit page. “I looked up and was like, Did he just say my name? Why would they be monitoring me?” she said. Thomas immediately filed a public records request for her name and that of three other female journalists, including the photographer for this story, whose name had come up in testimony. It took the city 433 days to respond. Thomas believes that she and the other journalists came under surveillance because they were in contact with activists. “I think it speaks to the trust that we have built, intentionally, with activists and organizers,” she said. “The fact that you have sources is proof that you’re a good journalist. For some of us who have a broad variety of sources, including those in communities that are marginalized, it’s proof that we are doing our jobs. But that also makes us a target. If more journalists here in Memphis saw that as part of their job, maybe it would be harder for the city to target all of us.”

“The day before the 50th anniversary of King’s assassination, they’re out there arresting journalists and organizers.”

There is little question that the targeting is real. As The Intercept has reported, Memphis police in 2018 arrested undocumented journalist Manuel Duran, who ran a local Spanish-language news site, while he covered a protest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in the city. When the charges against Duran were quickly dismissed, instead of releasing him, police turned him over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who detained him for over a year. While a number of activists were also arrested at the protest, several other reporters who were there were not. And Duran, who was wearing a press badge, appeared to have been singled out. He was well known to local police, which he had covered critically, and in his own video of the incident, an officer can be heard saying, “Get him, guys” and pointing in Duran’s direction. Then officers grab him even as two activists try to shield him and scream, “He’s a reporter.” In a statement, the city’s spokesperson wrote that “officers did not know Mr. Duran, or know that he was a member of the media,” and that he was “one of many people arrested for blocking traffic.” “History doesn’t rhyme, but it echoes,” Thomas said about the episode. “It’s disturbing: The day before the 50th anniversary of King’s assassination, they’re out there arresting journalists and organizers.”

Police surveillance continued even in church. Rev. Earle Fisher, a pastor at the city’s Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church and an outspoken community leader, said a meeting he hosted at the church after the 2016 bridge protest had also been monitored by police. Fisher said people there had joked about the church being bugged, but he was nonetheless shocked to learn from a local news outlet that his church was one of the spaces that law enforcement was watching after the Tennessee Department of Homeland Security had warned Memphis police that “gangs, home grown extremists and criminals” could use legal protests as cover to incite violence. Fisher said that if there was a real threat of violence at the church, police should have told him — but they never did. Fisher first realized how far the city would go to monitor critics when he noticed “Tennessee Department of Homeland Security” pop up on his listed Wi-Fi networks at home. Once, after he wrote a public letter to the city’s district attorney about the killing of Darrius Stewart, a friend in law enforcement warned him to “keep his nose clean” because the DA “ran his profile to see if anything came up.” “If you know anything about history, these types of things are always going to happen,” said Fisher. Now every time a phone call drops, he just thinks, It must be them. But Fisher added that he and most activists he knows have simply taken note of the surveillance and continued to do the work. “When you are somebody who has been clearly committed to advocating against an unjust status quo, then you are going to find yourself at odds with any entity that’s been constructed to protect the status quo,” he said. “I know I’m on the right side of history, I know I’m doing this for the right reasons, and I know, based on my constitutional rights, that I’m doing this the right way. At some point, you just hope it breaks through.”

A City of Spies Memphis has a long history of both activism and government surveillance. The city was a focal point for the labor and anti-war movements, and it’s there that King marched for the last time in a rally in support of a sanitation workers’ strike in 1968. At the height of the civil rights movement, around 1965, the Memphis Police Department established a Domestic Intelligence Unit that began to infiltrate and keep secret dossiers about citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activities, from vigils against the Vietnam War to union efforts. Much like the FBI was doing at the same time under the now-infamous COINTELPRO program, the Memphis Police Department targeted the ACLU, the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and various workers groups. Without warrants, it monitored their mail and phones and kept files on their activities, relationships, and sexual preferences, relying on a network of undercover agents and informants to gather intelligence on unsuspecting individuals. The extent of the DIU’s surveillance was finally exposed in the mid-1970s, when Memphis State student Eric Carter discovered his roommate had been an undercover officer. When Carter demanded to see the files police had kept on him, the city incinerated them. As it became clear that officials planned to destroy all evidence of the DIU’s work, the ACLU intervened, represented by Memphis civil rights attorney Bruce Kramer, and requested a federal court to stop the city from destroying more evidence. But before the order could be served, Mayor Wyeth Chandler ordered the DIU terminated and “ten filing cabinets of photographs, reports and documents compiled over a nine-year period … stuffed into garbage bags by DIU staff, taken to city’s Scott Street incinerator, doused with fuel and burned,” according to the ACLU’s retelling of the incident. That’s when the ACLU filed Kendrick v. Chandler, a class-action lawsuit that in 1978 led to a federal consent decree banning the city of Memphis from “engaging in law enforcement activities which interfere with any person’s rights protected by the First Amendment.” Even in connection to a criminal investigation, the order continued, “the City of Memphis must appropriately limit all law enforcement activities so as not to infringe on any person’s First Amendment rights.” Since then, Kramer has periodically checked to make sure that police were abiding by the ban, but it was in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests and the killing of Darrius Stewart that it became evident police were brazenly violating the decree. When activists learned of the blacklist — after one of them showed up at City Hall and was told that he couldn’t enter without a police escort — Kramer filed a new lawsuit on behalf of Franklin and three others, accusing the city of violating the Kendrick decree. The ACLU joined the suit after the judge in the case indicated that the four were not part of the original 1976 lawsuit and therefore couldn’t bring the claim, an interpretation Kramer vehemently contests.

For Kramer, there is little difference between today’s surveillance and what the city of Memphis engaged in half a century ago. “The basic principles are the same: People have a First Amendment right to protest and a Fourth Amendment right not to have these dossiers kept on them,” he told me. “In the ’70s, and even before then, in the ’60s and ’50s and ’40s, they were worried about communists, and then they were worried about the Black Panthers, and then they were worried about the Weathermen, and then they were worried about the civil rights people. There is no doubt they fear the activist community — black and white.” Despite being under federal court orders, the Memphis Police Department never put in place guidelines or training to make sure that officers wouldn’t conduct political surveillance. And when attorneys started deposing police as part of the recent litigation, they realized that “there was a complete ignorance amongst the entire department about the existence of the decree,” said Thomas Castelli, legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee.

“I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled.”

The week before the trial started, the city also filed a motion to modify the terms of the decree, which it argued was written before the internet and surveillance technology and was inapplicable to today’s policing methods. After Judge Jon McCalla of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee found the city in contempt of the decree, he brought in a federal monitoring team that’s currently in the process of negotiating guidelines, trainings, and an auditing mechanism the police department must follow going forward. But the city has also continued to argue that the decree is obsolete and makes it harder for police to do their job — an argument that McCalla refuted in clear terms last November, when he denied a new request by the city’s lawyers to modify the terms of the decree. The decree, McCalla wrote, “acts as a bulwark, ensuring that the City’s surveillance practices do not cross the line from being a powerful weapon in the fight against crime to becoming an intrusive tool that improperly interferes with its residents’ First Amendment-protected activities.”

The drawn-out process and the city’s apparent backpedaling have frustrated activists, and two recent community meetings held by the monitor have been heated. “This is not like we’re two parties and we have to mediate a fight,” said Franklin. “The city administration and police force violated our constitutional rights. They’re in the wrong and need to be treated as such. … They still never apologized.” Franklin, who became a father in November, said he fears that the judge’s ruling and the monitoring team won’t be enough to stop police from harassing him. “I don’t want my son to be under the scope of Big Brother like a Fred Hampton Jr.,” he said, referring to the son of Fred Hampton, the young leader of the Black Panthers killed by Chicago police in 1969. “I should not have to live in fear of me and my son being surveilled. My son should not have to live in fear of that.” According to Madden, “the City is complying with the consent decree. However the City has the right to seek modification of the consent decree, which is 40 years old, and is not consistent with best police practices to provide safety in the 21st century.” In a recent interview about the decree with a local media outlet, Rallings, the police director, also argued that the decree is outdated. “In 1978, nobody wore seatbelts,” said Rallings. “Well, we learned that seatbelts save lives, so everybody knows it’s click it or ticket. So we found that something that was done in the ’70s we probably need to go revisit and modify and make it apply to modern police work, and that’s all we’re asking.” But Rallings also connected Memphis’s surveillance efforts to the warnings local police have been getting from federal law enforcement, particularly following the killings of eight police officers during protests in Dallas and Baton Rouge in 2016. “That was a peaceful protest, until a gunman opened fire,” said Rallings. “If we think about the number of threats that we are receiving, information from the FBI that individuals were infiltrating peaceful protests and had nefarious intents. … We had an obligation to protect our citizens.” In fact, documents obtained in discovery show that police were regularly distributing intelligence briefings that compiled news coverage of incidents of violence against police officers in other cities with information gleaned from social media about rallies and actions planned in Memphis — even though there was no connection between them. Other documents show that round-the-clock social media monitoring of Memphis-based activists yielded no evidence that they posed any threat.

“There’s this kind of connotation here, whether they intended that connotation or not, and it’s going out to pretty much every cop in the city,” Castelli said. “I think it’s just indicative of what’s going on all over the country with this: law enforcement that is concerning itself more and more with what people are saying, and particularly with what they are saying about law enforcement. … There seems to be a theme, and it fits with the larger antagonism between activists for police reform and the police that are supposed to make sure they can say what they want to say.” Some activists noted that police surveillance of police critics and protests against police violence was particularly frustrating when compared to police’s hands-off treatment of far-right groups that have also rallied in Memphis and across Tennessee. “One of these is not like the other,” said Fisher, the pastor. “But here’s a basic thought: Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town. … This is a concrete choice, them saying, ‘No, we’re not going to provide you with the same constitutional rights and privileges as we would provide the Sons of the Confederate Veterans.’”

“Here’s a basic thought: Treat us the same way you treat the white supremacists when they come to town.”

As it happens, Tennessee has long been a hotbed for the white nationalist movement. “It seems to be viewed as a friendly place for white supremacists,” said Castelli. Halfway between Highlander and Memphis is the town of Pulaski, the birthplace of the Klan, and in recent years the state hosted 20 percent of the country’s white supremacist gatherings and events, according to the Anti-Defamation League. And while Memphis and the Appalachian mountains where Highlander is located are very different demographically and politically, activists from both communities recognize their experiences as being part of the same criminalization of black dissent in a state that has a long history of both civil rights struggles and white supremacist backlash. “What’s absurd is that they are spending so many resources on that sort of thing across the state in Memphis, a black city, when literally white supremacists are firebombing buildings over here,” said Highlander’s Henderson. “Why are you surveilling Keedran? Why are you surveilling me? What did I do? If the only answer you have is that we are black and we disagree with the power structures that are harming our communities, then how is this any different than McCarthyism? How is it different than COINTELPRO?”

A History of Harassment Last summer, Henderson and Franklin joined activists from Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and across the country in a delegation to Capitol Hill organized by the racial justice group MediaJustice, which together with the ACLU has been lobbying lawmakers to demand more transparency from the FBI about its surveillance of activists of color. Myaisha Hayes, an organizer with MediaJustice who runs the group’s “protect Black dissent” campaign, told me that what was happening on opposite sides of Tennessee was exactly what she feared would continue to happen as the FBI collapsed real and imaginary extremist categories into the generic “racially motivated extremism.” “On one side of the state, you’ve got people dealing with the police department clearly violating an agreement not to surveil activists, and then a few hours away, you have activists calling for help to investigate an act of hatred, an act of violence, and yet there’s no follow-up,” she said. “While the government and the police have such a long history of surveilling and criminalizing black folks, they’ve really left those same communities vulnerable to white supremacist violence and police violence.” At Highlander, being targeted for state surveillance and harassment while also coming under threat of violence by white supremacist groups has a long history. At Highlander’s workshop center — a red two-story structure where visiting activists and organizers gather for meals and meetings — a series of panels line the walls, describing Highlander’s achievements over the decades along with the attacks on the center in those same years. The Highlander Folk School was founded by Myles Horton at Monteagle, Tennessee, in 1932 as a space to organize poor and working people in the South, and from its early days, the school served as a radical space for education, movement building, and desegregation. Through the 1930s and 1940s, Highlander was accused of being “thoroughly communistic” and a “free love” community. The center lost some of its union partners to the red-baiting and faced a series of bomb threats. The harassment continued through the 1950s as the school was infiltrated and accused of “fomenting racial strife and disrupting values and institutions of the South.” Highlander had always promoted interracial solidarity, but through the ’50s and ’60s, the center was pivotal to the black freedom movement: Highlander organized voter registration workshops and adult literacy programs to fight disenfranchisement. Parks trained at the school months before the Montgomery bus boycott. And it’s there that Pete Seeger taught King the reworked lyrics to “We Shall Overcome.” In 1961, following an FBI investigation, Tennessee officials closed the school, took its land, and revoked its charter. The padlocked buildings were burned down shortly after. Highlander relocated to a house in Knoxville and changed its name to the current Highlander Research and Education Center. “They literally just changed the name and kept doing what they were doing,” said Henderson. In Knoxville, the harassment continued. In 1963, an interracial training camp for activists organized by Highlander was raided by police, who arrested 29 people. Days later, someone burned the camp down. In 1966, after the Klan marched against the center’s Knoxville location, someone threw a Molotov cocktail through its window. Highlander moved to its current location in 1972. “Highlander was attacked a lot,” said Susan Williams, a coordinator at the center’s library who has been with the organization for more than 30 years. “How it still exists is kind of a miracle.”

We made Ferguson because our choices reinforce racial and class divisions that manifest not only in cultures and attitudes, but also in schools, neighborhoods, churches and businesses.

Many of us do not live in large urban areas. But we, too, made Ferguson because we're complicit in a system of criminal justice that disproportionately harms black men, and therefore, the black community. We made Ferguson because we do not address the vast and growing injustices for America's poor -- black and white.

We made Ferguson because too many of us would rather tweet than get involved in the messiness of local politics and community building. The hard work of solving problems doesn't happen from hashtag campaigns or writing blog posts and articles -- like this one.

We made Ferguson because we have more tolerance for riots after sporting events than for citizens protesting injustice. We stand by and watch the government's most egregious violations of our First Amendment rights when the protests are about the things that matter most. And that's true not only of the initial police response to Ferguson, but also of the restrictions placed on many of the Occupy demonstrations, on some labor protests and in many other instances of political and religious dissent in recent years.

Ferguson does not have any easy solutions. But we need to begin by talking about the problems in a more honest and self-reflective way. We need to start having the tough conversations that many of us too often avoid out of fear, ignorance or inconvenience.

Some of us have been engaged in these conversations for a long time. But many of us, especially many people whose lives and neighborhoods and workplaces look a lot like mine, have not yet begun. Whether we've already been talking or are just about to start, we need to risk awkwardness and misunderstanding as we stumble toward dialogue. And we need to extend grace to one another as we take those risks.

But we can't just talk. We need to be willing to share time and experiences that lead to friendships, not just conversation partners.

We might look to Ferguson to see what else must come next: learning about the issues, better supporting local businesses and nonprofits, expanding voter registration and voter education, monitoring local courtrooms and bureaucrats and holding accountable those officials who have used their power for harm rather than for good.

We can do these things after the cameras go away and where the cameras have never been.

We may not all put bodies on the line for the largely peaceful demonstrations. But we can put them on the line in the months and years to come -- by choosing to engage in the slow and difficult work of restoring communities.

We owe at least that much to Ferguson and to all the Fergusons across our country.

Staff Said Administrators Impeded an Investigation.,,,"███ is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power . Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published . This article was produced in partnership with New Mexico In Depth , which is a member of the ███ Local Reporting Network .
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. — Federal regulators are ramping up scrutiny of a prominent women ’ s hospital here after clinicians ’ allegations that Native Americans had been racially profiled for extra COVID-19 screening , leading to the temporary separation of some mothers from their newborns .
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will refer findings from state investigators about a violation of patient rights at Lovelace Women ’ s Hospital to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ’ Office for Civil Rights , state officials said . The state Department of Health declined to specify details of the violations it had found .
The HHS Office for Civil Rights enforces federal laws banning discrimination in the provision of medical care and investigates violations of patient privacy rights .
“ The allegations against Lovelace Women ’ s Hospital are very serious , ” said New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Kathyleen Kunkel . The department “ continues to be concerned that individuals will not access the medical care they need and are entitled to due to fear or mistrust . ”
The state and federal actions were announced after an investigation by New Mexico In Depth and ███ found that Lovelace had a secret policy of designating Native American women as under investigation for coronavirus based on their appearance and a list of ZIP codes , regardless of their symptoms . The ZIP code list , known informally as the “ Pueblos List , ” a reference to New Mexico ’ s 19 Pueblo tribes , contained ZIP codes that corresponded with tribal reservations , some of which have suffered high rates of COVID-19 outbreaks . Other tribes on the list , however , have had few cases . Ethicists have described the practice as a case of racial profiling .
The decision to elevate the investigation comes as hospital workers told New Mexico In Depth and ███ that the hospital appeared to hide documents and discourage cooperation with state investigators .
Hospital employees said documents were removed from nursing stations , including COVID-19 screening and treatment protocols . In one internal communication viewed by the news organizations , a hospital official reminded workers that they did not need to talk to the investigators and provided a short script as a sample response .
“ They told us that DOH might be calling to ask us questions about the policy , and they told us we don ’ t have to talk to them , ” one clinician said . “ They suggested we could just not answer the phone . ”
Kunkel , the state ’ s highest-ranking public health official , said such an instruction would be a potential violation of the hospital ’ s operating agreement with CMS , as would removing documents with relevant information from inspectors ’ review . She promised the Health Department would assist federal investigators in any ongoing reviews .
It was not clear on Monday whether state inspectors obtained access to any documents employees said had been moved . The state ’ s report to CMS was not immediately released , and a state official did not immediately confirm that the hospital had given investigators all of the documents they sought . Once the hospital is notified of the findings , it will have 14 days to respond .
A photo of the ZIP code list , known informally as the “ Pueblos List. ” ( Obtained by ███ and New Mexico In Depth . Redactions added by ███ and New Mexico In Depth . )
A hospital spokeswoman said Friday that the hospital had not yet received notification of the results of the inspection . She declined to respond to repeated requests for comment regarding accusations that hospital administrators had attempted to impede the investigation .

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Federal regulators are ramping up scrutiny of a prominent women’s hospital here after clinicians’ allegations that Native Americans had been racially profiled for extra COVID-19 screening, leading to the temporary separation of some mothers from their newborns.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will refer findings from state investigators about a violation of patient rights at Lovelace Women’s Hospital to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, state officials said. The state Department of Health declined to specify details of the violations it had found.

The HHS Office for Civil Rights enforces federal laws banning discrimination in the provision of medical care and investigates violations of patient privacy rights.

“The allegations against Lovelace Women’s Hospital are very serious,” said New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Kathyleen Kunkel. The department “continues to be concerned that individuals will not access the medical care they need and are entitled to due to fear or mistrust.”

The state and federal actions were announced after an investigation by New Mexico In Depth and ProPublica found that Lovelace had a secret policy of designating Native American women as under investigation for coronavirus based on their appearance and a list of ZIP codes, regardless of their symptoms. The ZIP code list, known informally as the “Pueblos List,” a reference to New Mexico’s 19 Pueblo tribes, contained ZIP codes that corresponded with tribal reservations, some of which have suffered high rates of COVID-19 outbreaks. Other tribes on the list, however, have had few cases. Ethicists have described the practice as a case of racial profiling.

Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

The decision to elevate the investigation comes as hospital workers told New Mexico In Depth and ProPublica that the hospital appeared to hide documents and discourage cooperation with state investigators.

Hospital employees said documents were removed from nursing stations, including COVID-19 screening and treatment protocols. In one internal communication viewed by the news organizations, a hospital official reminded workers that they did not need to talk to the investigators and provided a short script as a sample response.

“They told us that DOH might be calling to ask us questions about the policy, and they told us we don’t have to talk to them,” one clinician said. “They suggested we could just not answer the phone.”

Kunkel, the state’s highest-ranking public health official, said such an instruction would be a potential violation of the hospital’s operating agreement with CMS, as would removing documents with relevant information from inspectors’ review. She promised the Health Department would assist federal investigators in any ongoing reviews.

It was not clear on Monday whether state inspectors obtained access to any documents employees said had been moved. The state’s report to CMS was not immediately released, and a state official did not immediately confirm that the hospital had given investigators all of the documents they sought. Once the hospital is notified of the findings, it will have 14 days to respond.

A hospital spokeswoman said Friday that the hospital had not yet received notification of the results of the inspection. She declined to respond to repeated requests for comment regarding accusations that hospital administrators had attempted to impede the investigation.

“We continue to modify screening and testing protocols based on” guidelines from the Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “as this pandemic continues and as the country continues to learn more about this disease,” hospital spokeswoman Whitney Marquez said in a statement.

The allegations of profiling have angered New Mexican political leaders and Native American activists. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham demanded an investigation into the hospital after the article by New Mexico In Depth and ProPublica.

ET Saturday on CNN and CNNgo
( CNN ) Fifty years ago this weekend , a 25-year-old John Lewis was beaten so badly by Alabama state troopers that they fractured his skull .
Lewis calls the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- where the troopers and and a group of white men deputized into a posse by the sheriff attacked hundreds of peaceful protesters on Bloody Sunday , March 7 , 1965 -- an `` almost holy place . ''
Now a Democratic U.S. congressman , Lewis is returning to Selma -- as he has nearly every year since that historic march -- to remember the fight for voting rights and to push voters across the country to participate in the political process . He also wants people to continue to speak up about the problems of racial injustice and poverty that persist in American society .
`` It is important to come back to remember Selma , '' Lewis told CNN in an interview at First Baptist Church . `` The vote is powerful . It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society and I do n't want people to forget that people paid a price .
`` Selma , these churches and these people , gave it everything they had . We would n't be where we are today as a nation and as a people ( if it ) had n't been for this community . ''
Churches -- like Selma 's First Baptist and Brown Chapel -- served as important meeting places during the movement , in part because they were run by the black community .
`` Without music , the movement would have been like a bird without wings , '' Lewis said .
He recalled how people would often sing during the marches , sometimes making up songs along the way .
`` Music helped create a sense of solidarity , and there were people in some communities , in some towns and cities like Selma , saying if the meetings are being held at the church , it must be all right . That 's the house of the Lord . They must be doing something that is right . ''
Activists had been working for years in and around Selma trying to help people register to vote . At the time , only 2.1 % of blacks in Dallas County were registered , Lewis said . When blacks attempted to register , they were often given impossible tasks , like counting the number of jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap , to complete before being allowed to sign up . Black lawyers , doctors , business people , public school teachers and college professors were told they could not read and write well enough to pass the so-called literacy test .
As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , Lewis -- along with many others -- would spill blood to change that , not only as a leader of the Bloody Sunday march but in other confrontations across the South .
Lewis was arrested some 40 times during the 1960s as he challenged the segregationist Jim Crow laws that kept blacks oppressed . He spent 44 days imprisoned in Mississippi during the Freedom Rides in 1961 . As a student at Fisk University , he organized sit-ins at lunch counters in Nashville , Tennessee , even spending his birthday in jail there in 1961 -- so Lewis was no stranger to run-ins with the law . But the events of Bloody Sunday would prove fateful for the movement .
Television cameras and photographers captured the troopers attacking the marchers with night sticks and whips -- one man in the posse even had a rubber hose wrapped with barbed wire , Lewis wrote in his memoir `` Walking with the Wind . ''
The troopers trampled the crowd with their horses and released nauseating tear gas . The pictures horrified citizens across the country . Eight days after the march , President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke before Congress about voting rights . He signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6 to ensure that all citizens would be able to vote regardless of their skin color .
Five decades later , Lewis said a great deal of progress has been made in the struggle for equality . But he added that , despite having twice elected a black man to the nation 's highest office , the country still has a long way to go to become the so-called `` Beloved Community '' Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned `` where we can lay down the burden of race . ''
`` We have a black president . We 've made a lot of progress , but we 're not a post-racial society yet , '' he said . `` We still have a distance to go . The scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American society . ''
Lewis , who has written a trilogy of graphic novels for young adults about his life called `` March , '' said it was important not to sweep the problems that still plague America under the rug and to instead speak up with a sense of `` righteous indignation . ''
`` You can not be quiet . You have to speak up . You have to speak out . You have to find a way to get in the way and make some noise , '' he said , referring in particular to the killings of unarmed black men by police last summer in Ferguson , Missouri , and New York City .
He urged those demonstrating against police brutality and racial injustice to study and model the nonviolent methods of the civil rights activists of the 1950s and '60s .
The poverty affecting people of all races across the country still gnaws at Lewis , as does a lack of access to a good education . He believes people should be outraged about hunger and violence , and fired up to renew and strengthen the Voting Rights Act after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling gutted the key provision requiring certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to `` pre-clear '' any changes to voting laws with the federal government before implementing them .
On Saturday , Lewis and nearly 100 members of Congress from both parties will join President Barack Obama at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader -- to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday . The bipartisan event comes as efforts to update to the Voting Rights Act have stalled in Congress . Still , Lewis is optimistic both parties can come together to fix it .

(CNN) Fifty years ago this weekend, a 25-year-old John Lewis was beaten so badly by Alabama state troopers that they fractured his skull.

Lewis calls the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- where the troopers and and a group of white men deputized into a posse by the sheriff attacked hundreds of peaceful protesters on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965 -- an ""almost holy place.""

Now a Democratic U.S. congressman, Lewis is returning to Selma -- as he has nearly every year since that historic march -- to remember the fight for voting rights and to push voters across the country to participate in the political process. He also wants people to continue to speak up about the problems of racial injustice and poverty that persist in American society.

""It is important to come back to remember Selma,"" Lewis told CNN in an interview at First Baptist Church. ""The vote is powerful. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society and I don't want people to forget that people paid a price.

""Selma, these churches and these people, gave it everything they had. We wouldn't be where we are today as a nation and as a people (if it) hadn't been for this community.""

Churches -- like Selma's First Baptist and Brown Chapel -- served as important meeting places during the movement, in part because they were run by the black community.

The solidarity of music

And music was vital as a unifying force.

""Without music, the movement would have been like a bird without wings,"" Lewis said.

He recalled how people would often sing during the marches, sometimes making up songs along the way.

""Music helped create a sense of solidarity, and there were people in some communities, in some towns and cities like Selma, saying if the meetings are being held at the church, it must be all right. That's the house of the Lord. They must be doing something that is right.""

Activists had been working for years in and around Selma trying to help people register to vote. At the time, only 2.1% of blacks in Dallas County were registered, Lewis said. When blacks attempted to register, they were often given impossible tasks, like counting the number of jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap, to complete before being allowed to sign up. Black lawyers, doctors, business people, public school teachers and college professors were told they could not read and write well enough to pass the so-called literacy test.

As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Lewis -- along with many others -- would spill blood to change that, not only as a leader of the Bloody Sunday march but in other confrontations across the South.

A fateful moment for the movement

Lewis was arrested some 40 times during the 1960s as he challenged the segregationist Jim Crow laws that kept blacks oppressed. He spent 44 days imprisoned in Mississippi during the Freedom Rides in 1961. As a student at Fisk University, he organized sit-ins at lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee, even spending his birthday in jail there in 1961 -- so Lewis was no stranger to run-ins with the law. But the events of Bloody Sunday would prove fateful for the movement.

""We have a black president. We've made a lot of progress, but we're not a post-racial society yet,"" he said. ""We still have a distance to go. The scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American society.""

The need for 'righteous indignation'

Lewis, who has written a trilogy of graphic novels for young adults about his life called ""March,"" said it was important not to sweep the problems that still plague America under the rug and to instead speak up with a sense of ""righteous indignation.""

""You cannot be quiet. You have to speak up. You have to speak out. You have to find a way to get in the way and make some noise,"" he said, referring in particular to the killings of unarmed black men by police last summer in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.

He urged those demonstrating against police brutality and racial injustice to study and model the nonviolent methods of the civil rights activists of the 1950s and '60s.

A bipartisan commemoration

On Saturday, Lewis and nearly 100 members of Congress from both parties will join President Barack Obama at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader -- to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.

CBS Reporter: Obama Would Be Envious,,,"New Gallup polling shows a double-digit increase ( 14 % ) in the state of race relations since President Donald Trump took office — a far cry from what the mainstream media airwaves echo to viewers every day .
“ Gallup ’ s survey demonstrates numerous categories in which the President has improved the lives of Americans since relieving Barack Obama of his duties in January of 2017 , ” The Political Insider reported Tuesday on the polling .
“ The polling indicates double-digit improvements in how Americans view the nation ’ s economy , security from terrorism , military strength and … the state of race relations , ” the report added .
According to Gallup , “ the position of blacks and other racial minorities , the distribution of income and wealth , and the opportunity for a person to get ahead through hard work ” have all increased under President Trump .
The Political Insider summed up : “ The position of blacks and other racial minorities in the nation rose 9 percent since Obama ’ s last day in office , while the state of race relations in America shot up 14 percent . ”
As noted by the outlet , CBS reporter Major Garrett commented last month that any president would be happy to oversee such numbers .
“ It can be fairly said that this administration , because of President Trump ’ s quiet prodding , has done quite a bit for funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities , the First Step Act , which was a massive first step toward criminal justice reform , ” Garrett stated .
“ That is a legacy on the agenda side that almost any president after three years would want to claim , particularly President Obama , ” the reporter noted .
Though the outlook was generally sunny for race relations under then-President Barack Obama , the reality was anything but . Mr. Obama ’ s penchant for interjecting racial narrative , even in local cases , was , no doubt , a catalyst for racial tension in the United States .
The BBC , which leans entirely Left , begrudgingly admitted this much in January 2017 .
“ Race relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009 . Though smaller in scale and scope , the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s , ” the BBC said .
“ The toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow , ” the outlet added . “ Not since the LA riots in 1992 – the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him – has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw . ”
The BBC noted that the Obama years “ gave rise ” to the controversial racially-charged movement Black Lives Matter and highlighted a significant drop in Americans regarding racial relations as good . “ Not long after he took office in 2009 , a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good , ” the BBC reported . “ In the midst of last summer ’ s racial turbulence , that poll found there had been a complete reversal . Now 69 % of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad . ”

The Lexow Committee undertook the first major investigation into police misconduct in New York City in 1894 . At the time , the most common complaint against the police was about “ clubbing ” — “ the routine bludgeoning of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks , ” as the historian Marilynn Johnson has written .
The Wickersham Commission , convened to study the criminal justice system and examine the problem of Prohibition enforcement , offered a scathing indictment in 1931 , including evidence of brutal interrogation strategies . It put the blame on a lack of professionalism among the police .
After the 1967 urban uprisings , the Kerner Commission found that “ police actions were ‘ final ’ incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders. ” Its report listed a now-familiar set of recommendations , like working to build “ community support for law enforcement ” and reviewing police operations “ in the ghetto , to ensure proper conduct by police officers . ”

The Lexow Committee undertook the first major investigation into police misconduct in New York City in 1894. At the time, the most common complaint against the police was about “clubbing” — “the routine bludgeoning of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks,” as the historian Marilynn Johnson has written.

The Wickersham Commission, convened to study the criminal justice system and examine the problem of Prohibition enforcement, offered a scathing indictment in 1931, including evidence of brutal interrogation strategies. It put the blame on a lack of professionalism among the police.

After the 1967 urban uprisings, the Kerner Commission found that “police actions were ‘final’ incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders.” Its report listed a now-familiar set of recommendations, like working to build “community support for law enforcement” and reviewing police operations “in the ghetto, to ensure proper conduct by police officers.”

''
Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities are a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement , but so too is the shocking lack of massive indignation . Given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world , we expected more passionate public outrage . What we got was a shrug of meh-rage .
When reading the dark squishy entrails of popular culture , meh-rage in the face of sustained prejudice is an indisputable sign of the coming Apatholypse : apathy to all forms of social justice . After all , if it ’ s OK to discriminate against one group of people by hauling out cultural stereotypes without much pushback , it must be OK to do the same to others . Illogic begets illogic .
Ice Cube ’ s June 10 daylong series of tweets , which involved some creepy symbols and images , in general implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks . NFL player DeSean Jackson tweeted out several anti-Semitic messages , including a quote he incorrectly thought was from Hitler ( not your go-to guy for why-can ’ t-we-all-get-along quotes ) stating that Jews had a plan to “ extort America ” and achieve “ world domination. ” Isn ’ t that SPECTRE ’ s job in James Bond movies ?
These statements would be laughed at by anyone with a middle-school grasp of reason , but then former NBA player Stephen Jackson , a self-proclaimed activist , undid whatever progress his previous advocacy may have achieved by agreeing with DeSean Jackson on social media . Then he went on to talk about the Rothschilds owning all the banks and his support for the notorious homophobe and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan . That is the kind of dehumanizing characterization of a people that causes the police abuses that killed his friend , George Floyd .
June continued to bust out all over with anti-Semitism when performer Chelsea Handler , herself Jewish , posted videos of Farrakhan to her 3.9 million followers . That means almost 4 million people received a subliminal message that even some Jews think being anti-Jewish is justified .
That same month , President Donald Trump ’ s reelection campaign also has been criticized for exploiting anti-Jewish biases , even though Trump ’ s son-in-law and campaign honcho Jared Kushner is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before they married . Playing on the same Rothschild ’ s trope , they issued a letter accusing three billionaires of Jewish descent of using their fortunes to “ rig the November election. ” This is the kind of “ very fine people on both sides ” Trump has employed throughout his political career — pandering to hate groups that has emboldened racists who feel like they ’ ve gotten the presidential OK to attack people they don ’ t like .
These famous , outspoken people share the same scapegoat logic as all oppressive groups from Nazis to the KKK : all our troubles are because of bad-apple groups that worship wrong , have the wrong complexion , come from the wrong country , are the wrong gender or love the wrong gender . It ’ s so disheartening to see people from groups that have been violently marginalized do the same thing to others without realizing that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism .
Yes , some of the above have apologized — DeSean Jackson , Stephen Jackson , Chelsea Handler — while others continue to defiantly marinate in their own prejudice . Their arrogant and irrational response to accusations of anti-Semitism , rather than dissuade us , actually confirmed people ’ s worst opinions . Ice Cube ’ s response was remorseless : “ What if I was just pro-Black ? This is the truth brother . I didn ’ t lie on anyone . I didn ’ t say I was anti anybody . DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE . I ’ ve been telling my truth. ” His “ truth ” was clearly anti-Semitic but , like Trump , he believes his truth exists outside facts . As writer Roxane Gay summed it up : “ It is impossible to take you seriously with regards to social justice or anything when you post anti-Semitic imagery . What the fuck are you doing ? ”
Even the apologies floundered , more attempts at spin than true contrition . In a CNN interview , Stephen Jackson was angry and belligerent at being called out : “ I stated I could have changed my words . There ’ s nothing that I said that I support any of that . There ’ s nothing I said that I hate anybody . I apologize for my words and I could have switched up . That ’ s the end of it . I love everybody. ” While it ’ s possible the words were wrong , celebrities have a responsibility to get the words right . It ’ s not enough to have good intentions , because it ’ s the actual deeds — and words — which have the real impact . In this case destructive impact . In 2013 , there were 751 reported hate crimes against Jews , but by 2019 the number had nearly tripled to 2,107 . That same year , a gunman in San Diego entered a synagogue and murdered one person while wounding three .
One of the most powerful songs in the struggle against racism is Billie Holiday ’ s melancholic “ Strange Fruit , ” which was first recorded in 1939 . The song met strong resistance from radio stations afraid of its graphic lyrics about lynching :
Despite those who wanted to suppress the song , it went on to sell a million copies that year and became Holiday ’ s best-selling record ever . The song was written by a white , Jewish high school teacher , Abel Meeropol , who performed it with his wife around New York before it was given to Holiday .
The lesson never changes , so why is it so hard for some people to learn : No one is free until everyone is free . As Martin Luther King Jr. explained : “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. ” So , let ’ s act like it .

Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
