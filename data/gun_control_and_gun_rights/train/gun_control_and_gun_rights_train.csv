Gun rights activists nationwide see the election as a pivotal moment in the gun debate
Colorado has rich history of guns and is site of two of the worst mass shootings in the U.S .
Sandy Phillips was a few days away from visiting her daughter , Jessie , an aspiring sports journalist , in Colorado . They exchanged text messages shortly after midnight on a Thursday , looking forward to the visit and talking about the new Batman movie Jessie was about to see .
They said goodnight , and Phillips tried going to sleep at her home in San Antonio .
Twenty minutes later she got a frantic phone call from Jessie 's close friend , Brent , who was with her at the theater . He said there was a shooting , that he was shot twice .
`` I said , 'Where 's Jessie ? ' '' Phillips recalls , before taking a short pause . `` He said , ' I tried ' . ''
Jessica Ghawi , 24 , was one of 12 people shot to death in July 2012 at a theater in Aurora , Colorado . Fifty-eight people were wounded . For Phillips , sharing her painful but final memory of Jessie is an emotional endeavor . Her voice thins and grows shaky as she talks about that night .
But it 's a challenge she has taken on dozens of times a day for the past week , going door to door in Colorado Springs as she asks voters to support a state lawmaker she never knew until this year : State Sen. John Morse .
As Senate president , Morse helped usher the passage of Colorado 's restrictive new firearm laws . The state 's deeply rooted gun rights establishment was not happy , and Morse is now one of two state senators on the ballot Tuesday in Colorado 's first recall at the state level .
Gun rights activists nationwide see the election as a pivotal moment in the gun debate . If Morse and his Democratic colleague , state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo , are both ousted , some say it will send a cautionary message to other lawmakers : Mess with guns and this could happen to you .
The other side also views the recall as a potential turning point . If the senators win , it could signal a significant show of public support at the polls for regulations meant to curb gun violence . Gun control advocates also argue a victory would deal a major blow to what they consider the powerful voices that control the debate .
National groups on both ends of the spectrum , including the National Rifle Association and Mayors Against Illegal Guns , have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the contests in what amounts to a proxy war over firearm regulations . At stake is a victory belt that can be used as leverage in future showdowns over the issue , either at the state level or in Washington .
Phillips and her husband , Lonnie , have been calling on 60 to 80 homes each day in Colorado for more than a week . While a number of conversations are short-lived , she shares her story with anyone willing to listen , hoping it will change minds .
`` It 's exhausting . You can only tell it so many times before you go to a very sad and dark place , '' she said . `` But you take a break and have a good cry , pull your boot straps back up and head out again . We ca n't just sit quietly by . ''
In March , Colorado became the second state after New York to put new gun laws on the books after the Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school shooting , which left 20 children and six adults dead .
Effective July 1 , Colorado 's new laws limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks on all gun purchases . Gun buyers , rather than sellers , must pay for their own background checks , a $ 10 fee .
The U.S. Senate tried passing similar laws earlier this year amid a highly charged national debate that rattled both sides of the issue . While most of the measures had little chance of survival , the Senate even fell short of the votes needed to proceed with what seemed to be the most viable piece of legislation : a bipartisan measure that would require background checks on firearms bought online and at gun shows .
Historically a conservative state , Colorado 's political makeup has started to shift . It is one of three states in the West with a Democratic trifecta : The party holds both chambers of the legislature and the governor 's office . While Colorado has trended blue in recent years , its blood runs red with a history rich in gun culture and tradition
`` Firearms are intertwined with the fabric of Colorado , '' said Jon Caldara , president of the Independence Institute , a Colorado conservative think tank . With the backing of 55 of the state 's 62 elected sheriffs , Caldera 's organization filed a lawsuit challenging the new laws .
As the home of two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history — Aurora and Columbine — Colorado has been a hot zone for the gun control debate . When state Senate committees held hearings one day over the gun measures in March , gun rights activists flooded the capitol in protest and drove around the building , honking horns for hours to cause a distraction . According to the Denver Post , a small plane flew overhead , carrying a floating message to the governor : Do n't take our guns
At the same time , lawmakers inside were also hearing from survivors and victims of gun violence , including former students at Columbine . Mark Kelly , husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , also testified about the shooting that seriously wounded his wife in the nearby state of Arizona .
By the end of the night , the two committees passed multiple gun control proposals . By the end of the month , Gov . John Hickenlooper signed the measures into law .
Morse , the Senate president who helped lead the way in the gun control push , now finds himself campaigning against a recall effort mounted against him a little more than a year before the end of his second term in office . Term-limited , he ca n't run for re-election .
But he said he does n't have any regrets in fighting for tighter gun laws . Asked why he advocated for new regulations in the face of fierce opposition , Morse pointed to the real catalyst of the renewed firearm debate .
`` The vision of 6- and 7-year-olds in Newtown being carted out on stretchers , with their Power Rangers T-shirts now covered by a white sheet , '' he said . `` We ca n't continue to bury our children . ''
It did n't take long for gun rights supporters to organize after the governor signed the gun package . With the help of the NRA , groups across the state attempted to gather signatures to recall a four state senators .
Activists , however , collected the required amount of signatures in only two districts , those represented by Morse and Giron . Morse 's district is largely a swing district , with nearly four in 10 active voters being unaffiliated with a political party . Thirty-four percent are registered Democrats and 26 % are registered Republicans . Giron 's district has a larger Democratic presence .
Since the recall tactic was first used in Los Angeles in 1903 , the effort has mostly been used at the municipal or local level , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Recalls are rarely successful for state lawmakers ; attempts have led to elections only 38 times in more than a century , with 17 of those officials actually being booted out of office .
In Colorado , opponents of the recall argue the tactic is a troubling sign for democracy . If recalls evolve into successful political maneuvers , Morse said , then both sides will start to use it and `` we 'll end up with general election in even-numbered years and recalls in odd-numbered years . ''
`` It will make governing even more difficult than it is , '' he said .
But supporters of the Colorado recall say the effort is a prime example of democracy at work .
`` Democracy does n't really live by a calendar , '' said Jennifer Kerns , a spokesperson for the group behind the recall effort against Morse . `` It 's up to the people when they want to rise up and do something like this . ''
Giron did n't know much about guns when she was elected to office ; she went to Denver to tackle other social and economic issues . When the debate exploded earlier this year , she decided to learn more about firearms . She held town halls , attended her first gun show and went to a shooting range with some friends .
She ultimately decided her district — and state — would be better off with laws that seek to keep guns out of `` the hands of felons , '' she said , referring to the universal background check measure .
`` This is not the wrong business to be fearful about doing the right thing , '' she added .
But a majority of Colorado voters disagree with Giron . According to a Quinnipiac University poll , 54 % of voters oppose the new gun laws , compared to 40 % who support them . At the same time , the poll indicates a majority do n't believe Giron and Morse should be recalled for their votes . By a margin of 60 % -31 % , Colorado voters say people should wait for re-election rather than attempt a recall when they disagree with their representative .
Kevin Healey , a 34-year-old voter in Pueblo , illustrates how the gun control debate in Colorado transcends traditional political divides . A staunch Second Amendment defender , Healey describes himself as an independent who `` leans very far to the left , '' except when it comes to gun rights issues .
Healey argued the effort to regulate guns to stop gun violence is a useless battle and lawmakers should be tackling mental health issues instead . `` It 's almost like fighting to the south when the problem is up north . It does n't make any sense . ''
Healey signed a recall petition a few months ago to put Giron on the ballot—a decision , he said , that did not come easily .
`` Pueblo is such a small town , it felt as if I was betraying someone behind her back , '' he said . Though he 's never really met her , he sent her an e-mail explaining why he had to sign the petition .
But after `` struggling for months , '' Healey has decided he 's not going to vote against Giron on Tuesday after all . While he disagrees with her on gun rights , he disagrees with her Republican opponent in the recall on just about everything . Essentially , he sees it as picking the lesser of two bad options .
Still , Healey does n't regret signing the original petition . No matter what the outcome , he thinks the recall sends a message to elected Democrats across the country that they ca n't `` just take the Second Amendment lightly . ''
`` It will make people think twice and be creative in legislating instead of doing something symbolic but completely useless , '' he said . `` I 'm sure her intention was genuine , but there has got to be more creative modes to stopping the violence . ''
Republican state Sen. Greg Brophy , who 's running for governor and has been part of the campaign to oust his Democratic colleagues , believes supporters of the recall have already won , because they got the warning out . `` The future of the Second Amendment will be decided in Colorado , '' he said .
He pointed to Giron 's district , where Democrats make up nearly half the active electorate , while unaffiliated voters make up 29 % and Republicans make up 23 % .
`` The fact that a Democratic state senator in a reliably Democratic seat , Pueblo , is either going to lose a recall or barely retain her office -- that 's a victory either way , '' he said . `` People in seats that are n't as reliably Democratic might want to be careful about advancing the gun control agenda . I see Tuesday as a win-win , or quite possibly , a win-no lose . ''
Not surprisingly , the two lawmakers whose names are on the ballot feel differently .
`` The numbers are going to prove that in a state that had two of the largest tragedies in this country , it would have been a travesty not to address this issue , '' Giron said .
Morse brushed off the notion that the recall has already done its work for gun rights activists .
`` They have n't won anything , '' he said . `` And hopefully wo n't win anything . ''","Story highlights Two Colorado state senators face recall elections over state's new tougher gun laws

Update at 11:15 a.m. ET: Senate Passes Measure:

The Associated Press reports that the committee cast a 10-8 party-line vote, with all Republicans opposed, on the measure to expand a requirement of background checks for gun sales between private parties.

The Associated Press reports:

""The bill's sponsor, New York Democrat Sen.

""[But] Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the panel, said he believes the measure will ultimately lead to a federal registry of gun owners — which is illegal.

Here's our original post:

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday is set to approve expanded federal background checks for gun buyers, moving the measure to the full Senate, where it could come up for a vote next month before going to the GOP-controlled House.

The bill would extend background checks — which are currently required only for sales by licensed dealers — to transactions between private individuals. It would also ""renew the requirement that states and federal agencies report records on felons, people with major mental health problems, drug abusers and others to the federal background check system — something that many states and agencies do poorly,"" The Associated Press reports.

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/01/15/control-politicians-not-guns/,"It's politicians we need to control, not guns",2013-01-15,Cal Thomas,"If laws were enough to deter criminal behavior prisons would be empty .
The latest effort to “ control ” guns in America is as likely to deter someone intent on breaking the law as outlawing lust would affect one ’ s libido . What ’ s in a heart can ’ t be controlled by restricting what ’ s in a hand .
Following the Newtown tragedy , President Obama vowed to seek the passage of an assault weapons ban and hastily assembled an administration-wide gun control task force , an effort that amounts to little more than a political act designed to impress what Rush Limbaugh calls “ low-information voters. ” Government must be seen doing something to keep mad men from shooting children and moviegoers , even if that something will likely prove ineffective .
“ Where there ’ s a will , there ’ s a way , ” the proverb goes , and someone who has the will to kill with a gun is going to find a way ( and a gun ) no matter how many laws are passed . Consider Chicago where numerous anti-gun laws appear to have done little to stop gun deaths .
President Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of the task force . Biden calls his gun control effort a “ moral issue. ” Does Biden suffer from selective morality ? For him , same-sex marriage and abortion don ’ t appear to be moral issues , as they are for his Catholic church , but gun control is .
The loss of liberty always begins at the extremes , but it won ’ t stop there . Radicals won ’ t be satisfied with outlawing one type of gun . In 1995 Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) , told “ 60 Minutes , ” “ If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States , for an outright ban , picking up ( every gun ) … Mr. and Mrs. America , turn ’ em all in . I would have done it… ” In 2004 , when he was an Illinois state senator , Barack Obama voted against a bill that affirms the right of citizens to defend themselves against home invasions . The bill ultimately passed .
The Sandy Hook shooter reportedly stopped killing children and killed himself when law enforcement officers arrived on the scene . This contains no lesson for the gun control crowd , which mostly opposes armed guards in schools . Neither does it matter to them that recently a Georgia woman , Melinda Herman , shot an intruder when police couldn ’ t get to her home quickly enough , thus defending her life and the lives of her two children . To gun control advocates , guns decide whether they are used for good or evil , not the people who fire them .
If President Obama attempts to impose new restrictions on guns by executive order , not Congress , what can individuals do ?

If laws were enough to deter criminal behavior prisons would be empty.

The latest effort to “control” guns in America is as likely to deter someone intent on breaking the law as outlawing lust would affect one’s libido. What’s in a heart can’t be controlled by restricting what’s in a hand.

Following the Newtown tragedy, President Obama vowed to seek the passage of an assault weapons ban and hastily assembled an administration-wide gun control task force, an effort that amounts to little more than a political act designed to impress what Rush Limbaugh calls “low-information voters.” Government must be seen doing something to keep mad men from shooting children and moviegoers, even if that something will likely prove ineffective.

“Where there’s a will, there’s a way,” the proverb goes, and someone who has the will to kill with a gun is going to find a way (and a gun) no matter how many laws are passed. Consider Chicago where numerous anti-gun laws appear to have done little to stop gun deaths.

President Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of the task force. Biden calls his gun control effort a “moral issue.” Does Biden suffer from selective morality? For him, same-sex marriage and abortion don’t appear to be moral issues, as they are for his Catholic church, but gun control is.

The loss of liberty always begins at the extremes, but it won’t stop there. Radicals won’t be satisfied with outlawing one type of gun. In 1995 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), told “60 Minutes,” “If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States, for an outright ban, picking up (every gun) … Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ’em all in. I would have done it…” In 2004, when he was an Illinois state senator, Barack Obama voted against a bill that affirms the right of citizens to defend themselves against home invasions. The bill ultimately passed.

The Sandy Hook shooter reportedly stopped killing children and killed himself when law enforcement officers arrived on the scene. This contains no lesson for the gun control crowd, which mostly opposes armed guards in schools. Neither does it matter to them that recently a Georgia woman, Melinda Herman, shot an intruder when police couldn’t get to her home quickly enough, thus defending her life and the lives of her two children. To gun control advocates, guns decide whether they are used for good or evil, not the people who fire them.

If President Obama attempts to impose new restrictions on guns by executive order, not Congress, what can individuals do? I asked constitutional attorney John Whitehead of The Rutherford Institute, “a nonprofit conservative legal organization dedicated to the defense of civil, especially religious, liberties and human rights.” “Even if the president has the authority to issue the executive order,” Whitehead replied by email, “the order may not violate the Constitution’s guarantees to individual liberty. If the order resulted in restrictions on gun ownership or possession that go beyond what is allowed under the Second Amendment, individuals who are harmed by the order could sue to have the order declared unconstitutional.”

We need to hear more stories of how law-abiding gun owners have managed to thwart criminals. As the predictable assault of anti-gun TV ads begins, the National Rifle Association should create its own ads with gun owners telling their stories of self-defense and crime prevention.

You know rational thinking is lacking when Pravda, Russia’s communist political newspaper, makes sense. In a recent article, Stanislav Mishin writes that after the Bolsheviks seized Moscow in 1917, they promised to leave alone the well-armed citizens if they did not interfere. “They did not and for that were asked afterwards,” writes Mishin, “to come register themselves and their weapons, whereupon they were promptly shot.”

The Second Amendment was written to protect citizens from tyrannical government and to preserve our liberties. It’s not primarily for the protection of hunters and target shooters, though they are included. Those politicians who wish to ignore the Constitution are the ones who need to be controlled, not law-abiding gun owners.

In a rare departure from tradition, Saturday's weekly presidential address was delivered not by President Obama but instead by Francine Wheeler, whose son Ben, 6, died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings last December.

Flanked by her husband, David, Wheeler called for Americans to urge the Senate to pass gun control legislation that it is scheduled to begin debating in the coming week.

""We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass commonsense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us,"" Wheeler said (see the White House video).

In the roughly four-and-a-half minute speech, Wheeler also recalled her son for his boundless energy, his musical talents, and a desire to be like his older brother, Nate. Her address, which the White House tells the AP was written by the Wheelers themselves, comes one day before the four-month anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., murders.

""Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home – the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6,"" Wheeler said, in an emotional passage that brought a brief pause. ""But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do – for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.""

The Wheelers were among a group of people who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook who flew to Washington earlier this week. They told their stories to several senators, in a move that is credited with giving new momentum to a bill that would expand background checks and boost school security spending, along with other moves.

U.S. District Judge Edmond E. Chang said in his ruling that while the government has a duty to protect its citizens , it 's also obligated to protect constitutional rights , including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense . However , Chang said he would temporarily stay the effects of his ruling , meaning the ordinances can stand while the city decides whether to appeal .
The decision is just the latest to attack what were some of the toughest gun-control laws in the nation . In 2010 , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Chicago 's long-standing gun ban . And last year , Illinois legislators were forced by a federal appeals court to adopt a law allowing residents to carry concealed weapons in Illinois , the only state that still banned the practice . The resulting state law largely stripped city and officials of surrounding Cook County of their authority to regulate guns , which especially irked officials in Chicago , where residents had to apply for concealed-carry permits through the police chief .
National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde applauded Chang 's decision , saying the fact a federal judge appointed by President Barack Obama `` ruled in favor of the Second Amendment , shows how out of step and outrageous Chicago 's ordinances really are . ''
Roderick Drew , a spokesman for Chicago 's law department , did not immediately return telephone calls for comment .
Chang 's ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the Illinois Association of Firearms Retailers and three Chicago residents . The judge noted Chicago 's ban covers not only federally licensed firearms dealers , but also gifts among family members , all in the name of reducing gun violence .
Chang wrote that the nation 's third-largest city `` goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms , and at the same time the evidence does not support that the complete ban sufficiently furthers the purposes that the ordinance tries to serve .

""It's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools,"" he said. ""The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection.""

He added: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""",www.foxnews.com,right,sHcZTliFcyorgcFf

The Senate's rejection of more robust gun purchase background checks was a stinging blow to President Obama that raised questions about his second-term agenda.

Expanding background checks had become a key part of Obama's post-Newtown push for tougher federal gun control laws. And in recent weeks, the president had campaigned for overall gun control legislation — especially the bipartisan background-check compromise — with a sense of urgency.

But neither the president's campaigning or plaintive personal appeals by family members of the Newtown victims, some of whom witnessed Wednesday's Senate vote in person, were able to push the Senate to cast the 60 votes needed to move the measure forward.

At a news conference, an obviously angry Obama blamed the loss on what he called NRA distortions of the legislation's purpose:

""The point is, those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate and as organized and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized, they're better financed, they've been at it longer and they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time.""

The amendment introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., fell short in a 54-46 vote. Five red-state Democrats up for re-election voted with most of the Republicans against the measure.

If Obama couldn't get an important win in a Democratic-controlled Senate on a measure that had overwhelming public support, according to polls, what's in store for other issues?

""He's using political capital, and when you use political capital this way and you lose, it hurts,"" said James Thurber, an American University political science professor and director of the school's Center for Presidential and Congressional Studies.

But, Thurber added: ""There will be new policies, new events that will come that will help him. He isn't a total lame duck, even though it's his second term. He still has a lot of power in certain areas, and certainly in the area of immigration he's going to have some leverage in terms of helping to bring a bill through the Senate and the House.""

In a surprisingly assertive speech at a memorial service for the 27 victims , including 20 children , Mr. Obama said that the country had failed to protect its young and that its leaders could no longer sit by idly because “ the politics are too hard. ” While he did not elaborate on what action he would propose , he said that “ these tragedies must end . ”
The speech , a blend of grief and resolve that he finished writing on the short Air Force One flight up here , seemed to promise a significant change in direction for a president who has not made gun issues a top priority in four years in office . After each of three other mass killings during his tenure , Mr. Obama has renewed calls for legislation without exerting much political capital , but the definitive language on Sunday may make it harder for him not to act this time .
“ No single law , no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society , ” he said . “ But that can ’ t be an excuse for inaction. ” He added that “ in the coming weeks I ’ ll use whatever power this office holds ” in an effort “ aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . ”
“ Because what choice do we have ? ” he added . “ We can ’ t accept events like this as routine . Are we really prepared to say that we ’ re powerless in the face of such carnage ? That the politics are too hard ? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom ? ”
Mr. Obama , speaking on a stark stage before a table of votive candles for each victim , mixed his call to action with words of consolation for this bereaved town . When he read the names of teachers killed defending their students , people in the audience gasped and wept .
The service came as new details emerged about the terrifying moments at the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday . Authorities said Sunday that the gunman , Adam Lanza , shot his mother multiple times in the head before his rampage at the school and that he still had hundreds of rounds of ammunition left when he killed himself . Gov . Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said Mr. Lanza shot himself as the police were closing in , suggesting that he may have intended to take more lives had he not been interrupted .
The president ’ s trip here came amid rising pressure to push for tighter regulation of guns in America . The president offered no specific proposals , and there were no urgent meetings at the White House over the weekend to draft legislation . Administration officials cautioned against expecting quick , dramatic action , especially given the end-of-the-year fiscal crisis consuming most of Mr. Obama ’ s time .
But the administration does have the makings of a plan on the shelf , with measures drafted by the Justice Department over the years but never advanced . Among other things , Democrats said they would push to renew an assault rifle ban that expired in 2004 and try to ban high-capacity magazines like those used by Mr. Lanza in Newtown . The president also said he would work with law enforcement and mental health professionals , as well as parents and educators .
The streets outside the memorial service and the airwaves across the nation were filled with voices calling for legislative action . By contrast , the National Rifle Association and its most prominent supporters in Congress were largely absent from the public debate .
“ These events are happening more frequently , ” Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , the independent from Connecticut , said here before the service began , “ and I worry that if we don ’ t take a thoughtful look at them , we ’ re going to lose the pain , the hurt and the anger that we have now . ”
Governor Malloy said on the CBS program “ Face the Nation ” that when someone can burst into a building with “ clips of up to 30 rounds on a weapon that can almost instantaneously fire those , you have to start to question whether assault weapons should be allowed to be distributed the way they are in the United States . ”
The grieving in this small New England town , aired nonstop on national television , adding emotional energy to the pressure on a newly re-elected Democratic president who has largely avoided the issue during four years in the White House . Mr. Obama has long supported the restoration of the assault weapon ban , which first passed in 1994 only to set off a backlash among supporters of gun rights that helped cost Democrats control of Congress . Given that political history , he has never made a robust , sustained lobbying effort for it .
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York , appearing on the NBC program “ Meet the Press , ” all but demanded that Mr. Obama confront the prevalence of firearms in the nation . Mr. Bloomberg , an independent who gave his support to the president shortly before the November election partly on the basis of gun control , bluntly said he expected more of Mr. Obama .
“ It ’ s time for the president to stand up and lead , ” he said . “ This should be his No . 1 agenda . He ’ s president of the United States . And if he does nothing during his second term something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns . ”
Mr. Bloomberg added that it was no longer enough that Mr. Obama shared his position on banning assault weapons . “ The president has to translate those views into action , ” he said . “ His job is not just to be well-meaning . His job is to perform and to protect the American public . ”
While the Sunday programs were filled with politicians , mainly Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein of California , demanding stronger gun control , supporters of gun rights were noticeably absent . David Gregory , the moderator of “ Meet the Press , ” said his program invited 31 senators who support gun rights to appear on Sunday . “ We had no takers , ” he said .
The National Rifle Association ’ s headquarters was closed Sunday and a spokesman could not be reached . A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican minority leader , said he had no comment , while Representative Eric Cantor , the Republican House majority leader , could not be reached .
Robert A . Levy , chairman of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and one of the organizers behind a Supreme Court case that in 2008 enshrined a Second Amendment right for individuals to own guns , said Sunday that with more than 250 million guns already in circulation in the United States , restrictions on new weapons would make little difference . He said by e-mail that tough gun laws did not stop a mass shooting in Norway or regular violence in places like the District of Columbia .
“ I ’ m skeptical about the efficacy of gun regulations imposed across the board — almost exclusively on persons who are not part of the problem , ” he said . “ To reduce the risk of multivictim violence , we would be better advised to focus on early detection and treatment of mental illness . An early detection regime might indeed be the basis for selective gun access restrictions that even the N.R.A . would support . ”
Attention focused mainly on Mr. Obama , who has shied away from a major push on gun control , even after events like the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson last year and the mass killing at a movie theater in Aurora , Colo. , this year . Some Democrats said the number of children involved in the Newtown massacre might change the dynamic but only if the president seizes the moment .
“ Nothing ’ s going to happen here unless Obama decides to put it front and center , ” said Steve Elmendorf , who was a top Democratic congressional aide in 1994 when lawmakers passed the now-expired assault weapon ban . “ He ’ s not running for re-election . This is one of those moments where you have to decide , ‘ I ’ m not going to sit here and examine the politics and I ’ m going to do what ’ s right . ’ ”
In the interfaith ceremony here , clergy members quoted from Psalm 23 , a Hebrew memorial chant and a Muslim prayer . The Rev . Matthew Crebbin , senior minister of the Newtown Congregational Church , said the message of the service was that “ these darkest days in the life of our community will not be the final words heard from us . ”
Some of the children in the audience of 1,700 clutched stuffed puppies handed out to them by the Red Cross . Some talked excitedly to one another about the coming holidays , their laughter a counterpoint to the sorrow of the service that followed .
In his 19-minute remarks , Mr. Obama said he had been reflecting on whether “ we ’ re doing enough to keep our children , all of them , safe from harm. ” He concluded : “ If we ’ re honest with ourselves , the answer is no . We ’ re not doing enough . ”
He concluded with biblical references and said the town reminds Americans of what should really matter . “ Let the little children come to me , Jesus said , and do not hinder them , ” Mr. Obama said . “ For such belongs to the kingdom of Heaven . ”
He then slowly read the names of the children who were killed on Friday as some in the audience sobbed , a haunting roll call of a class that will never convene again .

Avlon: Obama should increase federal enforcement of existing laws through executive order

Joe Biden doesn't much like the NRA -- and the feeling is mutual.

But on Thursday the NRA will be coming to the White House to meet with Biden and his fast-track gun reform task force, formed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and due to submit its recommendations by the end of the month.

There are obviously deep divisions between the two -- they are never going to agree on the vast majority of proposals, especially the assault weapons ban (despite the fact that it was once backed by Ronald Reagan) and a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips.

But there may be some surprising opportunities to find common ground, even on this most contentious issue. The NRA has backed specific plans to crack down on gun violence in the past that the president could enact through executive order, and polls of NRA members suggest there is even more unexpected common ground to be found.

Chumley,"Banning guns builds a “ culture of life ” and lawmakers must consider more clampdowns , not less , said one Catholic Church bishop in California in a written petition to U.S. senators .
“ Sadly , gun violence is too common a reality , ” said Bishop Stephen Blair , chairman on the bishops ’ Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development , in a letter to the U.S. Senate that was quoted by Catholic News Agency .
The “ violence that occurs daily in our homes and communities should lead us to answer the call of Pope Francis to ‘ change hatred into love , vengeance into forgiveness , war into peace . ’ ”
The bishop referenced in his letter S. 649 , the Safe Communities , Safe Schools Act of 2013 , and called it a “ positive step in the right direction ” that he hoped would give Congress a “ foundation to continue to address the issue of gun violence in society . ”
The restrictions and regulations contained in that bill would foster a culture of life , he said , in the letter , “ by promoting policies that reduce gun violence and save people ’ s lives in homes and communities throughout our nation . ”
The bishop took at aim at specific gun control measures and asked for Congress to act : The federal government should restrict “ civilian access to high-capacity ammunition magazines , ” he wrote , and should also outright ban all assault-type weapons , the Catholic news outlet reported .
Catholics View reported in January that while some members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have come out in favor of stronger gun controls , the Catholic Church has not adopted a political policy on the issue .
Pope John Paul II wrote in his Evangelium Vitae in 1995 that guns can be used in self-defense , in line with church teachings .
“ Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for someone responsible for another ’ s life , the common good of the family or of the state , ” he wrote , as reported by Catholics View .
The bishop ’ s call for tighter gun restrictions come as President Obama presses his case for stricter gun control .
The Senate is expected to take up gun control issues Thursday , after Sens . Pat Toomey , Pennsylvania Republican , and Joe Manchin , West Virginia Democrat , brokered a deal on background checks .","Banning guns builds a “culture of life” and lawmakers must consider more clampdowns, not less, said one Catholic Church bishop in California in a written petition to U.S. senators.

“Sadly, gun violence is too common a reality,” said Bishop Stephen Blair, chairman on the bishops’ Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, in a letter to the U.S. Senate that was quoted by Catholic News Agency.

The “violence that occurs daily in our homes and communities should lead us to answer the call of Pope Francis to ‘change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.’”

The bishop referenced in his letter S. 649, the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, and called it a “positive step in the right direction” that he hoped would give Congress a “foundation to continue to address the issue of gun violence in society.”

The restrictions and regulations contained in that bill would foster a culture of life, he said, in the letter, “by promoting policies that reduce gun violence and save people’s lives in homes and communities throughout our nation.”

The bishop took at aim at specific gun control measures and asked for Congress to act: The federal government should restrict “civilian access to high-capacity ammunition magazines,” he wrote, and should also outright ban all assault-type weapons, the Catholic news outlet reported.

Catholics View reported in January that while some members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have come out in favor of stronger gun controls, the Catholic Church has not adopted a political policy on the issue.

Pope John Paul II wrote in his Evangelium Vitae in 1995 that guns can be used in self-defense, in line with church teachings.

“Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for someone responsible for another’s life, the common good of the family or of the state,” he wrote, as reported by Catholics View.

The bishop’s call for tighter gun restrictions come as President Obama presses his case for stricter gun control.

The Senate is expected to take up gun control issues Thursday, after Sens. Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican, and Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, brokered a deal on background checks.

Andrew Cuomo worked out a tough proposal on gun control with legislative leaders who promised to pass the most restrictive gun law in the nation .
The measure passed the Senate 43-18 on the strength of support from Democrats , many of whom previously sponsored the bills that were once blocked by Republicans .
The Democrat-led Assembly gaveled out before midnight and planned to take the issue up at 10 a.m. Tuesday . It is expected to pass easily .
`` This is a scourge on society , '' Cuomo said Monday night , one month after the Newtown , Conn. , shooting that took the lives of 20 first graders and six educators . `` At what point do you say , ` No more innocent loss of life . '' '
`` It is well-balanced , it protects the Second Amendment , '' said Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos of Long Island . `` And there is no confiscation of weapons , which was at one time being considered .
`` This is going to go after those who are bringing illegal guns into the state , who are slaughtering people in New York City , '' Skelos said . `` This is going to put people in jail and keep people in jail who should n't be out on the street in the first place . ''
`` This will be the toughest gun control package in the nation , '' said Sen. Jeffrey Klein , leader of the Independent Democrat Conference that shares majority control with Republican senators . `` All in all , it is a comprehensive , balanced approach that will save lives , '' Klein said in an interview .
Cuomo said he wanted quick action to avoid a run on assault rifles and ammunition as he tries to address what he estimates is about 1 million assault rifles in New York state . He made it a centerpiece of his progressive agenda in last week 's State of the State address .
Republican Sen. Greg Ball called that political opportunism in a rare criticism of the popular and powerful governor seen by his supporters as a possible candidate for president in 2016 .
`` We have n't saved any lives tonight , except one : the political life of a governor who wants to be president , '' said Ball who represents part of the Hudson Valley . `` We have taken an entire category of firearms that are currently legal that are in the homes of law-abiding , tax paying citizens . ... We are now turning those law-abiding citizens into criminals . ''
The governor confirmed the proposal , previously worked out in closed session , called for a tougher assault weapons ban and restrictions on ammunition and the sale of guns , as well as a mandatory police registry of assault weapons , grandfathering in assault weapons already in private hands .
It would create a more powerful tool to require the reporting of mentally ill people who say they intend to use a gun illegally and would address the unsafe storage of guns , the governor confirmed .
Under current state law , assault weapons are defined by having two `` military rifle '' features spelled out in the law . The proposal would reduce that to one feature and include the popular pistol grip .
Private sales of assault weapons to someone other than an immediate family would be subject to a background check through a dealer . Also Internet sales of assault weapons would be banned , and failing to safely store a weapon could be subject to a misdemeanor charge .
Ammunition magazines would be restricted to seven bullets , from the current 10 , and current owners of higher-capacity magazines would have a year to sell them out of state . An owner caught at home with eight or more bullets in a magazine could face a misdemeanor charge .
In another provision , a therapist who believes a mental health patient made a credible threat to use a gun illegally would be required to report the incident to a mental health director who would have to report serious threats to the state Department of Criminal Justice Services . A patient 's gun could be taken from him or her .
The legislation also increases sentences for gun crimes including the shooting of a first responder that Cuomo called the `` Webster provision . '' Last month in the western New York town of Webster , two firefighters were killed after responding to a fire set by the shooter , who eventually killed himself .
Legislators would n't comment on the tentative deal or the provisions discussed in closed-door conferences .
`` It 's a tough vote , '' said Senate Deputy Majority Leader Thomas Libous of Broome County . `` This is a very difficult issue depending on where you live in the state . I have had thousands of emails and calls ... and I have to respect their wishes .

Trump leaves heads spinning

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

The man who suggested that if his opponent had been elected ""you'd be handing in your rifles"" endorsed taking guns away from people of questionable mental fitness and worrying about due process later.

The man who received $30m in support from the National Rifle Association during his presidential campaign scorned Washington politicians for being afraid of the NRA and said it had ""less power"" over him.

After a bipartisan meeting with congressional legislators, Donald Trump left heads spinning. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fierce gun-control advocate, clapped in joy, while some gun-rights Republicans wondered whose side the president was on.

Of course, we've seen this film before. In a January meeting with a similar group of congressional leaders, Mr Trump expressed support for any comprehensive bipartisan agreement on immigration. In the following days and weeks, his administration did everything it could to undermine the most popular compromise bill.

In fact , they are now so common that newspapers report them as if they are fender benders . Here 's a typical report from Thursday :
According to Baytown police , a 27-year-old man was riding in the passenger seat of a Honda Accord being driven by his 24-year-old brother-in-law . The men said an older-model green BMW almost struck them in the 3600 block of West Baker . The brother-in-law then drove to catch up with the BMW and words were exchanged . An occupant in the BMW began shooting into the Honda , striking the passenger in the face . The victim was taken to Houston Methodist San Jacinto Hospital in stable condition .
Similarly , YouTube commonly features videos of irate drivers pulling guns on freeways . ( Although , to be fair , it 's nearly impossible to verify if these are true incidents . )
New laws that allow the open carry of loaded guns in public places -- and such laws are springing up all over the nation -- have resulted in even more terrifying confrontations : For example , parents are forced to deal with gun activists brandishing their firearms in front of their kids in a public park , shouting : `` Look at my gun ! There 's nothing you can do about it ! '' Likewise , workers in businesses serving the public are forced to deal with customers blithely slinging loaded semi-automatic weapons over their shoulders , or casually leaning firearms up against tables . These owners have little recourse but to pray they do n't become the victim of one of the thousands of firearm-related accidents that occur all over the country every year .
But never let it be said that the gun rights zealots are totally rigid in their thinking and have no common sense at all . I have written in the past about the odd hypocrisy of gun proliferation advocates in Republican state houses who refuse to people the right to carry firearms in their work places , even as they pass laws making everyone else work in a world where an angry person with a gun might very well lose his or her temper and decide to make their point with a bullet .
The standard answer of such lawmakers is that politics -- unlike road rage or any other kind of everyday beef that humans are prone to provoke -- is a uniquely contentious job ; and therefore , having guns around is more dangerous for them than it is for the general public . What these pro-gun politicians wo n't admit is that the dangerous , contentious citizens who threaten them are their own voters , who are determined to keep these Republicans `` honest '' by showing up in the State House armed to the teeth .
But of all the denial , delusion and hypocrisy among gun proliferation activists around the nation , this latest report from Rachel Maddow takes the cake :
The National Rifle Association ’ s annual convention kicks off in Nashville this week , with 70,000 people expected to participate in the three-day gathering . Attendees can expect to find the usual NRA fare and exhibitors at the 350,000-square-foot Music City Center , but they shouldn ’ t expect to find functioning weapons . The Tennessean reports this week on the “ multilevel security plan , ” which includes an important safety measure : “ All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational , with the firing pins removed , and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer , near where the purchaser lives , and will require a legal identification . ”
The devil is in the details here . It is apparently common practice to remove the operational aspects of firearms on the floor of a gun show , one presumes in order to avoid the unpleasantness of someone accidentally killing a conventioneer . Maddow also reported that while the convention was going to ban operational firearms in the convention , it planned to allow them in the hall where the speeches would take place .

In fact, they are now so common that newspapers report them as if they are fender benders. Here's a typical report from Thursday:

According to Baytown police, a 27-year-old man was riding in the passenger seat of a Honda Accord being driven by his 24-year-old brother-in-law. The men said an older-model green BMW almost struck them in the 3600 block of West Baker. The brother-in-law then drove to catch up with the BMW and words were exchanged. An occupant in the BMW began shooting into the Honda, striking the passenger in the face. The victim was taken to Houston Methodist San Jacinto Hospital in stable condition.

Similarly, YouTube commonly features videos of irate drivers pulling guns on freeways. (Although, to be fair, it's nearly impossible to verify if these are true incidents.)

New laws that allow the open carry of loaded guns in public places -- and such laws are springing up all over the nation -- have resulted in even more terrifying confrontations: For example, parents are forced to deal with gun activists brandishing their firearms in front of their kids in a public park, shouting: ""Look at my gun! There's nothing you can do about it!"" Likewise, workers in businesses serving the public are forced to deal with customers blithely slinging loaded semi-automatic weapons over their shoulders, or casually leaning firearms up against tables. These owners have little recourse but to pray they don't become the victim of one of the thousands of firearm-related accidents that occur all over the country every year.

But never let it be said that the gun rights zealots are totally rigid in their thinking and have no common sense at all. I have written in the past about the odd hypocrisy of gun proliferation advocates in Republican state houses who refuse to people the right to carry firearms in their work places, even as they pass laws making everyone else work in a world where an angry person with a gun might very well lose his or her temper and decide to make their point with a bullet.

The standard answer of such lawmakers is that politics -- unlike road rage or any other kind of everyday beef that humans are prone to provoke -- is a uniquely contentious job; and therefore, having guns around is more dangerous for them than it is for the general public. What these pro-gun politicians won't admit is that the dangerous, contentious citizens who threaten them are their own voters, who are determined to keep these Republicans ""honest"" by showing up in the State House armed to the teeth.

But of all the denial, delusion and hypocrisy among gun proliferation activists around the nation, this latest report from Rachel Maddow takes the cake:

The National Rifle Association’s annual convention kicks off in Nashville this week, with 70,000 people expected to participate in the three-day gathering. Attendees can expect to find the usual NRA fare and exhibitors at the 350,000-square-foot Music City Center, but they shouldn’t expect to find functioning weapons. The Tennessean reports this week on the “multilevel security plan,” which includes an important safety measure: “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational, with the firing pins removed, and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer, near where the purchaser lives, and will require a legal identification.”

The devil is in the details here. It is apparently common practice to remove the operational aspects of firearms on the floor of a gun show, one presumes in order to avoid the unpleasantness of someone accidentally killing a conventioneer. Maddow also reported that while the convention was going to ban operational firearms in the convention, it planned to allow them in the hall where the speeches would take place.

The NRA has gone to some lengths to explain that they are simply following Tennessee state law which allows those with a permit to open carry and also allows venues to ban firearms if it chooses. But let's not kid ourselves: They would prefer it if they could let everyone carry fully loaded bazookas and M-16s, but they are restrained by the State's jackbooted thugs from doing so.

Still it's somewhat amusing that the National Rifle Association does not allow working firearms at their own convention, and that they would hold it in a state which requires gun permits and allows the banning of guns in public places. One would naturally assume from their propaganda that they would go someplace with looser gun laws under the assumption that their gathering would be the most polite convention in history, what with all the ""good guys with guns"" there to stop any ""bad guys with guns.""

And yes, they are actually going to allow armed people to attend the speeches by the vast roster of Republican presidential candidates who have been summoned to present their bona fides.

Full Coverage: Terrorism

The air station is surrounded by water on three sides and is home to Naval pilot training since 1941, according to its website. Marine Corps, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard student pilots train there. It’s also home to the Corpus Christi Army Depot, a depot for the Department of Defense rotary wing aircraft.

The station had a similar lockdown last December. In another incident at the base last year, a man pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property and possession of a stolen firearm for ramming his truck into a barricade at the Corpus Christi station.

Expanding Background Checks

But Reid promised the ban will be offered as an amendment. The weapons ban, affecting 157 gun models, would update the 1994 law that expired in 2004. (Reid voted against the original ban.)

High-Capacity Magazine Ban

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., plans to introduce a bill that would ban high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. It is similar to the provision in Feinstein’s bill.

“We owe it to them to vote on this measure,” Blumenthal said this week, referring to the Newtown families. “There is no turning back from a proposal to ban high-capacity magazines.”

Armed Prosecutors And Judges In Courtrooms, Federal Buildings

While Sandy Hook was Democrats’ catalyst for new gun control legislation, the shooting deaths of a Texas attorney and his wife similarly prompted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to introduce legislation to allow prosecutors and judges to carry weapons in courtrooms and other federal buildings for protection.

Cornyn told The Hill that “prosecutors put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve the peace of mind to go about their work without fearing for their safety.” His Line of Duty Act, S. 698, aims to do that and allows for the use of ammunition magazines “of any size.”

Improve Mental Health Care

Look for the presentation of bills or amendments that would improve mental health care in America, as well as keep guns out of the hands of those with mental health problems, something President Obama advocated for in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. A bipartisan group of senators including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, has proposed a measure that ensures the records of those with mental-health problems are placed into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as part of firearms-purchase screening.

The NRA has been demanding that gun control advocates focus on the mentally ill.

Anti-Gun Trafficking/Straw Purchasers

As part of their plan to improve public safety and get tougher on criminals, lawmakers will be considering the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Anti-Straw Purchasing and Firearms Trafficking Act. This would make it a felony for an individual to buy a gun on behalf of a felon or anyone barred from having one. The penalty for doing so is 15 to 25 years.

Yet , in some ways , the response to America ’ s most recent killing spree is exactly like all the others . Parents of victims beg conservative legislators to do their duty to protect children from military-grade weapons . Those legislators blame mental illness and the lack of metal detectors , armed guards , and personal firearms in schools . Marches and vigils are planned . Gun control legislation is proposed and swiftly shut down . Loved ones are left to grieve and try to make sense of the ghastly American lottery that decided it was their turn to sacrifice a child to the business of guns . The rest of the country moves on to the next massacre with a regularity that begets a shameful , inescapable numbness .
Gun-control advocates trying to interrupt this well-worn cycle have a difficult task ahead of them . Every shooting seems to spur activists to take a new angle on the seemingly intractable problem of a country saturated with killing machines . Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords started Americans for Responsible Solutions , a conservative-sounding gun-control PAC , after a man shot her in the head and killed six people at an event in her Arizona district . The June 2016 massacre at the Orlando Pulse nightclub inspired the creation of Gays Against Guns , or GAG , which colors its activism with sexual irreverence , and the Pride Fund , a PAC that describes itself as “ America ’ s only LGBTQ organization solely focused on gun policy reform. ” * After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , mothers founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America , informed by the successes of Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
In response to the Parkland shooting , advocates are trying a few tactics that are relatively new to the gun-control debate , if not to progressive activism writ large . Students in Connecticut are trying to plan a National School Walkout on April 20 , the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine massacre . Teachers have discussed doing their own . High school survivors from Parkland have announced a March for Our Lives to take place in Washington on March 24 , with concurrent satellite marches in other locales around the country , along the lines of the Women ’ s March held the day after Donald Trump ’ s inauguration . It has the potential to be the largest national demonstration for gun control the U.S. has ever seen .
Those who ’ ve watched children slaughtered in their classrooms many times over with no discernible change in gun-control policy or decline in American gun ownership may have reason to doubt that any of these activist measures will accomplish what the others have not . None of the organizations founded after other massacres have shifted the U.S. gun-control conversation in meaningful ways , jolted the general public into a new sense of urgency , or changed the hearts and minds—and , more importantly , the votes—of legislators . Recent polling shows that 97 percent of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchasers , including 97 percent of gun owners , and more than two-thirds support a nationwide ban on assault rifles . Clearly , public opinion is not enough to sway public officials bankrolled by the National Rifle Association , which opposes any expansion of federal gun regulations , including stronger background checks .
Any gun-control legislation passed by the current federal government will require Republicans to swallow decades ’ worth of pride and essentially admit that they ’ ve been lying about guns all along . There are almost no facts on the GOP ’ s side when it comes to guns : All available data conflicts with the right-wing narrative that guns are effective tools of civilian self-defense . Republicans know this , and argue for more guns , including guns in schools , anyway . Gun-control advocates will have to give Republican legislators willing to buck the party line—if any exist—feasible cover from organizations like the NRA .
Even if Congress succeeds in passing new legislation , the courts have also historically favored pro-gun arguments . In 2008 , the Supreme Court ruled D.C. ’ s handgun ban unconstitutional . Lower courts later struck down the District ’ s ban on open and concealed carry and , just last fall , its requirement that firearm owners present a “ good reason ” for getting a concealed carry permit . The kinds of sweeping restrictions that would actually make a significant dent in gun deaths might fizzle at the Supreme Court even if they somehow made it out of the legislature .
In other words , the best outcomes gun-control activists can hope for in the foreseeable future are incremental . Florida legislators have agreed to consider instating a three-day waiting period for all rifle purchases and raising the legal age for assault-rifle possession to 21 . Such a law might have prevented Nikolas Cruz , the 19-year-old who allegedly murdered his Parkland classmates with an AR-15 , from buying his gun , but only temporarily . The same legislative body refused to even discuss a possible ban on assault weapons , while teen survivors of Parkland looked on , even as they approved a resolution calling pornography a public health risk . These are not people prepared to be moved by a rousing address , postcards from progressives , or a march on the National Mall .
Like the Women ’ s March , the March for Our Lives hopes to make a statement with a massive turnout backed by a loose policy goal— “ to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues. ” The organizers of the Women ’ s March have made the bewildering decision to hold their own event , a school walkout , 10 days before the March for Our Lives , possibly diluting the impact of both . ( They would have been wise to confer with the teens leading the post-Parkland charge about how the Women ’ s March organization could best support their common goals . ) In some ways , the Women ’ s March is an example of what marches can and can not accomplish : The organization ’ s own anti-gun march from NRA headquarters in Virginia to the Department of Justice , held last summer , had no apparent effect on policy or public discourse . The people marching , and the people paying attention , were all on the same side , and those who weren ’ t were unlikely to be swayed by protest signs . But the main Women ’ s March last January emboldened large numbers of brand-new activists to channel political power in their home communities toward progressive ends . The changes they ’ ve made have been small but significant—supporting local candidacies , organizing town halls with legislators , confronting racism within feminist movements . The march ’ s full impact will not be felt for years or decades to come .
Likewise , the brilliant Parkland activists may fall short of their immediate goals , but they are shaping a political future that will outlive the NRA ’ s best-funded apologists . A recent model of presidential voting found that events that occur when a person is 14 to 24 years of age have the biggest effect on her political views . What a person experiences at age 18 has three times the impact on her worldview as what she experiences at age 40 . Today ’ s teenagers , born after the Columbine shooting in 1999 , which set off an unending cycle of school shootings in America , have lived their whole lives under the specter of a school massacre . Now , they are witnessing their peers take on elected officials and the country ’ s most powerful interest group on national television , and watching as the adults in charge sputter falsehoods in response to life-or-death truths . Teens , who also walked out of their schools after Trump ’ s election and Jeff Sessions ’ decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , are now protesting injustice as a matter of course .
The Parkland activists are inspiring , and inspired by , a new generation of leaders who feel confident in their power , and who know how to use social media for effective organizing . That ’ s partly a credit to Black Lives Matter actions , which prompted students to rise up in Ferguson , Missouri ; Baltimore ; and around the country , and the Women ’ s March itself , which encouraged young feminists to see themselves as part of a broader , intersectional movement . A teenager ’ s lack of experience in social-justice organizing is also her strength : She sees possibilities and promise where adults are too tired or cynical to go . An issue as divisive and urgent as guns , which seems to set people on one of two mutually exclusive planes of reality , demands that fresh perspective .
But what is idealism , gumption , and fire against a multibillion-dollar status quo ? Parkland leader Emma González and some of her peers will be eligible to vote this fall , and most others will come of age by the 2020 elections . Perhaps by the time they ’ re ready to run for office , the Republican Party will be ready to relax its stranglehold on gun policy , especially if González ’ s voter registration push brings waves of new Democrats to the polls come November . As Trump ’ s election confirmed , people tend to vote with their affiliated party , and Republican voters are extraordinarily unlikely to want gun control enough to vote against their party ’ s candidate . Young voters , who trend progressive , have the lowest voter turnout of any age group . If they made guns their one big issue and actually showed up at their polling places to prove it , they might have a shot at kicking out enough of the GOP to make meaningful strides against gun violence and scare the party into rethinking its obstinance . In that sense , the gun lobby ’ s lies are just the first of two major opponents Parkland activists will face in their fight . The second is apathy . If the thousands of students marching in the streets this week are a representative cross-section of their generation , that may not be such an impossible obstacle to overcome .

The shape of the Parkland, Florida, shooting’s aftermath is unlike that of any other American massacre. For the first time, the teenage survivors of a school shooting have assumed the mantle of leading the activist response to the tragedy. Their courage in the face of fear and loss has inspired several nationwide actions this week, including student-led walkouts at middle schools and high schools in Virginia, Maryland, Arizona, and Kentucky, among other states.

Yet, in some ways, the response to America’s most recent killing spree is exactly like all the others. Parents of victims beg conservative legislators to do their duty to protect children from military-grade weapons. Those legislators blame mental illness and the lack of metal detectors, armed guards, and personal firearms in schools. Marches and vigils are planned. Gun control legislation is proposed and swiftly shut down. Loved ones are left to grieve and try to make sense of the ghastly American lottery that decided it was their turn to sacrifice a child to the business of guns. The rest of the country moves on to the next massacre with a regularity that begets a shameful, inescapable numbness.

Michael Cargill , a popular handgun instructor in Austin , had this to say : `` You pull that gun out , your life is gon na change . '' He 's right .
Of the millions of Americans who get a concealed handgun permit , only a tiny fraction ever use them . Pro-gun folks compare it to a fire extinguisher in the home — you have it just in case .
But what happens when someone actually fires their weapon in self-defense ? I met three concealed handgun permit ( CPL ) holders in Detroit who pulled the trigger .
`` I was parked at the pump right in front of the gas station . I exited my vehicle and before I could even get to the door of the gas station , the young man was already sitting in the driver 's seat of my vehicle , '' says Standberry , who just earned a degree in green energy technology . He 'd left his Yukon XL running with the key in the ignition .
He says he told the young man to get out of his car . The young man told him to step back . That 's when Standberry says he saw the carjacker reach toward his pocket .
Standberry unholstered his Sig Sauer .45 , reached through the passenger-side window , and fired one shot . He hit the carjacker in the torso . Gravely wounded , the carjacker drove away , crashed into a tree and died . Police found a pistol in his pocket .
`` It changed a lot in my life , '' he says . `` Matter of fact , in my English class , I just did a report on it . I named it , 'The incident that changed my life forever . ' ``
Standberry went to counseling . He became fearful of gas stations . And he carried the burden of killing a 19-year-old .
`` You know why ? Because my son was 19 at the same time . It really bothered me that I had to take a 19-year-old 's life . His life was just beginning . But he was into the wrong things . To this day , I still ask God for forgiveness , '' he says .
Gonville is a mother of three , a big woman who works as a bouncer at a Detroit bar .
Gonville was coming home from work late at night . She 'd stopped at a store for a bottle of papaya juice . A scrawny guy walked up , pulled out a pistol and demanded her money . His accomplices were watching from a car behind him . As it happened , Alaina was carrying her pistol openly on her hip .
`` I 'm assuming they saw my gun . That 's when they opened fire from their vehicle . I heard the gunshots coming at me . That 's when I pulled my gun and returned fire , '' she says .
She does n't know if she hit them or not . The robber bolted . His henchmen sped out of the parking lot , spraying Gonville and her car with military-grade bullets .
`` I got shot with an AK-47 , and it basically blew my arm off . It was dangling . I carried it into the hospital . After four surgeries and a lot of prayer it 's healed about 70 percent , '' she says .
Did she think that having a handgun that night saved her life or endangered her more ?
`` That 's a good question . I replayed the situation in my head over and over . I ca n't say , but I 'm glad I had it , '' she says .
Born in Colombia , Rodriguez owns a small tree-trimming business in a Detroit suburb . Last October , she was outside a Home Depot loading some materials into her truck .
`` A lady comes screaming through the door for help , and somebody [ was ] running , '' she says .
A man was running into the parking lot pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise . Rodriguez used to work at Home Depot , and she knows the company policy : Do n't pursue shoplifters . But she says she thought this was more serious because a lady was screaming .
She saw the shoplifters getting away in an SUV . She had her Heckler and Koch 9 mm .
`` So I take my gun out and I point at the car when he was coming towards us . I jump to the side and decide to shoot out the tires to stop them , '' she says .
In Michigan , it 's illegal for a citizen to use deadly force to stop a property crime . Rodriguez got 18 months of probation for reckless discharge of a weapon and had her gun license revoked . She thinks the punishment would have been harsher , but the cops caught the shoplifters after she shot out their tires .
Her story got lots of news coverage . It turned into a case study of when not to use your pistol .
`` It was not my intention to do anything wrong . I was just trying to help somebody who really needed it . And it backfired on me . So what do you learn ? It 's like you have to think a lot before you help somebody , '' she says .
For this story , I contacted firearms instructors and lawyers who reached out to dozens of handgun carriers who had pulled the trigger in self-defense . To my surprise , very few wanted to talk .
Some had been arrested by the police or sued afterward , and had spent thousands of dollars on legal fees . They did n't want to be dragged into the media spotlight again . Others were just traumatized by the whole experience .
Gonville urges people to think long and hard before they carry a gun .
`` A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it 's cool to have a gun , '' she says . `` It 's not just about being cool . It 's real life . Life and death is serious . Getting shot is serious . Shooting somebody is serious . ''
An eye-opening Gallup poll released late last year revealed that 56 percent of respondents said they 'd feel safer if more Americans could get permits to carry concealed handguns . Jennifer Carlson , a sociologist at the University of Toronto , wrote a book about handgun carriers in Michigan called Citizen-Protectors .
A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it 's cool to have a gun . It 's not just about being cool . It 's real life . Life and death is serious .
`` This is what I think is really fascinating , '' she says . `` It 's not just the idea of if I conceal carry then I 'm safer . It 's the idea that if I just imagine there 's people out there who are conceal carrying then the world is safer . ''
All the trigger pullers I talked to for this story said the range time required to get a handgun license is grossly inadequate in terms of being prepared to defend themselves from an active shooter . They believe they 're alive today because they did extensive practice on their own .
Mark Cortis , a veteran firearms instructor in Detroit , urges all of his CPL students to get more training . But he says hardly any of them ever do .

`` One of my concerns about the [ Michigan ] state requirements for getting a CPL is they do n't really include the tactics and the strategy that one will need to win or prevail in an actual gun situation , '' Cortis says . `` A hostile attack by a violent criminal is a fight . ''
Not only are most handgun carriers in America totally unprepared for a gunfight , but gun-control activists hasten to point out that more guns lead to more suicides and accidental shootings .
Three years ago , Detroit 's new police chief , James Craig , made a startling public announcement . He encouraged law-abiding citizens to consider carrying concealed weapons as a deterrent to violent crime .
In an interview , I asked Chief Craig if he ever worries about the citizens that he has urged to arm themselves ?
`` What concerns me , more than anything else , is guns in the hands of criminals , guns in the hands of terror suspects . That 's what keeps me up at night . Not armed citizens , '' Craig says .
Meanwhile , Cortis reports so many Detroiters are seeking concealed pistol permits , classes are booked for two months out .","Does Carrying A Pistol Make You Safer?

How Does Carrying A Gun Change You?

Let's point out people in their cars. We make a game of it, of who can find somebody in their car just sitting there.""

The gun girls talk about their firearms differently than men do. Guys speak of them as tools; these women talk about them like pets.

""We name our guns,"" Sandoval says, ""I have Francesca, Dolly, Gracie. And we talk about 'em like, 'I'm takin' Gracie to the mall with us.'

""My small one is my Baby,"" says schoolteacher Bettylane Chambliss. ""And my dad will say, 'Do you have your gun with you?' And I went, 'Oh, yeah, I got Baby with me. I'm fine.' ""

When Can You Pull The Trigger?

Despite the pet names, there's nothing casual about getting a license to carry a pistol.

A gun in the home? The owner may have it primarily for hunting or target-shooting. A concealed gun out in public? It goes with the explicit understanding that the owner may kill someone they feel threatened by.

Michael Cargill, a popular handgun instructor in Austin, had this to say: ""You pull that gun out, your life is gonna change."" He's right.

Of the millions of Americans who get a concealed handgun permit, only a tiny fraction ever use them. Pro-gun folks compare it to a fire extinguisher in the home — you have it just in case.

But what happens when someone actually fires their weapon in self-defense? I met three concealed handgun permit (CPL) holders in Detroit who pulled the trigger.

Life-Changing And Traumatic: Darrell Standberry

""I was parked at the pump right in front of the gas station. I exited my vehicle and before I could even get to the door of the gas station, the young man was already sitting in the driver's seat of my vehicle,"" says Standberry, who just earned a degree in green energy technology. He'd left his Yukon XL running with the key in the ignition.

He says he told the young man to get out of his car. The young man told him to step back. That's when Standberry says he saw the carjacker reach toward his pocket.

Standberry unholstered his Sig Sauer .45, reached through the passenger-side window, and fired one shot. He hit the carjacker in the torso. Gravely wounded, the carjacker drove away, crashed into a tree and died. Police found a pistol in his pocket.

""It changed a lot in my life,"" he says. ""Matter of fact, in my English class, I just did a report on it. I named it, 'The incident that changed my life forever.' ""

Standberry went to counseling. He became fearful of gas stations. And he carried the burden of killing a 19-year-old.

""You know why? Because my son was 19 at the same time. It really bothered me that I had to take a 19-year-old's life. His life was just beginning. But he was into the wrong things. To this day, I still ask God for forgiveness,"" he says.

Caught In A Gunfight: Alaina Gonville

Gonville is a mother of three, a big woman who works as a bouncer at a Detroit bar.

Gonville was coming home from work late at night. She'd stopped at a store for a bottle of papaya juice. A scrawny guy walked up, pulled out a pistol and demanded her money. His accomplices were watching from a car behind him. As it happened, Alaina was carrying her pistol openly on her hip.

""I'm assuming they saw my gun. That's when they opened fire from their vehicle. I heard the gunshots coming at me. That's when I pulled my gun and returned fire,"" she says.

She doesn't know if she hit them or not. The robber bolted. His henchmen sped out of the parking lot, spraying Gonville and her car with military-grade bullets.

""I got shot with an AK-47, and it basically blew my arm off. It was dangling. I carried it into the hospital. After four surgeries and a lot of prayer it's healed about 70 percent,"" she says.

Did she think that having a handgun that night saved her life or endangered her more?

""That's a good question. I replayed the situation in my head over and over. I can't say, but I'm glad I had it,"" she says.

In Trouble For Thwarting Shoplifters: Tatiana Rodriguez

Born in Colombia, Rodriguez owns a small tree-trimming business in a Detroit suburb. Last October, she was outside a Home Depot loading some materials into her truck.

""A lady comes screaming through the door for help, and somebody [was] running,"" she says.

A man was running into the parking lot pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise. Rodriguez used to work at Home Depot, and she knows the company policy: Don't pursue shoplifters. But she says she thought this was more serious because a lady was screaming.

She saw the shoplifters getting away in an SUV. She had her Heckler and Koch 9 mm.

""So I take my gun out and I point at the car when he was coming towards us. I jump to the side and decide to shoot out the tires to stop them,"" she says.

In Michigan, it's illegal for a citizen to use deadly force to stop a property crime. Rodriguez got 18 months of probation for reckless discharge of a weapon and had her gun license revoked. She thinks the punishment would have been harsher, but the cops caught the shoplifters after she shot out their tires.

Her story got lots of news coverage. It turned into a case study of when not to use your pistol.

""It was not my intention to do anything wrong. I was just trying to help somebody who really needed it. And it backfired on me. So what do you learn? It's like you have to think a lot before you help somebody,"" she says.

For this story, I contacted firearms instructors and lawyers who reached out to dozens of handgun carriers who had pulled the trigger in self-defense. To my surprise, very few wanted to talk.

Some had been arrested by the police or sued afterward, and had spent thousands of dollars on legal fees. They didn't want to be dragged into the media spotlight again. Others were just traumatized by the whole experience.

Gonville urges people to think long and hard before they carry a gun.

""A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun,"" she says. ""It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious. Getting shot is serious. Shooting somebody is serious.""

Is It Safer To Carry A Gun?

An eye-opening Gallup poll released late last year revealed that 56 percent of respondents said they'd feel safer if more Americans could get permits to carry concealed handguns. Jennifer Carlson, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, wrote a book about handgun carriers in Michigan called Citizen-Protectors.

A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun. It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious.

""This is what I think is really fascinating,"" she says. ""It's not just the idea of if I conceal carry then I'm safer. It's the idea that if I just imagine there's people out there who are conceal carrying then the world is safer.""

All the trigger pullers I talked to for this story said the range time required to get a handgun license is grossly inadequate in terms of being prepared to defend themselves from an active shooter. They believe they're alive today because they did extensive practice on their own.

Mark Cortis, a veteran firearms instructor in Detroit, urges all of his CPL students to get more training. But he says hardly any of them ever do.

Planet Money Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Listen · 3:38 3:38

""One of my concerns about the [Michigan] state requirements for getting a CPL is they don't really include the tactics and the strategy that one will need to win or prevail in an actual gun situation,"" Cortis says. ""A hostile attack by a violent criminal is a fight.""

Not only are most handgun carriers in America totally unprepared for a gunfight, but gun-control activists hasten to point out that more guns lead to more suicides and accidental shootings.

Three years ago, Detroit's new police chief, James Craig, made a startling public announcement. He encouraged law-abiding citizens to consider carrying concealed weapons as a deterrent to violent crime.

In an interview, I asked Chief Craig if he ever worries about the citizens that he has urged to arm themselves?

""What concerns me, more than anything else, is guns in the hands of criminals, guns in the hands of terror suspects. That's what keeps me up at night. Not armed citizens,"" Craig says.

Meanwhile, Cortis reports so many Detroiters are seeking concealed pistol permits, classes are booked for two months out.",www.npr.org,center,ZzHRLe0bNrSlKKLL

And buried inside President Barack Obama 's signature health care legislation is a little-known provision that prevents the government and health insurers from asking about gun ownership .
The NRA says it is simply ensuring that taxpayer money is n't being used to promote a political agenda .
`` If gun control groups ... ( and ) individuals want to further their research , we 're not saying they should n't be able to do it , '' NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN . `` We 're just saying they should n't be using public funds to do it . ''
But public health experts say it 's all part of an attempt by the NRA-led pro-gun lobby to hamstring lawmakers .
`` If a bunch of people do research and generate solid evidence that suggests firearms policy should be reformed and either firearms or people who used them should be regulated in new ways , ( if I 'm a gun-rights advocate , ) I 'm not going to like that , '' said Dr. Garen Wintemute , head of the violence prevention research program at the University of California at Davis .
`` So , I 'll simply prevent the evidence from being collected in the first place . It 's a brilliant strategy , and ( the gun lobby ) succeeded . ''
It was n't a lot of money -- $ 2.6 million -- but it represented the bulk of the nation 's research on firearms safety in the mid-1990s .
`` With regards to gun research , it was enormous , '' said Stephen Teret , the founding director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research .
In the 1990s , this small portion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's budget went to a program headed by Dr. Mark Rosenberg that funded two high-profile studies that concluded the risks of having a loaded gun in the home outweigh the benefits .
`` That was demonstrated if you counted dead bodies ; it was demonstrated if you counted individuals shot but not killed ; and tallied up the good guys versus the bad guys , '' said Dr. Arthur Kellermann , who led the research teams under Rosenberg 's National Center for Injury Prevention program .

But the studies created what Teret described as `` the lightning rod that started the bolts of lightning from the pro-gun side . ''
Flexing its political muscle on Capitol Hill , the NRA successfully pushed for legislation that effectively ended Rosenberg 's program .
To underscore its point , Congress -- in a move led by Jay Dickey , a former gun-rights advocate and Republican legislator from Arkansas -- added this language to the agency 's appropriation : `` None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control . ''
At the time , critics in Congress accused the researchers of pursuing an anti-gun agenda and said the CDC 's work was redundant .
The language created what Teret called `` a chilling effect '' for nearly all gun-related work at the CDC . Though the agency continues to track gun deaths and injuries , it does little work on how to prevent them .
Many years later , the National Institutes of Health funded a similar study that triggered the same lightning-bolt response .
In 2009 , the NIH study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed .
Two years later , Congress added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the CDC to all agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services , including the NIH .
Today , the NRA maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary .
`` What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms , '' the NRA 's Arulanandam said , `` not to carry out more studies . ''
Rosenberg , who left the CDC in 1999 , explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open .
For example , he said , it 's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence ; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths ; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths .
`` These are very big questions that we need to know the answer to , '' said Rosenberg , who is now president and CEO of The Task Force for Global Health .
There are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues .
But none was as far-reaching as what Rosenberg 's program did in the 1990s .
Now that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on Capitol Hill after last month 's mass shooting at a Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school , the focus has turned to the medical community 's role in the debate .
Last week , The Washington Post reported on a little-known provision added to the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home .
While the provision does n't forbid doctors from asking about guns , it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information , documenting it and using it for research .

Unanswered questions

So why are government studies on gun violence necessary?

Rosenberg, who left the CDC in 1999, explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open.

For example, he said, it's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths.

""These are very big questions that we need to know the answer to,"" said Rosenberg, who is now president and CEO of The Task Force for Global Health.

There are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues.

But none was as far-reaching as what Rosenberg's program did in the 1990s.

Now that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on Capitol Hill after last month's mass shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school , the focus has turned to the medical community's role in the debate.

Last week, The Washington Post reported on a little-known provision added to the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home.

While the provision doesn't forbid doctors from asking about guns, it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information, documenting it and using it for research.

A similar law in Florida went a step further and would actually penalize doctors if they ask their patients about whether they own a gun, in most cases. A federal judge overturned the law, but Gov. Rick Scott has vowed to appeal.

Gun-rights advocates, including the NRA, have raised concerns about tracking this data, including the possibility that acknowledging legal gun ownership could bring higher insurance premiums.

With these restrictions and the revived gun debate, doctors should become active participants in the discussion about gun violence and gun policy in this country, according to the American College of Physicians

Where things stand now

When Adam Lanza unleashed a hail of bullets inside an elementary school on December 14, ending the lives of 20 young children and six staff members, the debate over America's gun laws reopened.

Days later, Obama announced that a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden would create ""real reforms right now.""

As Giffords visited nine states in the past two weeks , the National Rifle Association was working in at least 30 , with advertising and get-out-the-vote manpower , to strengthen its position in Washington and state capitals . She will be widely outspent this year by the NRA and others who support the rights of gun owners .
Two days after Giffords ’ appearance in Seattle , a 15-year-old high school student shot and killed two people and killed himself in an attack north of the city that seriously wounded three others . The shooting has barely made a ripple in the final days of the campaign .
“ Long , hard haul , ” Giffords told The Associated Press in a brief interview after her Seattle event , using one of the short phrases that now dominate her speech .
In part by design , but also in recognition of the country ’ s political landscape , not a single candidate in this year ’ s midterm elections for statewide or federal office appeared with Giffords as she made her way from Maine to Washington state over 10 days .
She drew visits from Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , both Democrats , neither running for re-election next month .
“ If this happened in March or December or any other time , we ’ d have asked other politicians to join , ” said Marti Anderson , an Iowa state lawmaker who helped organize a Giffords event in Des Moines . “ But it ’ s risky 15 days before an election . ”
Instead , Giffords took part in a series of discussions about domestic violence in smaller venues such as a Des Moines public library and a high school classroom in Portland , Oregon . With the Senate majority at stake , Giffords isn ’ t running television ads in states where Democratic incumbents are seeking re-election , among them North Carolina , Arkansas , Louisiana and New Hampshire .
The exception is Iowa , where her group announced plans this week to run television ads against Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst . “ Joni Ernst won ’ t vote to close the loophole that lets some dangerous people still get guns , ” Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald says in the ad set to run through Election Day .
Said Pia Carusone , Giffords ’ longtime chief aide , “ We went in knowing we had to be strategic and careful . ”
The NRA has no such concerns . The powerful gun-rights lobby has spent more than $ 27.3 million this year on elections in at least 27 states through Oct. 15 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Giffords ’ organization , by contrast , has spent just $ 6.6 million in seven states .
The financial advantage is just one piece of the NRA ’ s strength .
“ Anyone who tries to gauge the National Rifle Association by money alone is making a huge mistake , ” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam , citing 5 million dues-paying members and many more voters who look to his organization for guidance on how to vote on Election Day .
Arulanandam said he ’ s grateful that Giffords is “ on the mend and getting better every day , ” but he criticized her political goals . “ People realize that regardless of what she says , her endgame is similar to Michael Bloomberg and President Obama , which is draconian gun control , ” he said .
Giffords and her husband , former astronaut Mark Kelly , have gone to great lengths to rebut such criticism . Recently , with little sign that an effort to adopt universal background checks will pass in Congress , Giffords has focused on promoting a measure that would prevent convicted stalkers and abusive “ dating partners ” from accessing guns .
In a letter opposing the measure , the NRA says it “ manipulates emotionally compelling issues such as ‘ domestic violence ’ and ‘ stalking ’ simply to cast as wide a net as possible for federal firearm prohibitions . ”
Giffords ’ team was initially hopeful , but it now concedes that the bill is not likely to come up in Congress ’ lame-duck session . And while the mood was largely positive during Giffords ’ tour , the frustration they ’ re not connecting with voters this election season was evident .
“ It ’ s hard not to be , as a person in this country , disappointed by the lack of response , ” Carusone said . “ But we ’ re not surprised . We knew this wouldn ’ t be easy . ”","SEATTLE (AP) — She has delivered the same 64-word speech eight times already, but Gabby Giffords is struggling to get through the ninth.

“If this happened in March or December or any other time, we’d have asked other politicians to join,” said Marti Anderson, an Iowa state lawmaker who helped organize a Giffords event in Des Moines. “But it’s risky 15 days before an election.”

Instead, Giffords took part in a series of discussions about domestic violence in smaller venues such as a Des Moines public library and a high school classroom in Portland, Oregon. With the Senate majority at stake, Giffords isn’t running television ads in states where Democratic incumbents are seeking re-election, among them North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Hampshire.

The exception is Iowa, where her group announced plans this week to run television ads against Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst. “Joni Ernst won’t vote to close the loophole that lets some dangerous people still get guns,” Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald says in the ad set to run through Election Day.

Said Pia Carusone, Giffords’ longtime chief aide, “We went in knowing we had to be strategic and careful.”

The NRA has no such concerns. The powerful gun-rights lobby has spent more than $27.3 million this year on elections in at least 27 states through Oct. 15, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Giffords’ organization, by contrast, has spent just $6.6 million in seven states.

The financial advantage is just one piece of the NRA’s strength.

“Anyone who tries to gauge the National Rifle Association by money alone is making a huge mistake,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam, citing 5 million dues-paying members and many more voters who look to his organization for guidance on how to vote on Election Day.

Arulanandam said he’s grateful that Giffords is “on the mend and getting better every day,” but he criticized her political goals. “People realize that regardless of what she says, her endgame is similar to Michael Bloomberg and President Obama, which is draconian gun control,” he said.

Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, have gone to great lengths to rebut such criticism. Recently, with little sign that an effort to adopt universal background checks will pass in Congress, Giffords has focused on promoting a measure that would prevent convicted stalkers and abusive “dating partners” from accessing guns.

In a letter opposing the measure, the NRA says it “manipulates emotionally compelling issues such as ‘domestic violence’ and ‘stalking’ simply to cast as wide a net as possible for federal firearm prohibitions.”

Giffords’ team was initially hopeful, but it now concedes that the bill is not likely to come up in Congress’ lame-duck session. And while the mood was largely positive during Giffords’ tour, the frustration they’re not connecting with voters this election season was evident.

“It’s hard not to be, as a person in this country, disappointed by the lack of response,” Carusone said. “But we’re not surprised. We knew this wouldn’t be easy.”

The White House and most Democrats are behind a proposal that requires background checks for all gun sales , although even that is far less than what gun control advocates had hoped . Obama , though , won ’ t get anything better in the House , and he might not get that much .
After the Newtown tragedy , Obama pledged to use the full power of his office to prevent another such rampage . He ’ ll be in Hartford on Monday with victims of the shooting to continue his drive for congressional action on guns .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) is set to huddle Monday with other Democratic leaders to hash out a floor strategy . Reid will have to decide early in the week whether a bipartisan compromise on background checks is possible or whether a promised GOP filibuster will prevent the Senate from taking broad action .

Democratic leaders are considering advancing one of three background checks bills : a Democrat-only bill by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer — the “ gold standard , ” as one gun control advocate put it — goes forward to almost certain defeat ; an alternative proposal by Sen. Tom Coburn ( R-Okla. ) without Democratic backing that calls for universal checks but includes wide exemptions for record-keeping added after pressure from gun rights groups ; and a bill by Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) , which calls for expanding background checks and records requirements for commercial sales but not private ones .
Reid and top Democrats will decide which version to put forward , and the outlook there is far from certain .
Up until now , Democrats have been unable to line up a conservative Republican to back a broad background checks bill . Manchin last week began negotiating with Toomey — a longtime ally of the powerful National Rifle Association — but as of now , no deal has been reached .
Manchin has until Tuesday to reach a compromise with Toomey for his expanded but not universal background checks bill . Since those talks began in earnest last Thursday , gun control and law enforcement groups have expressed their dismay over the possibility of ceding the universal checks that they — along with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden — have called for since Newtown .
Obama , Biden and Schumer have all been in regular contact with Coburn , but their talks haven ’ t yielded a breakthrough .","The prospects look bleak for those hoping for sweeping reform. A make-or-break week on guns

President Barack Obama finds out this week whether he scratches out a narrow victory on gun control — or ends up with nothing at all.

Four months after the mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school reignited the national debate over gun control, the issue is finally headed to the Senate floor. And the prospects still look bleak for those hoping for sweeping reform.

Story Continued Below

The unlikely key to the answer might be a conservative GOP senator from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey. The former head of the Club for Growth has emerged as a last-minute possible partner on a deal. But his stamp of approval is far from certain. If a deal emerges, Republicans could delay action on it for a week.

( Also on POLITICO: Hill holds Obama's legacy in its hands)

Senate action is Obama’s best chance for a deal — but even there, Democrats haven’t settled on which bill to advance. The White House and most Democrats are behind a proposal that requires background checks for all gun sales, although even that is far less than what gun control advocates had hoped. Obama, though, won’t get anything better in the House, and he might not get that much.

After the Newtown tragedy, Obama pledged to use the full power of his office to prevent another such rampage. He’ll be in Hartford on Monday with victims of the shooting to continue his drive for congressional action on guns.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is set to huddle Monday with other Democratic leaders to hash out a floor strategy. Reid will have to decide early in the week whether a bipartisan compromise on background checks is possible or whether a promised GOP filibuster will prevent the Senate from taking broad action.

Proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are all but guaranteed to go down to lopsided defeats. The battle is now over how tough to make a background checks bill for gun sales — which polls show the public broadly supports. Conservatives have balked at record-keeping requirements when background checks are conducted, and Democrats have had a difficult time finding a GOP ally to sign on to a deal including them.

Democratic leaders are considering advancing one of three background checks bills: a Democrat-only bill by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer — the “gold standard,” as one gun control advocate put it — goes forward to almost certain defeat; an alternative proposal by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) without Democratic backing that calls for universal checks but includes wide exemptions for record-keeping added after pressure from gun rights groups; and a bill by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), which calls for expanding background checks and records requirements for commercial sales but not private ones.

Reid and top Democrats will decide which version to put forward, and the outlook there is far from certain.

Up until now, Democrats have been unable to line up a conservative Republican to back a broad background checks bill. Manchin last week began negotiating with Toomey — a longtime ally of the powerful National Rifle Association — but as of now, no deal has been reached.

Manchin has until Tuesday to reach a compromise with Toomey for his expanded but not universal background checks bill. Since those talks began in earnest last Thursday, gun control and law enforcement groups have expressed their dismay over the possibility of ceding the universal checks that they — along with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden — have called for since Newtown.

Obama, Biden and Schumer have all been in regular contact with Coburn, but their talks haven’t yielded a breakthrough.",www.politico.com,left,13vPhocJ7zs8wQvJ

The president , who has been eager to take action following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school this month , hosted a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House to explore potential ways to curb gun violence .
But instead of focusing on areas of bipartisan consensus , Trump spent a majority of the hourlong meeting voicing support for a hodgepodge of ideas that are anathema to the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) and likely to give conservatives heartburn .
The president appeared eager to position himself as a Republican who is willing to stand up to the powerful gun group and pushed GOP lawmakers to do the same .
“ Some of you are petrified of the NRA , ” Trump said . “ They do have great power over you people . They have less power over me . I don ’ t need it , what do I need ? ”
Still , Trump did express support for ending gun-free school zones , which is a priority backed by the NRA . The president also said he likes the idea of arming trained teachers and faculty members with weapons , though suggested it may be a decision better left up to the states .
Trump seemed to be in his element during the televised , freewheeling meeting , which allowed him to play the role of dealmaker-in-chief .
He promised to write an executive order banning bump stock , devices that make semi-automatic weapons fire more rapidly , telling lawmakers they can “ focus on other things ” when writing legislation .
He repeatedly urged members to put all their ideas into one single comprehensive bill as opposed to passing several piecemeal measures , suggesting one of the background check bills in the Senate could serve as the building block for overarching legislation .
“ It would be so beautiful if we could have one bill everybody could support , ” Trump said .
In one stunning moment , Trump seemed to advocate for confiscating guns from individuals deemed dangerous .

The president, who has been eager to take action following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school this month, hosted a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House to explore potential ways to curb gun violence.

But instead of focusing on areas of bipartisan consensus, Trump spent a majority of the hourlong meeting voicing support for a hodgepodge of ideas that are anathema to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and likely to give conservatives heartburn.

The president appeared eager to position himself as a Republican who is willing to stand up to the powerful gun group and pushed GOP lawmakers to do the same.

“Some of you are petrified of the NRA,” Trump said. “They do have great power over you people. They have less power over me. I don’t need it, what do I need?”

Still, Trump did express support for ending gun-free school zones, which is a priority backed by the NRA. The president also said he likes the idea of arming trained teachers and faculty members with weapons, though suggested it may be a decision better left up to the states.

Trump seemed to be in his element during the televised, freewheeling meeting, which allowed him to play the role of dealmaker-in-chief.

He promised to write an executive order banning bump stock, devices that make semi-automatic weapons fire more rapidly, telling lawmakers they can “focus on other things” when writing legislation.

He repeatedly urged members to put all their ideas into one single comprehensive bill as opposed to passing several piecemeal measures, suggesting one of the background check bills in the Senate could serve as the building block for overarching legislation.

“It would be so beautiful if we could have one bill everybody could support,” Trump said.

In one stunning moment, Trump seemed to advocate for confiscating guns from individuals deemed dangerous.

“I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida ... to go to court would have taken a long time,” Trump said. “Take the guns first, go through due process second.”

Some Republicans are already firing back at that suggestion.

The officers were searching for Mr. Filippidis ‘ Florida-licensed , palm-size Kel-Tec .38 semi-automatic handgun , which he left at home locked in his safe . ( Maryland does not recognize handgun permits issued by other states . )
When the search turned up nothing , Mr. Filippidis , 51 , was allowed to go and was issued only a speeding warning .
The incident gained national attention . Mr. Filippidis went on multiple radio programs and described in detail how scared and outraged he and his family were . He wondered : How did the police know he was licensed for concealed carry , and what right did they have to search through his personal items on the side of the busy interstate filled with holiday travelers on that 10-degree day ?
“ My wife ’ s hysterical , shaking and crying , ” Mr. Filippidis recalled in an interview with The ███ . “ I don ’ t have a criminal record . I own a business . I ’ m a family man , and I tried to explain that to [ the officer ] . But he had a bad attitude , didn ’ t want to hear my story . He just wanted to find that gun and take me away from my family . That was his goal , but he couldn ’ t do it , because I didn ’ t have a gun , like I told him . ”
Mr. Filippidis ‘ case earned the support of Second Amendment advocates and subsequent apologies from the MDTA . But an internal police review concluded his stop and search were lawful and did not violate police protocols .
Those findings , however , have not satisfied other out-of-state gun owners , who worry that they , too , have been targeted for minor traffic stops in Maryland because they have concealed weapons permits . Their stories are accumulating .
John Tonnesen IV of Lake Worth , Florida , was pulled over and arrested after a search of his work truck — by the same officer who stopped Mr. Filippidis — turned up his .45-caliber Ruger , licensed in the state of Florida . He doesn ’ t believe the stop was coincidental .
“ It was unloaded and stuffed into a bag far from me , ” Mr. Tonnesen told The Times . “ There ’ s scanners in Maryland that scan every tag , and Florida is one of their target vehicles . They ’ ll find whatever reason they can to pull you over . ”
MDTA denies it targets out-of-state gun owners and noted the review of Mr. Fillipides earlier traffic stop concluded the officers did nothing wrong .
“ The MDTA Police conducted a review of the traffic stop and have concluded that the stop and subsequent search of the vehicle were justified , ” spokesman Jonathan Green wrote in an emailed statement . “ The investigation did not reveal any violations of law or agency policy . ”
The officer who stopped both gun owners is “ assigned to the I-95 corridor where there is a large volume of out of state travelers , ” Mr. Green said .
Baltimore-based criminal defense lawyer Paul Kramer says these type of stops and searches happen far too often in Maryland and are a waste of taxpayer money . Mr. Kramer represented a Pennsylvania security officer who was pulled over in the state for speeding . The Maryland officer asked Mr. Kramer ’ s client whether he had a gun in the car , and once the man acknowledged he did , the officer arrested him for having the gun and the cartridge in the same locked container — not separated , as per Maryland law .
“ You think that Maryland would honor legitimate people with guns rather than charging people who are legitimately carrying but doing it incorrectly , ” said Mr. Kramer , who was former deputy U.S. attorney for Maryland . “ I would think that the police would want to take the time to go after those people who don ’ t have a legitimate right to have a gun rather than locking up people who have a valid license .
“ An otherwise law-abiding citizen can get arrested here . It ’ s just a waste of officer time and resources . The police should let those people go , ” he said .
Maryland is one of the toughest gun control states in the nation and passed the Maryland Firearm Safety Act of 2013 , which , among its provisions , bans 45 assault weapons and limits gun magazines to 10 rounds . Maryland also has strict laws governing the transportation of guns and issues concealed carry only on a “ need-based ” determination . Maryland does not recognize any out-of-state carry licenses .
Gun rights advocates are trying to pressure Gov.-elect Larry Hogan , a Republican , to get involved in a legal effort by a coalition of gun owners and gun rights groups to invalidate the law . Twenty-one states have filed briefs with the court supporting the challenge . In a news conference in November after winning the election , however , Mr. Hogan said he would leave it to the courts to decide .
That ’ s not stopping advocates like Mr. Tonnesen , 50 , from pleading to Mr. Hogan to investigate whether Maryland is targeting out-of-state concealed-carry holders .
On his way up north to visit family for the holidays this year , Mr. Tonnesen left his weapon behind but came armed with a letter addressed to Mr. Hogan instead , detailing his arrest last year and questioning why Maryland is using its limited resources to target out-of-staters .
“ I got six months probation before adjudication on my record , and I didn ’ t do anything wrong , ” Mr. Tonnesen said . “ My father gave me my first rifle when I was eight . I have respect for guns and know how to use them . A terrible injustice happened to me , and it ’ s a phenomenal waste of the state ’ s resources that the governor should be aware [ of ] . ”
Mr. Hogan ’ s office confirmed receipt of the letter but declined further comment on it .
As governor , Mr. Hogan will “ uphold both the U.S. Constitution and the laws of Maryland ; he will not overturn existing Maryland law and will work across party lines to reduce gun violence , ” Hogan spokeswoman Erin Montgomery told The Times .
Academics say Mr. Hogan is likely to stay far away from gun control issues as he begins his tenure as a rare Republican elected official in a mostly blue state .
“ Of course , some conservatives would love to see Maryland ’ s gun control law changed , but Hogan recognizes the political reality that Maryland is a liberal state — and if he wants to accomplish anything economically , he ’ s going to have to stay away from the social issues , ” said David Lublin , a professor of political science at American University who runs a blog , Seventh State , dedicated to Maryland politics . “ Gun control is popular in the state , and , although I don ’ t see him strengthening it , a sort of vagueness suits him well on the issue . ”
Mr. Hogan ran in the blue state on his strengths as a businessman — someone who understood working-class families and the consequences of increased taxes .
With Democrats holding nine of the state ’ s 10 seats in Congress , having large majorities in both state houses , and with the attorney general and state comptroller both being Democrats , if Mr. Hogan wants to generate good will to pass through some of his economic changes , he will have to stay away from gun control , which the majority of the state favors , Mr. Lublin said .
According to a 2013 poll conducted by Gonzales Research & Marketing Strategies Inc. , which surveyed more than 800 of the state ’ s registered voters , 58 percent said they support the gun control law enacted under Gov . Martin O ’ Malley .
As for the MDTA , officials maintain only people who are committing traffic violations are pulled over , not those who have out-of-state concealed carry licenses .
“ It is important to note that no gun-permitting information is programmed into any License Plate Reader units accessible to MDTA Police , ” Mr. Green said .
In Mr. Filippidis ‘ case , he was pulled over because he was going 72 mph in a 55 mph zone and was tailgating the officer , Mr. Green said .
“ The officer observed the concealed carry gun permit while the driver was searching for his driver ’ s license and vehicle registration in his wallet , ” Mr. Green said .
“ After personally observing the gun permit , the officer asked the driver to step from the vehicle and inquired about the location of the weapon , ” Mr. Green said . “ The driver denied that there was a weapon in the vehicle .
“ The officer returned to the vehicle to ask the occupant of the front passenger seat about the location of the gun . The occupant of the front passenger seat indicated that the gun was possibly in the glove box or the console of the vehicle and reached for the glove box before being advised by the officer to stop . ”
“ The officer who stopped Mr. Filippidis smelled the odor of marijuana in the vehicle on his initial approach of the vehicle , ” Mr. Green said . “ Based on the conflicting stories regarding the location of the gun , the observations made while the vehicle was being stopped and the suspected odor of marijuana , the officer had probable cause to search the vehicle for possible controlled dangerous substances ( CDS ) and the weapon . ”
Mr. Filippidis vehemently denies there was any smell of marijuana in his car , and he didn ’ t know that was the excuse used to justify the search of his SUV . He did say he may have been going a little over the speed limit , and his wife was confused about the whereabouts of his gun .
“ If they smelled pot , why didn ’ t they arrest me for pot ? ” Mr. Filippidis said . “ This whole thing just doesn ’ t add up . Smoking in front of my kids driving home from Christmas with the family ? Come on . We walked away from the entire incident without even a ticket — for anything . ”
As for Mr. Tonnesen , a search of his vehicle was justified after the same officer felt threatened and that Mr. Tonnesen was hiding something as both of his hands weren ’ t readily visible . He was also pulled over for speeding .
“ They have kids shooting each other in the face up there in Maryland , ” Mr. Tonnesen said . “ And yet here I am cooperating with the officer , because I know his job is hard , and I respect that .

Twenty-one states have filed briefs with the court supporting the challenge.

Obama talks gun control in Chicago
CHICAGO — For four years , President Barack Obama avoided talking about guns .
Then the Newtown shooting forced gun control legislation to the top of his agenda — but he still avoided talking about gun violence that has racked his hometown of Chicago .
But the killing of Hadiya Pendleton drew him back here in a way he could no longer avoid .
Friday afternoon , Obama will return to the area he used to represent in the state Senate , and the neighborhood where the 15-year-old was gunned down by gun violence just a week after performing at his Inauguration . Even though his speech will focus on some of the policies aimed at helping the middle class and poor that he laid out in his State of the Union address Tuesday , according to a White House official said , he ’ ll use the chance to acknowledge violence here and across the country .
Complicating things further as he approaches the topic : The explosion of gun violence has come under the mayoralty of Rahm Emanuel , Obama ’ s former chief of staff . And that ’ s despite tough gun laws in the city — a contrast that ’ s fed arguments from gun control opponents that none of the laws the president ’ s pushing on a national level would do much to solve the problem .
Gun violence is a familiar topic to Obama — he launched his career as a community organizer and spent seven years as a local elected official representing some of the toughest neighborhoods of Chicago . And though he hasn ’ t spent much time back here since moving to the White House , the city is still home for the president . But conscious of upsetting pro-gun groups and of appearing to undermine Emanuel , he ’ s made only a few passing mentions over the past year about Chicago street violence — which included 506 murders last year .
Unlike former presidents , Obama can ’ t deny that he has a deep understanding of the cycle of poverty , drugs and guns that plagues neighborhoods of cities like Chicago , said the Rev . Jesse Jackson , who had been calling for Obama to return home since soon after Pendleton was killed on Jan. 29 .
“ He knows the problems ; he ’ s seen them ; and this perfect storm of events means he ’ s coming home to talk about them , ” Jackson said . “ Because he knows , he can help illuminate the urban crisis and call out for real action . ”
Emanuel discussed the visit in similar terms earlier in the week .
“ Given that the lion ’ s share of both the perpetrators and the victims are young African-American men , ” Emanuel asked , “ who better to have that discussion than the president of the United States , who has repeatedly talked about fathering and the role of fathering ? ”

Obama talks gun control in Chicago

CHICAGO — For four years, President Barack Obama avoided talking about guns.

Then the Newtown shooting forced gun control legislation to the top of his agenda — but he still avoided talking about gun violence that has racked his hometown of Chicago.

Story Continued Below

But the killing of Hadiya Pendleton drew him back here in a way he could no longer avoid.

Friday afternoon, Obama will return to the area he used to represent in the state Senate, and the neighborhood where the 15-year-old was gunned down by gun violence just a week after performing at his Inauguration. Even though his speech will focus on some of the policies aimed at helping the middle class and poor that he laid out in his State of the Union address Tuesday, according to a White House official said, he’ll use the chance to acknowledge violence here and across the country.

Complicating things further as he approaches the topic: The explosion of gun violence has come under the mayoralty of Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s former chief of staff. And that’s despite tough gun laws in the city — a contrast that’s fed arguments from gun control opponents that none of the laws the president’s pushing on a national level would do much to solve the problem.

Gun violence is a familiar topic to Obama — he launched his career as a community organizer and spent seven years as a local elected official representing some of the toughest neighborhoods of Chicago. And though he hasn’t spent much time back here since moving to the White House, the city is still home for the president. But conscious of upsetting pro-gun groups and of appearing to undermine Emanuel, he’s made only a few passing mentions over the past year about Chicago street violence — which included 506 murders last year.

Unlike former presidents, Obama can’t deny that he has a deep understanding of the cycle of poverty, drugs and guns that plagues neighborhoods of cities like Chicago, said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had been calling for Obama to return home since soon after Pendleton was killed on Jan. 29.

“He knows the problems; he’s seen them; and this perfect storm of events means he’s coming home to talk about them,” Jackson said. “Because he knows, he can help illuminate the urban crisis and call out for real action.”

Emanuel discussed the visit in similar terms earlier in the week.

“Given that the lion’s share of both the perpetrators and the victims are young African-American men,” Emanuel asked, “who better to have that discussion than the president of the United States, who has repeatedly talked about fathering and the role of fathering?”

Obama’s most forceful moment of his State of the Union address Tuesday was when he implored Congress to vote on gun legislation. The victims “deserve a vote,” he said in a refrain that drew a standing ovation as he mentioned Pendleton, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and other victims of gun violence. Pendleton’s parents joined first lady Michelle Obama in the chamber for the speech a few days after she had traveled to Chicago with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett for the 15-year-old’s memorial service.",www.politico.com,left,BXVxjJISEtjh7u9J

( AP Photo/Sarah Rankin )
RICHMOND , Va. ( AP ) — Tens of thousands of gun-rights activists from around the country rallied peacefully at the Virginia Capitol on Monday to protest plans by the state ’ s Democratic leadership to pass gun-control legislation — a move that has become a key flash point in the national debate over gun violence .
The size of the crowd and the expected participation of white supremacists and fringe militia groups raised fears that the state could see a repeat of the violence that exploded in 2017 in Charlottesville . But the rally concluded uneventfully around noon , and the mood was largely festive , with rally-goers chanting “ USA ! ” and waving signs denouncing Democratic Gov . Ralph Northam .
Many protesters chose not to enter the designated rally zone , where Northam had imposed a temporary weapons ban , and instead packed surrounding streets , many dressed in tactical gear and camouflage and carrying military-style rifles as they cheered on the speakers .
“ I love this . This is like the Super Bowl for the Second Amendment right here , ” said P.J . Hudson , a truck driver from Richmond who carried an AR-15 rifle just outside Capitol Square . He was one of the few African American rally-goers in a crowd that was overwhelmingly white and male , and was frequently stopped and asked to pose for pictures wearing his “ Black Guns Matter ” sweatshirt .
An estimated 22,000 people attended , according to authorities , who said one woman was arrested on felony charge of wearing a mask in public .
The protesters came out despite the frigid temperature to send a message to legislators , they said .
Northam was a particular focus of the protesters ’ wrath . One poster showed his face superimposed on Adolf Hitler ’ s body .
The governor said in a statement he was “ thankful ” the day passed peacefully and that “ he will continue to listen to the voices ” of Virginians while doing everything in his power “ to keep our commonwealth safe . ”
“ The issues before us evoke strong emotions , and progress is often difficult , ” Northam said .
Democratic lawmakers said the rally wouldn ’ t impact their plans to pass gun-control measures , including universal background checks and a one-handgun-purchase-a-month limit . Democrats say tightening Virginia ’ s gun laws will make communities safer and help prevent mass shootings like the one last year in Virginia Beach , where a dozen people were killed in a municipal building .
“ I was prepared to see a whole lot more people show up than actually did and I think it ’ s an indication that a lot of this rhetoric is bluster , quite frankly , ” said Del . Chris Hurst , a gun-control advocate whose TV journalist girlfriend was killed in an on-air shooting in 2015 .
Some of the protesters waved flags with messages of support for President Donald Trump . Trump , in turn , tweeted support for their goals .

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Tens of thousands of gun-rights activists from around the country rallied peacefully at the Virginia Capitol on Monday to protest plans by the state’s Democratic leadership to pass gun-control legislation — a move that has become a key flash point in the national debate over gun violence.

The size of the crowd and the expected participation of white supremacists and fringe militia groups raised fears that the state could see a repeat of the violence that exploded in 2017 in Charlottesville. But the rally concluded uneventfully around noon, and the mood was largely festive, with rally-goers chanting “USA!” and waving signs denouncing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.

Many protesters chose not to enter the designated rally zone, where Northam had imposed a temporary weapons ban , and instead packed surrounding streets, many dressed in tactical gear and camouflage and carrying military-style rifles as they cheered on the speakers.

“I love this. This is like the Super Bowl for the Second Amendment right here,” said P.J. Hudson, a truck driver from Richmond who carried an AR-15 rifle just outside Capitol Square. He was one of the few African American rally-goers in a crowd that was overwhelmingly white and male, and was frequently stopped and asked to pose for pictures wearing his “Black Guns Matter” sweatshirt.

An estimated 22,000 people attended, according to authorities, who said one woman was arrested on felony charge of wearing a mask in public.

The protesters came out despite the frigid temperature to send a message to legislators, they said.

“The government doesn’t run us, we run the government,” said Kem Regik, a 20-year-old private security officer from northern Virginia who brought a white flag with a picture of a rifle captioned, “Come and take it.”

Northam was a particular focus of the protesters’ wrath. One poster showed his face superimposed on Adolf Hitler’s body.

The governor said in a statement he was “thankful” the day passed peacefully and that “he will continue to listen to the voices” of Virginians while doing everything in his power “to keep our commonwealth safe.”

“The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult,” Northam said.

Democratic lawmakers said the rally wouldn’t impact their plans to pass gun-control measures, including universal background checks and a one-handgun-purchase-a-month limit. Democrats say tightening Virginia’s gun laws will make communities safer and help prevent mass shootings like the one last year in Virginia Beach, where a dozen people were killed in a municipal building.

“I was prepared to see a whole lot more people show up than actually did and I think it’s an indication that a lot of this rhetoric is bluster, quite frankly,” said Del. Chris Hurst, a gun-control advocate whose TV journalist girlfriend was killed in an on-air shooting in 2015.

Some of the protesters waved flags with messages of support for President Donald Trump. Trump, in turn, tweeted support for their goals.

“The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,” he tweeted. “This is just the beginning. Don’t let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!

gun_control_and_gun_rights,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/politics/fact-check-joe-biden-gun-control/index.html,Fact check: Joe Biden's comments on gun control,2020-03-21,Holmes Lybrand,"( CNN ) Former Vice President Joe Biden , who 's the current front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary , made several gun-related claims recently during an argument with an auto worker and during a tele-townhall this week . We took a look at some of those claims to see what the facts were .
During a campaign stop at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant on March 10 , Biden was accused by one of the workers of wanting to take away people 's guns .
`` You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns , '' one man accused Biden .
`` You 're full of sh * * , '' Biden snapped back . `` I did not—no , no , shush . Shush . I support the Second Amendment . ''
Later , the man again accused Biden of saying he would take away guns in the US . `` You were with Beto when he said he was going to take our guns . ''
To which , Biden replied , `` I did not say that . That 's not true . I did not say that . ''
Facts First : Biden 's gun control plan does not include confiscating legally owned weapons and an interpretation of a `` viral video '' is a mishearing of what was said . The former vice president has said in the past that a Biden administration would come for people 's `` assault weapons . ''
Biden 's gun control plan outlines a buyback program for `` assault weapons and high-capacity magazines , '' but the program is not a mandatory buyback and would not force people to give their up their guns .
According to Biden 's website , the buyback program `` will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options : sell the weapons to the government , or register them under the National Firearms Act . ''
But in August 2019 , during an interview with CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Biden was asked about people who think a Biden administration `` means they 're going to come for my guns . '' Biden replied , `` Bingo , you 're right if you have an assault weapon . The fact of the matter is they should be illegal . Period . ''
When asked about this exchange , a Biden official told CNN , `` Joe Biden defeated the NRA to ban assault weapons before , and he was reminding viewers that as president he will do it again . ''
The auto worker 's reference to a video of Biden and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke likely refers to one of Biden talking with O'Rourke and his wife in a restaurant in Texas .
When talking about how O'Rourke has championed certain progressive issues , Biden said `` this guy ( O'Rourke ) can change the face of what we 're dealing with . With regard to guns -- assault weapons -- with regard to dealing with climate change . ''
`` And I just want to warn Amy ( O'Rourke 's wife ) , if I win , I 'm coming for him , '' Biden said , referring and pointing to O'Rourke , who has supported confiscating assault rifles from US citizens Some have mistakenly said that Biden was claiming he would come for US citizen 's guns , not O'Rourke , but Biden is talking about coming for `` him '' ( O'Rourke ) not `` 'em '' ( i.e . guns ) .
During the tele-town hall Monday , Biden was asked a question on guns and the Second Amendment and in his response , Biden talked about what are often called `` smart guns '' some of which require a fingerprint to fire .
Biden claimed that in response to smart gun tech `` the NRA and the gun manufactures came along and said 'if you keep selling them , we 're going to put you out of business . ' ''
Facts First : The National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a trade association for firearm manufacturers , told CNN they do not oppose smart guns but do oppose mandates of the technology .
Amy Hunter , director of media relations for the NRA , told CNN in a statement that `` Biden is wrong '' and that the NRA simply opposes government mandates for smart guns .
`` He should check his facts before opening his mouth , '' Hunter said . `` The NRA does not oppose smart gun technology . The NRA is opposed to government mandates that require consumers to only buy smart guns . That 's why we oppose any law that mandates when smart gun technology became available , all traditional firearms would become illegal . ''
One aspect of Biden 's gun safety plan is to `` put America on the path to ensuring that 100 % of firearms sold in America are smart guns '' and says `` Biden believes we should work to eventually require that 100 % of firearms sold in the US are smart guns . ''
Mark Oliva , director of public affairs at NSSF , told CNN regarding Biden 's statement about smart gun tech that `` the bottom line is this is categorically false . The industry has never made such a statement . ''
`` We represent the gun manufacturers , '' Oliva said , `` we have never opposed the technology , we have only opposed the mandate with the technology . '' Oliva also said the technology was not ready and that `` no police departments have adopted this technology because it just does n't work .
One issue facing `` smart guns '' is the New Jersey Childproof Handgun law which was passed in 2002 . That New Jersey law mandates that once what the law calls `` personalized '' ( i.e . smart ) guns are available in the US , all handguns sold in New Jersey must be such `` personalized '' guns .
Biofire , one of the companies working on smart gun technology , says on its website that `` the New Jersey mandate is a major roadblock to smart guns , and has been since it was passed 20 years ago . ''
Biden , arguing that the Second Amendment does not give everyone the right to own any firearm or weapon they want , said during the town hall that `` you 're not allowed to own , for example , a machine gun in the United States of America . ''
Facts First : Older machine guns , or fully automatics , can be purchased in the US , but there are many regulations which make it difficult to do so .
Private citizens who want to purchase a fully automatic weapon must buy it from someone with a Federal Firearms License -- which is necessary , among other things , to manufacture ammo and firearms and sell them as a major source of income . The gun must have been made and registered with the US government prior to May 19 , 1986 .
To transfer/purchase one of these machine guns there is transfer tax of $ 200 and the FFL holder must submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives which includes information about the gun as well as the transferee 's personal information , photo , fingerprints , and answers to questions to determine if the purchaser can legally possess the firearm .
The ATF will then review the form to determine if the transfer is legal and `` will not approve the form if the transfer , receipt , or possession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of any Federal , State , or local law . '' Only when the ATF approves the transfer — checking state and local laws that govern fully automatic weapons — can the gun be purchased .","(CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden , who's the current front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, made several gun-related claims recently during an argument with an auto worker and during a tele-townhall this week. We took a look at some of those claims to see what the facts were.

Gun rights

During a campaign stop at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant on March 10, Biden was accused by one of the workers of wanting to take away people's guns.

""You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns,"" one man accused Biden.

""You're full of sh**,"" Biden snapped back. ""I did not—no, no, shush. Shush. I support the Second Amendment.""

Later, the man again accused Biden of saying he would take away guns in the US. ""You were with Beto when he said he was going to take our guns.""

To which, Biden replied, ""I did not say that. That's not true. I did not say that.""

Facts First: Biden's gun control plan does not include confiscating legally owned weapons and an interpretation of a ""viral video"" is a mishearing of what was said. The former vice president has said in the past that a Biden administration would come for people's ""assault weapons.""

Biden's gun control plan outlines a buyback program for ""assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" but the program is not a mandatory buyback and would not force people to give their up their guns.

According to Biden's website, the buyback program ""will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.""

But in August 2019, during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Biden was asked about people who think a Biden administration ""means they're going to come for my guns."" Biden replied, ""Bingo, you're right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal. Period.""

When asked about this exchange, a Biden official told CNN, ""Joe Biden defeated the NRA to ban assault weapons before, and he was reminding viewers that as president he will do it again.""

The auto worker's reference to a video of Biden and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke likely refers to one of Biden talking with O'Rourke and his wife in a restaurant in Texas.

When talking about how O'Rourke has championed certain progressive issues, Biden said ""this guy (O'Rourke) can change the face of what we're dealing with. With regard to guns -- assault weapons -- with regard to dealing with climate change.""

""And I just want to warn Amy (O'Rourke's wife), if I win, I'm coming for him,"" Biden said, referring and pointing to O'Rourke, who has supported confiscating assault rifles from US citizens Some have mistakenly said that Biden was claiming he would come for US citizen's guns, not O'Rourke, but Biden is talking about coming for ""him"" (O'Rourke) not ""'em"" (i.e. guns).

Smart guns

During the tele-town hall Monday, Biden was asked a question on guns and the Second Amendment and in his response, Biden talked about what are often called ""smart guns"" some of which require a fingerprint to fire.

Biden claimed that in response to smart gun tech ""the NRA and the gun manufactures came along and said 'if you keep selling them, we're going to put you out of business.'""

Facts First: The National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for firearm manufacturers, told CNN they do not oppose smart guns but do oppose mandates of the technology.

Amy Hunter, director of media relations for the NRA, told CNN in a statement that ""Biden is wrong"" and that the NRA simply opposes government mandates for smart guns.

""He should check his facts before opening his mouth,"" Hunter said. ""The NRA does not oppose smart gun technology. The NRA is opposed to government mandates that require consumers to only buy smart guns. That's why we oppose any law that mandates when smart gun technology became available, all traditional firearms would become illegal.""

One aspect of Biden's gun safety plan is to ""put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns"" and says ""Biden believes we should work to eventually require that 100% of firearms sold in the US are smart guns.""

Mark Oliva, director of public affairs at NSSF, told CNN regarding Biden's statement about smart gun tech that ""the bottom line is this is categorically false. The industry has never made such a statement.""

""We represent the gun manufacturers,"" Oliva said, ""we have never opposed the technology, we have only opposed the mandate with the technology."" Oliva also said the technology was not ready and that ""no police departments have adopted this technology because it just doesn't work.

One issue facing ""smart guns"" is the New Jersey Childproof Handgun law which was passed in 2002. That New Jersey law mandates that once what the law calls ""personalized"" (i.e. smart) guns are available in the US, all handguns sold in New Jersey must be such ""personalized"" guns.

Biofire, one of the companies working on smart gun technology, says on its website that ""the New Jersey mandate is a major roadblock to smart guns, and has been since it was passed 20 years ago.""

Machine guns

Biden, arguing that the Second Amendment does not give everyone the right to own any firearm or weapon they want, said during the town hall that ""you're not allowed to own, for example, a machine gun in the United States of America.""

Facts First: Older machine guns, or fully automatics, can be purchased in the US, but there are many regulations which make it difficult to do so.

Private citizens who want to purchase a fully automatic weapon must buy it from someone with a Federal Firearms License -- which is necessary, among other things, to manufacture ammo and firearms and sell them as a major source of income. The gun must have been made and registered with the US government prior to May 19, 1986.

To transfer/purchase one of these machine guns there is transfer tax of $200 and the FFL holder must submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives which includes information about the gun as well as the transferee's personal information, photo, fingerprints, and answers to questions to determine if the purchaser can legally possess the firearm.

The ATF will then review the form to determine if the transfer is legal and ""will not approve the form if the transfer, receipt, or possession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of any Federal, State, or local law."" Only when the ATF approves the transfer — checking state and local laws that govern fully automatic weapons — can the gun be purchased.",www.cnn.com,left,9t1IBxb9nZ9AbC3h

Tuccille, Eric Boehm, Orin S. Kerr, Charles Oliver, David Post, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Shikha Dalmia","While serving in the U.S. Navy more than three decades ago , Chad Linton pleaded guilty to driving under the influence , a misdemeanor , and attempting to evade a police vehicle , a Class C felony , in Island County , Washington . More than four decades ago , when he was 18 , Paul Stewart was found guilty of first-degree burglary , a felony , after hopping a fence and stealing tools from an unlocked telephone company truck in Yuma County , Arizona . In both cases , the felony convictions were eventually vacated , and both men 's firearm rights were restored .
But not according to the state of California , where Linton and Stewart have long led law-abiding lives . The California Department of Justice ( DOJ ) maintains that their vacated felony convictions forever disqualify them from buying or possessing guns . Last week Linton and Stewart , joined by the Firearms Policy Coalition and three other gun rights groups , filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco , arguing that California 's policy violates the Second Amendment , the Full Faith and Credit Clause , and the Privileges and Immunities Clause .
California law , like federal law , prohibits people with felony convictions from owning firearms . On its face , that provision does not apply to people like Linton and Stewart , since their felony records have been vacated and therefore no longer exist as far the courts of conviction are concerned . Yet the California DOJ has told them that the state does not recognize those legal facts .
Both men , after thinking they had cleared up the matter , have attempted to buy firearms , only to be told that they are not legally allowed to do so in California . In Linton 's case , the DOJ 's Bureau of Firearms sent agents to his home in San Bernardino County last April and confiscated several guns he had legally purchased ( or so he thought ) after passing background checks . The complaint says the agents , after seeing Washington court documents showing that Linton 's conviction had been vacated and his firearm rights restored , thought his guns should be returned , but they were overruled by Deputy Attorney General Robert Wilson .
According to the complaint , Wilson told Linton 's attorney , Adam Richards , during a telephone conversation in September that Linton 's only remedy would be a presidential pardon—an odd suggestion , not only because his conviction had been vacated but because the president does not have the power to pardon state crimes . `` During our call , '' Richards said in a December 4 letter to Wilson that is included as an exhibit in the lawsuit , `` you stated that the only measure that would restore [ Linton 's ] rights , according to your Department , is a presidential pardon . As I informed you during our conversation , I strongly disagree with the Department 's position as I believe it to be arbitrary and capricious for several reasons . ''
Richards rejected Wilson 's argument that California need not take into account the actions of courts in other states . `` Your position that Washington orders have no authority over California is irrelevant and misses the crux of the issue , '' he wrote . `` Washington courts are not seeking to modify a California order or case . Instead , the question of whether Mr. Linton was convicted of a felony resides with the jurisdiction in which the conviction allegedly occurred . Mr. Linton has no record in the State of California and now , effectively , has no record in the State of Washington . ''
The lawsuit says the DOJ 's insistence that Linton and Stewart should still be treated as felons under California law represents `` a total and permanent deprivation of their fundamental , individual right to keep and bear arms and ammunition , as guaranteed by the Second Amendment . '' Linton et al . argue that the policy `` can not be justified , and therefore fail [ s ] to satisfy any level or mode of scrutiny at all , let alone the heightened scrutiny that is required to deprive individuals of such fundamental rights . ''
The complaint says the policy also violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause , which `` requires each State to recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by the courts of its sister States , '' and the Privileges and Immunities Clause , which `` was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures into State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy . '' Although California itself has a process for restoring the gun rights of people with in-state felony convictions when they are downgraded to misdemeanors , `` California refuses to honor the comparable process utilized by other states . ''
The lawsuit portrays California 's treatment of Linton and Stewart as part of a general hostility toward gun ownership . `` In their zeal to prohibit as many citizens from owning firearms as possible , '' it says , California officials are `` ignor [ ing ] the judgments and pronouncements of the courts of other states….The State has no constitutionally permissible interest in depriving individuals of their right to own , possess , and bear firearms for all lawful purposes , including self-defense in their homes , when any underlying convictions were remote , non-violent in nature , and adjudged to have been vacated or set aside in those other jurisdictions .

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/16/obama-weighs-1-executive-actions-on-gun-control/,White House draws criticism ahead of gun control announcement,2013-01-16,,"President Obama will unveil a comprehensive effort to address gun violence as he calls on Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of an aggressive agenda that is drawing resistance from some Republican lawmakers and gun rights advocates .
The president , facing criticism over his potential use of executive action to push multiple gun control measures , will be joined by children who wrote him letters about gun violence and school safety at a press conference shortly before noon on Wednesday .
`` ( Obama ) believes and knows that most all gun owners are highly responsible , they buy their guns legally , and they use them safely , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday . `` He also has seen and believes that most gun owners support the idea of commonsense measures to prevent people who should n't have guns from getting them . ''
Carney , without getting into specifics , vowed a `` comprehensive approach . '' Two Democratic aides later confirmed that the legislative plank would include a push for universal background checks , a ban on high-capacity magazines and renewal of the assault weapons ban .
The announcement -- the product of a task force led by Vice President Biden -- is cloaked in controversy . That the announcement would include children as a backdrop added another level .
Roger Pilon , with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute , criticized the staging as `` tacky , '' saying Obama has `` carved up the population on a very emotional issue . ''
Yet in the wake of a school massacre last month in Connecticut that left 20 first-graders dead , as well as six educators , the president has stressed that children 's lives could be on the line . Obama , like prior presidents , often invites members of the public to act as a backdrop for certain policy announcements . They are always carefully selected -- over the summer , he invited college students for a speech about student loan rates and middle-class taxpayers to another talk on extending tax rates . The White House has also invited doctors for speeches on the health care overhaul .
The substance of Obama 's announcement Wednesday , though , is likely to cause the biggest stir .
Sources say he 's weighing as many as 19 possible actions he could take through executive order . Those options could include more aggressively enforcing existing gun laws , beefing up national research on guns and ordering stricter action against people who lie on gun sale background checks . They could include ordering tougher penalties for gun-trafficking offenses and ordering federal agencies to make data on gun crimes more readily available .
Carney on Tuesday declined to specify what actions the president might take via executive order .
The president , though , has already voiced support for separate legislative measures in Congress , like the renewal of the assault weapons ban . That is expected to face the toughest opposition in Congress . But Biden , who led the gun violence task force and met with the president Monday , indicated the group is also pressing for limits on high-capacity magazines -- as well as background checks for anyone seeking to purchase a gun .

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says some 40 percent of gun sales happen with no background checks , such as at gun shows and by private sellers over the Internet or through classified ads .","President Obama will unveil a comprehensive effort to address gun violence as he calls on Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of an aggressive agenda that is drawing resistance from some Republican lawmakers and gun rights advocates.

The president, facing criticism over his potential use of executive action to push multiple gun control measures, will be joined by children who wrote him letters about gun violence and school safety at a press conference shortly before noon on Wednesday.

""(Obama) believes and knows that most all gun owners are highly responsible, they buy their guns legally, and they use them safely,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""He also has seen and believes that most gun owners support the idea of commonsense measures to prevent people who shouldn't have guns from getting them.""

Carney, without getting into specifics, vowed a ""comprehensive approach."" Two Democratic aides later confirmed that the legislative plank would include a push for universal background checks, a ban on high-capacity magazines and renewal of the assault weapons ban.

The announcement -- the product of a task force led by Vice President Biden -- is cloaked in controversy. That the announcement would include children as a backdrop added another level.

Roger Pilon, with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, criticized the staging as ""tacky,"" saying Obama has ""carved up the population on a very emotional issue.""

Yet in the wake of a school massacre last month in Connecticut that left 20 first-graders dead, as well as six educators, the president has stressed that children's lives could be on the line. Obama, like prior presidents, often invites members of the public to act as a backdrop for certain policy announcements. They are always carefully selected -- over the summer, he invited college students for a speech about student loan rates and middle-class taxpayers to another talk on extending tax rates. The White House has also invited doctors for speeches on the health care overhaul.

The substance of Obama's announcement Wednesday, though, is likely to cause the biggest stir.

Sources say he's weighing as many as 19 possible actions he could take through executive order. Those options could include more aggressively enforcing existing gun laws, beefing up national research on guns and ordering stricter action against people who lie on gun sale background checks. They could include ordering tougher penalties for gun-trafficking offenses and ordering federal agencies to make data on gun crimes more readily available.

Carney on Tuesday declined to specify what actions the president might take via executive order.

The president, though, has already voiced support for separate legislative measures in Congress, like the renewal of the assault weapons ban. That is expected to face the toughest opposition in Congress. But Biden, who led the gun violence task force and met with the president Monday, indicated the group is also pressing for limits on high-capacity magazines -- as well as background checks for anyone seeking to purchase a gun. Carney reiterated Tuesday that Obama still wants those measures pursued.

Such changes ""make sense,"" Obama said. He said lawmakers will have to ""examine their own conscience"" in the debate ahead.

Biden said in a wide-ranging magazine interview that gun-control legislation will pass eventually because several senators who voted against it are experiencing a public backlash .
“ To use the vernacular , there ’ s suddenly a lot of senators out there who have seen the Lord , ” Mr. Biden told Rolling Stone magazine . “ You find out that the senator from New Hampshire [ Republican Kelly Ayotte ] is in trouble ; she voted no . I can name you four senators who called me and said , “ Jesus , I guess you were right — maybe we can find some other way of doing this . Can we bring this back up ? ”
He said four senators who voted against expanded background checks of gun purchases in April have since approached him to say they ’ ve changed their minds .
In the hour-long interview , Mr. Biden also sounded like a candidate for the presidency in 2016 , explaining at great length how much time he spends with President Obama on major decisions . He said he spends four or five hours each day with the president .
“ It ’ s been a really good relationship , and everybody knows that — around here and around the world , ” Mr. Biden said . “ I speak for the president because of the relationship . And the only way that works is if you ’ re around all the time . Literally , every meeting he has , I ’ m in . ”
On Mr. Biden declaring his support for gay marriage last year before Mr. Obama did :
“ I got blowback from everybody but the president . I walked in that Monday , he had a big grin on his face , he put his arms around me and said , ‘ Well , Joe , God love you , you say what you think. ’ I knew he agreed with me . It wasn ’ t like he was in a different place . ”
On not taking direct military action against Syria following reports that the regime has used chemical-weapons :
“ With all the credibility we ’ ve gained in the world , we don ’ t want to blow it like the last administration did in Iraq , saying ‘ weapons of mass destruction. ’ We know that there have been traces found of what are probably chemical weapons . What we don ’ t know yet — and we ’ re drilling down on it as hard as we can — is whether they were accidentally released in an exchange of gunfire or artillery fire , or blown up or something . It ’ s probable , but we don ’ t know for certain , that they were used by the regime . ”
On his speech in which he called the accused Boston Marathon bombers “ cowardly , knock-off jihadis ” :
“ I wanted to communicate two things : first , to make it clear that there is not this sort of gigantic , coordinated network run by al Qaeda that has cells all around the country and , second , that the republic is not in jeopardy and there ’ s no reason for us to jettison the Constitution and erect a police state in order to protect people . The moment we change , they win . ”","Vice President Joseph R. Biden said in a wide-ranging magazine interview that gun-control legislation will pass eventually because several senators who voted against it are experiencing a public backlash.

“To use the vernacular, there’s suddenly a lot of senators out there who have seen the Lord,” Mr. Biden told Rolling Stone magazine. “You find out that the senator from New Hampshire [Republican Kelly Ayotte] is in trouble; she voted no. I can name you four senators who called me and said, “Jesus, I guess you were right — maybe we can find some other way of doing this. Can we bring this back up?”

He said four senators who voted against expanded background checks of gun purchases in April have since approached him to say they’ve changed their minds.

In the hour-long interview, Mr. Biden also sounded like a candidate for the presidency in 2016, explaining at great length how much time he spends with President Obama on major decisions. He said he spends four or five hours each day with the president.

“It’s been a really good relationship, and everybody knows that — around here and around the world,” Mr. Biden said. “I speak for the president because of the relationship. And the only way that works is if you’re around all the time. Literally, every meeting he has, I’m in.”

Some other highlights from the interview:

On Mr. Biden declaring his support for gay marriage last year before Mr. Obama did:

“I got blowback from everybody but the president. I walked in that Monday, he had a big grin on his face, he put his arms around me and said, ‘Well, Joe, God love you, you say what you think.’ I knew he agreed with me. It wasn’t like he was in a different place.”

On not taking direct military action against Syria following reports that the regime has used chemical-weapons:

“With all the credibility we’ve gained in the world, we don’t want to blow it like the last administration did in Iraq, saying ‘weapons of mass destruction.’ We know that there have been traces found of what are probably chemical weapons. What we don’t know yet — and we’re drilling down on it as hard as we can — is whether they were accidentally released in an exchange of gunfire or artillery fire, or blown up or something. It’s probable, but we don’t know for certain, that they were used by the regime.”

On his speech in which he called the accused Boston Marathon bombers “cowardly, knock-off jihadis”:

“I wanted to communicate two things: first, to make it clear that there is not this sort of gigantic, coordinated network run by al Qaeda that has cells all around the country and, second, that the republic is not in jeopardy and there’s no reason for us to jettison the Constitution and erect a police state in order to protect people. The moment we change, they win.”

Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said FBI bungling , mental illness and lax school security were at the root of the Valentine ’ s Day shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . He said the solution is better protection , not tighter gun laws .
“ Our banks , our airports , our NBA games , our NFL games , our office buildings , our movie stars , our politicians — they ’ re all more protected than our children at school . Does that make any sense to anybody ? ” Mr. LaPierre told a Washington audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference , a gathering of grass-roots leaders on the right .
His annual speech to CPAC is always compelling , but this year ’ s version was all the more so because of the timing , giving Mr. LaPierre a chance to respond to the NRA ’ s critics , a group that now includes many of the students who survived the Florida shooting . Some of the survivors are leading a nationwide effort to enact strict controls on what weapons can be bought and who can buy them .
Mr. LaPierre , though , warned against “ opportunists ” using the tragedy to advance a “ socialist agenda ” that begins with denying gun rights . He said the response to the shooting should be careful and targeted .
“ Demand what works , ” he said . “ Put armed security in every school . Fix the broken mental health system . Enforce the federal gun laws against every criminal thug on the street . Prosecute dangerous people when they show up to buy a gun . And , for God ’ s sake , put every prohibited person into the system . That ’ s what common-sense gun laws look like . ”
He said the NRA will provide free support through its School Shield program to help any school place armed security guards in its hallways .
The “ good guy with a gun ” philosophy is also being advanced by the White House . President Trump this week talked about offering bonuses to teachers who are willing to take training and then arm themselves on school grounds .
Mr. LaPierre also said his organization supports efforts to ensure that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System gets all the records it is supposed to have . He said states leave out at least 7 million felony convictions that could be in the system .
He also called for more prosecutions of those on the banned list who try to buy weapons .
“ In 2010 , roughly 80,000 prohibited people committed a felony by trying to buy a gun . Just 44 were prosecuted for it . Does that sound like a good number to anybody ? ” he said . “ So , when you hear politicians who won ’ t fix the broken system talk about expanding it , don ’ t buy it . ”
Mr. LaPierre said the NRA will oppose expanding the system to include people whom the government has flagged for potential mental health problems but who have never officially been adjudicated mentally deficient . The Obama administration made several such efforts in its waning days .
Adding more mental health records into NICS appears to be one area with broad support among people on both sides of the gun issue .
“ In some of that speech , he had some good things to say about the background check system , ” said Avery Gardiner , co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . “ That ’ s good — we should get more records into the background check system , absolutely . ”
Ms. Gardiner also said , though , that the NRA supported a legal effort during the 1990s challenging the entire Brady gun bill — which initially set up the background check system — as unconstitutional .
Some of the students from Stoneman Douglas have made the NRA their chief target in the aftermath of the shooting . They have taken to Twitter and crusading cable news networks to criticize those who have worked with the gun rights group and vowed to deny them funding .
Mr. LaPierre , though , criticized “ the shameful politicization of tragedy ” by Democrats and the news media .
“ They hate the NRA . They hate the Second Amendment . They hate individual freedom , ” he said . “ Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment . ”
He name-checked a handful of potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders as among those opponents : Sens . Kamala D. Harris of California , Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , and Cory A. Booker of New Jersey , as well as New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo .
“ If they seize power — if these so-called new European socialists take over the House and the Senate , and God forbid they get the White House again — our American freedoms could be lost , and our country will be changed forever , ” he said .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , shot back by saying the NRA refuses to accept the role access to guns played in last week ’ s shooting . He also lamented what he described as undue influence the group holds over congressional Republicans and President Trump .
“ The NRA is once again spewing pathetic , out-of-touch ideas , blaming everything but guns , ” he said .
Ms. Harris , who as California ’ s attorney general fought in court to preserve the state ’ s tough gun laws , vowed to deepen the fight for gun control .
“ I am not going to be silenced by attacks from the NRA or anyone else — and neither will my Senate colleagues or the students from Stoneman Douglas . It ’ s time to stand up to the gun lobby and keep our communities safe , ” she said on Twitter .
That message was not a big seller at CPAC , where attendees sided with Mr. LaPierre in fearing broad bans on the style of semi-automatic rifles used in the Florida attack and other recent mass shootings .
“ I don ’ t think banning weapons is the right thing to do , ” said Connor Graves , 19 . “ I think it is more about a mental health issue than a gun issue .
“ I am from South Dakota , and we have a lot of guns and not a lot of shootings , ” he said . “ I see it as more of a social issue than a gun issue . I actually have an AR-15 at home , and I haven ’ t shot anyone . ”","The National Rifle Association offered free help to schools that hire armed guards to protect their students and backed expansion of the federal government’s list of banned guy buyers, but it defiantly warned Thursday against Washington’s overreach after last week’s school massacre.

Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said FBI bungling, mental illness and lax school security were at the root of the Valentine’s Day shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He said the solution is better protection, not tighter gun laws.

“Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians — they’re all more protected than our children at school. Does that make any sense to anybody?” Mr. LaPierre told a Washington audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of grass-roots leaders on the right.

His annual speech to CPAC is always compelling, but this year’s version was all the more so because of the timing, giving Mr. LaPierre a chance to respond to the NRA’s critics, a group that now includes many of the students who survived the Florida shooting. Some of the survivors are leading a nationwide effort to enact strict controls on what weapons can be bought and who can buy them.

Mr. LaPierre, though, warned against “opportunists” using the tragedy to advance a “socialist agenda” that begins with denying gun rights. He said the response to the shooting should be careful and targeted.

“Demand what works,” he said. “Put armed security in every school. Fix the broken mental health system. Enforce the federal gun laws against every criminal thug on the street. Prosecute dangerous people when they show up to buy a gun. And, for God’s sake, put every prohibited person into the system. That’s what common-sense gun laws look like.”

He said the NRA will provide free support through its School Shield program to help any school place armed security guards in its hallways.

The “good guy with a gun” philosophy is also being advanced by the White House. President Trump this week talked about offering bonuses to teachers who are willing to take training and then arm themselves on school grounds.

Mr. LaPierre also said his organization supports efforts to ensure that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System gets all the records it is supposed to have. He said states leave out at least 7 million felony convictions that could be in the system.

He also called for more prosecutions of those on the banned list who try to buy weapons.

“In 2010, roughly 80,000 prohibited people committed a felony by trying to buy a gun. Just 44 were prosecuted for it. Does that sound like a good number to anybody?” he said. “So, when you hear politicians who won’t fix the broken system talk about expanding it, don’t buy it.”

Ms. Gardiner also said, though, that the NRA supported a legal effort during the 1990s challenging the entire Brady gun bill — which initially set up the background check system — as unconstitutional.

“So it comes across as very disingenuous,” she said.

“ Prior to purchasing a first gun , most have had some form of instruction , formal or informal , ” said Laura Kippen , the author of the study . “ After the purchase , approximately two-thirds of first-time gun buyers obtained some form of training for their gun . ”
Other analysts said that figures focusing on first-time buyers do not capture the gun-owning population as a whole , and less than half of the people who own military-style , semi-automatic rifles — akin to the kinds used in mass shootings in recent years — buy them from the retailers who are subject to background checks .

That figure stems from a 1997 National Institute of Justice study that sampled 2,568 households ; just 251 people answered the question in the broad survey about where they obtained their guns .

Further , a 2010 report from the NSSF found that 40 percent of people who bought “ modern sporting rifles , ” such as the popular AR-15 , purchased them at independent retailers .

In an interview with the BBC last week , Mr. Obama spoke of both issues in the same breath , saying he is encouraged by the bipartisan movement to overhaul the nation ’ s criminal justice system and believes it ’ s an important piece of a broader effort to improve race relations in the U.S .
The president also candidly said gun control represents the biggest frustration of his time in office , as all attempts to restrict firearms have been met with stiff resistance and gone nowhere .
Analysts say the two issues , while somewhat related , are distinctly different both in substance and politics . Republicans and Democrats increasingly are finding common ground on criminal justice reform and view it as a way to both better society and save money by shrinking the U.S. prison population .
Gun control , specialists say , is an entirely different ballgame . There ’ s no consensus on Capitol Hill — or across the nation — that background checks legislation , for example , would ’ ve prevented any of the mass shootings seen across the nation in recent years , including last week ’ s attack at a Louisiana movie theater .
The political power of groups such as the National Rifle Association also plays a central role in the gun control debate . No similarly powerful organization exists in the discussion about criminal justice reform .
Still , for Mr. Obama , gun control and criminal justice reform seem to fall under a larger umbrella . Both must be tackled , he argues , to move the country forward .
“ Some of the most recent concerns around policing and mass incarcerations are legitimate and deserve intense attention . And I feel that we are moving the ball forward on those issues . What I will say is that eight years — well , after eight years of my presidency — that children growing up during these eight years will have a different view of race relations in this country and what ’ s possible , ” Mr. Obama told the BBC before turning the discussion to gun control .
“ You mentioned the issue of guns . That is an area where , if you ask me where has been the one area where I feel that I ’ ve been most frustrated and most stymied , it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient commonsense gun safety laws . Even in the face of repeated mass killings , ” he continued .
“ And you know , if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism , it ’ s less than 100 . If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence , it ’ s in the tens of thousands . And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing . ”
Some analysts say Mr. Obama is right to link criminal justice reform and gun violence , especially because both issues are now very much at the forefront of the national political dialogue .
“ We hear talk about ‘ good guys with guns stopping bad guys with guns , ’ but we have a criminal justice system that spends too much time labeling many nonviolent people as ‘ bad. ’ At the same time our gun laws allow for people who appear to be ‘ good ’ to access guns and commit mass murders , ” said Montre Carodine , a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law who has written extensively on race relations .
“ Bottom line , we have more people in prison than ever today , but many of us are scared to go to the movies tonight . So something is clearly amiss , ” he said .
Changes to the criminal justice system seem to be on the horizon . Leading Republicans and Democrats support legislation that would keep more nonviolent drug offenders out of prison and steer them toward treatment programs , house arrest or other alternatives to incarceration .
The issue appeals to virtually all sides of the political spectrum , analysts say , because it addresses social justice and race relations , a top priority for most Democrats , while also drawing in fiscal conservatives because of the money that can be saved by reducing the federal prison population .
“ Everybody has some issue they care about wrapped up in criminal justice reform , ” said Trevor Burrus , a research fellow at the Cato Institute ’ s Center for Constitutional Studies .
As criminal justice reform moves closer to reality , gun control seems to become less likely each day . Mr. Obama began his major push for gun control legislation following the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , and has continued that push in the aftermath of other shooting rampages over the past several years .
Despite some bipartisan support , a bill to expand background checks for gun purchases died on Capitol Hill two years ago . No other major gun control bills have made any progress in the House or Senate since then .
The failure of the background checks bill , analysts say , explains the central difference between gun control and criminal justice reform and why the two can not be linked , at least not in the political realm .
“ We have this very intense interest represented by the National Rifle Association that is focused exclusively on guns and regulations .

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/merrick-garland-has-very-liberal-view-gun-rights/,Merrick Garland has ‘very liberal view of gun rights’,2016-03-16,"Dave Boyer, David Sherfinski","President Obama tried to tap a moderate to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , but he ended up picking a fight with powerful Second Amendment groups that say Judge Merrick Garland has shown antipathy toward gun rights .
In one 2000 case , Judge Garland , who sits on the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , upheld a Clinton administration effort to store gun-buyers ’ records .
Later in the decade , he joined other judges in a failed bid to reconsider the landmark case that would eventually establish the Second Amendment ’ s protection of a personal right to bear arms .
“ This is probably the most anti-gun Supreme Court nomination in decades , ” said Brian Rogers , executive director of America Rising Squared , a conservative group conducting opposition research on Judge Garland .
Judge Garland was appointed to the D.C. circuit in 1997 after surviving a contentious Senate fight that centered more on whether that court needed another judge than on whether he was the right pick .
Now , Judge Garland faces a similar fight . Republican senators say the Supreme Court can operate with eight justices until next year , when voters will have had a chance to choose the president whom they want to make the pick .
In the meantime , conservative groups have begun poring over Judge Garland ’ s 19-year record on the D.C. court and say even in the early stages of vetting , his association with Mr. Obama means he likely will take decidedly liberal views on issues such as abortion , the environment and executive authority .
“ We do not know this nominee , but we do know Barack Obama , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List . “ Anyone he nominates will join the voting bloc on the court that consistently upholds abortion on demand . ”
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , a Republican presidential candidate , said Judge Garland is the kind of nominee people get “ when you make deals in Washington , D.C . ”
“ Make no mistake : If Garland were confirmed , he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment , legalizing partial-birth abortion and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS , ” Mr. Cruz said .
For many groups , the association with Mr. Obama alone was enough to tarnish Judge Garland ’ s nomination .
“ President Obama has nothing but contempt for the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners , ” said Chris W. Cox , executive director of the National Rifle Association ’ s Institute for Legislative Action . “ Obama has already nominated two Supreme Court justices who oppose the right to own firearms , and there is absolutely no reason to think he has changed his approach this time . ”
Erich Pratt , executive director of the group Gun Owners of America , said Mr. Obama chose a “ radical leftist ” in Judge Garland despite promises to nominate a consensus candidate .
“ He supported the D.C. gun ban in 2007 , thereby showing he opposes self-defense and opposes the right to keep and bear arms , ” Mr. Pratt said .
That 2007 case , Parker v. District of Columbia , ultimately became the landmark Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller . Before it reached the high court , it was heard in Judge Garland ’ s circuit , and a three-judge panel ruled that the D.C. handgun ban was unconstitutional . Judge Garland wasn ’ t part of that decision , but he did join three other judges in trying to have the full court get a chance to overturn the ruling .
Carrie Severino , chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative advocacy group , concluded in a recent piece for National Review that the 2007 vote means Judge Garland would ultimately support overturning the Supreme Court ’ s Heller decision and that he has a “ very liberal view of gun rights. ” Ms. Severino ’ s group has pledged a $ 2 million advertising campaign to oppose Mr. Obama ’ s nominee .
Republican senators had already decided to block the nomination process , citing election-year precedent in saying the next president should be the one to fill the vacancy .
The offices of several pro-gun Democrats did not offer a comment on Judge Garland ’ s record .
But House Republicans said the judge ’ s gun record must be part of any debate .
“ In 2007 , Garland tried to inflict one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country , ignoring the Second Amendment rights for residents of the District of Columbia , ” said Rep. John Fleming , a Louisiana Republican who is running for the U.S. Senate this year .
Rep. Blake Farenthold , Texas Republican , also said he hopes the Senate “ takes a strong stand against a nominee that has shown he is no friend to the Constitution and no friend to the right to keep and bear arms . ”
Conservatives are also pointing to a 2000 case in which Mr. Garland was part of a 2-1 panel that voted to uphold a Clinton administration policy of retaining certain gun transaction records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for six months . Conservatives argued that the records retention ran counter to rules against gun registries in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and a 1993 law that created the system .
That decision , Mr. Pratt said , shows that Mr. Garland is “ anti-gun ” and that “ he supports the ability of a president to illegally use executive power to advance liberal causes . ”
The reliance on executive actions has come to define much of Mr. Obama ’ s legacy , as he has been roundly criticized for going around Congress and acting unilaterally on issues such as gun rights , immigration and climate change .
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama picked the best person for the job and “ it ’ s not as if the president had a punch list of hot-button items that he used to quiz potential nominees . ”
“ The president ’ s much more interested in an individual ’ s approach to the job , knowing that … interpreting the law based on the specifics of the case is what their responsibility is , ” Mr . Earnest said .
Meanwhile , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , which has pushed to expand the Brady Bill background checks , said Wednesday that Republicans pledging to block Mr. Garland ’ s nomination are taking their lead from the “ corporate gun lobby ” instead of the Constitution .
“ The gun industry understands the balance of the court is up for grabs and they ’ re not taking any chances of confirming a justice who may side with constitutional , sensible gun laws , ” said Dan Gross , president of the group .","President Obama tried to tap a moderate to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but he ended up picking a fight with powerful Second Amendment groups that say Judge Merrick Garland has shown antipathy toward gun rights.

In one 2000 case, Judge Garland, who sits on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, upheld a Clinton administration effort to store gun-buyers’ records.

Later in the decade, he joined other judges in a failed bid to reconsider the landmark case that would eventually establish the Second Amendment’s protection of a personal right to bear arms.

“This is probably the most anti-gun Supreme Court nomination in decades,” said Brian Rogers, executive director of America Rising Squared, a conservative group conducting opposition research on Judge Garland.

Judge Garland was appointed to the D.C. circuit in 1997 after surviving a contentious Senate fight that centered more on whether that court needed another judge than on whether he was the right pick.

Now, Judge Garland faces a similar fight. Republican senators say the Supreme Court can operate with eight justices until next year, when voters will have had a chance to choose the president whom they want to make the pick.

In the meantime, conservative groups have begun poring over Judge Garland’s 19-year record on the D.C. court and say even in the early stages of vetting, his association with Mr. Obama means he likely will take decidedly liberal views on issues such as abortion, the environment and executive authority.

“We do not know this nominee, but we do know Barack Obama,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List. “Anyone he nominates will join the voting bloc on the court that consistently upholds abortion on demand.”

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, said Judge Garland is the kind of nominee people get “when you make deals in Washington, D.C.”

“Make no mistake: If Garland were confirmed, he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment, legalizing partial-birth abortion and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS,” Mr. Cruz said.

For many groups, the association with Mr. Obama alone was enough to tarnish Judge Garland’s nomination.

“President Obama has nothing but contempt for the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. “Obama has already nominated two Supreme Court justices who oppose the right to own firearms, and there is absolutely no reason to think he has changed his approach this time.”

Erich Pratt, executive director of the group Gun Owners of America, said Mr. Obama chose a “radical leftist” in Judge Garland despite promises to nominate a consensus candidate.

“He supported the D.C. gun ban in 2007, thereby showing he opposes self-defense and opposes the right to keep and bear arms,” Mr. Pratt said.

That 2007 case, Parker v. District of Columbia, ultimately became the landmark Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller. Before it reached the high court, it was heard in Judge Garland’s circuit, and a three-judge panel ruled that the D.C. handgun ban was unconstitutional. Judge Garland wasn’t part of that decision, but he did join three other judges in trying to have the full court get a chance to overturn the ruling.

Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group, concluded in a recent piece for National Review that the 2007 vote means Judge Garland would ultimately support overturning the Supreme Court’s Heller decision and that he has a “very liberal view of gun rights.” Ms. Severino’s group has pledged a $2 million advertising campaign to oppose Mr. Obama’s nominee.

Republican senators had already decided to block the nomination process, citing election-year precedent in saying the next president should be the one to fill the vacancy.

The offices of several pro-gun Democrats did not offer a comment on Judge Garland’s record.

But House Republicans said the judge’s gun record must be part of any debate.

“In 2007, Garland tried to inflict one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, ignoring the Second Amendment rights for residents of the District of Columbia,” said Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican who is running for the U.S. Senate this year.

Rep. Blake Farenthold, Texas Republican, also said he hopes the Senate “takes a strong stand against a nominee that has shown he is no friend to the Constitution and no friend to the right to keep and bear arms.”

Conservatives are also pointing to a 2000 case in which Mr. Garland was part of a 2-1 panel that voted to uphold a Clinton administration policy of retaining certain gun transaction records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for six months. Conservatives argued that the records retention ran counter to rules against gun registries in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and a 1993 law that created the system.

That decision, Mr. Pratt said, shows that Mr. Garland is “anti-gun” and that “he supports the ability of a president to illegally use executive power to advance liberal causes.”

The reliance on executive actions has come to define much of Mr. Obama’s legacy, as he has been roundly criticized for going around Congress and acting unilaterally on issues such as gun rights, immigration and climate change.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama picked the best person for the job and “it’s not as if the president had a punch list of hot-button items that he used to quiz potential nominees.”

“The president’s much more interested in an individual’s approach to the job, knowing that … interpreting the law based on the specifics of the case is what their responsibility is,” Mr. Earnest said.

Meanwhile, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has pushed to expand the Brady Bill background checks, said Wednesday that Republicans pledging to block Mr. Garland’s nomination are taking their lead from the “corporate gun lobby” instead of the Constitution.

“The gun industry understands the balance of the court is up for grabs and they’re not taking any chances of confirming a justice who may side with constitutional, sensible gun laws,” said Dan Gross, president of the group.

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Media Matters,0,http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/05/02/meet-the-glocker-moms/199128,Meet The Glocker Moms,2014-05-02,,"INDIANAPOLIS -- The theme of last week 's National Rifle Association annual meeting was an odd one : maternity .
It was not an official theme in the way macho slogans like “ All In ” and “ Stand and Fight ” have formally defined recent NRA congresses . But it was a thick running thread , one that signals the quickening of a broad shift underway across the gun rights movement , from the gun makers to the grassroots .
Red schwag set the tone . At tables throughout the complex , NRA staffers handed out “ I 'm an NRA MOM ” buttons and t-shirts . At the building 's main entrance hung an enormous banner of a woman , looking a little pouty , next to a populist taunt of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who recently said he would spend big on behalf of the gun safety movement .
While it is unclear if the woman is an NRA mom , she is notably not NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre or board member Ted Nugent . The billboard captures perfectly the NRA 's double-pronged messaging campaign of the moment , best summarized as “ Glocker Moms against Mayor Mike . ”
For years the role of women in the politics and business of guns has been growing . We may look back at 2014 as the year it flipped . In Indianapolis , women constituted a full quarter of NRA attendees for the first time -- up to a five-fold increase over the past decade , according to the group .
The NRA is pivoting quickly to adjust , and for the first time its convention program featured two major events for women . In addition to the $ 250-a-plate Women 's Leadership Forum Luncheon and Auction , the group held the first annual Women 's New Energy Breakfast , where female gun owners and NRA moms mixed and networked over a $ 15 breakfast buffet .
These same women are the target of a female-oriented media push , anchored by a running NRA web series called “ Armed and Fabulous. ” An early episode looks admiringly at the Potterfield women of the Midway ammunition empire , whose scion , Larry , is one of the NRA 's biggest industry donors .
The women-and-guns motif carried over into the male-dominated dog-and-pony show known as the Leadership Forum , where 2016 hopefuls bragged about their wives ' gun racks . Rick Santorum boasted that his wife owns more guns than he does , and that his five-year old daughter is already an NRA member . Indiana Governor Mike Pence talked about falling in love with his wife for her handgun . Florida Senator Marco Rubio bemoaned the paperwork required for his female staffers to carry and conceal . And after two years in which Glenn Beck delivered the keynote , this year 's honor fell to the pistol-packin ' Mama Grizzly , Sarah Palin .
What 's going on ? The modern NRA is , above all , a thinly veiled industry group . Its “ mom ” offensive reflects basic gun industry economics : manufacturers ' continued growth depends in no small part on making up for the duck and deer hunting demographic , which has been static or declining for generations .
The industry hopes that women can be their growth market . Thus far its degree of success is anyone 's guess . Anecdotal evidence and some polling shows an increase in female gun ownership in recent years . But according to the General Social Survey , the gold standard for survey research , only 12 percent of women owned guns in 2012 , a lower level than in the mid-1990s .
Whether or not there 's a real demographic sea change at hand , the transformation is unfolding in the gun media , both popular and trade , where designers and analysts discuss the need for new models representing the past and future of the industry . Gun makers are rolling out more rifles fitted for arthritic fingers , as well as handguns like the Pavona pistol , “ designed for the discerning woman . ”
There is also a political dimension . Following the Sandy Hook massacre , Shannon Watts opened a new front in the gun debate by founding Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America , which now claims 130,000 moms as members and chapters in all 50 states . The group 's calls for common-sense gun-reform sparked new life in a grassroots gun-reform movement that needed a boost . Last year Watts ' group merged with Bloomberg 's Mayors Against Illegal Guns , giving it money to go with its grassroots muscle . Watts ' success created a frame that put the gun lobby on the wrong side of the gender divide .
The result was the image makeover rolled out in Indianapolis . A couple of years ago , in St. Louis , the group unveiled a testosterone-heavy election 2012 media campaign centered around Chuck Norris and R. Lee “ Gunny ” Ermey , best known as the donut-hating drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket . Last weekend , the NRA unveiled a modern look : slick ads that prominently featured women and people of color .
After drawing criticism in the wake of Sandy Hook for the paranoid ranting of white male spokespeople like LaPierre , the NRA has spent the last 18 months building a diverse bench . It now employs seven commentators for its NRA News media wing , including three women ( Natalie Foster , Gabby Franco , and Nikki Turpeaux ) , an African American ( Colion Noir ) , and Chris Cheng , an Asian-American who has declared himself `` gay for guns . ''
Meanwhile , young women like CNN 's S.E . Cupp , The Blaze 's Dana Loesch , and Fox News ' Katie Pavlich regularly appear on cable news to provide the NRA 's line on the gun issue .
The NRA mom meme is n't just a top-down thing coming from Fairfax . While strolling the gun show floor -- a 40,000 square-foot maze of merchants exhibiting everything from gun insurance to fully automatic , sub-compact `` greasers '' -- I ran into Kyle Coplen , the affable young CEO of the Armed Citizen Project , a non-profit that offers free shotguns and training to residents of high-crime neighborhoods . He was handing out his own mom-themed schwag , and said he 'd been doing it for months . The shirts he designed show a female silhouette holding a child 's hand with one arm , a shotgun with the other . With a nod to shirts found in the tourist shops of South Beach and the French Quarter , it reads : “ I support single moms . ”
Coplen explained that he 's currently arming all kinds of moms . “ We 've trained and armed women in wheelchairs and women with special needs children , ” he said . So far , his donated shotguns have all been traditional steel and wood , but he 'd have no problem handing out guns in the increasingly popular hot pink . “ The idea of banning pink guns is part of the liberal anti-gunners 'war on women ' , ” he said .
I 'd heard the same thing earlier that morning in a park opposite the convention center . There , a coalition of new pro-gun mom groups took advantage of perfect spring weather and rallied under the slogan , “ Armed Moms United to Protect. ” Suburban and middle-class , they were textbook Glocker Moms . There were n't many of them , but they all seemed to have their own mom group .
Whether these groups were letterhead organizations or represented a genuine phenomenon among the brassroots is hard to say . But they do seem serious . Most have registered as 501 ( c ) 3 's and some are also functioning as PACs . The groups sponsoring the Saturday rally included Moms With Guns Demand Action , Indiana Moms Against Gun Control , and 1 Million Moms Against Gun Control . Some of them had mom-guns in their mom-jeans .
I asked one of them , Linda Elliot of 1 Million Moms Against Gun Control , how many mom groups like hers had sprung up . “ Too many to count probably , ” she said . “ The rhetorical terrain is shifting toward women , so our message is that it 's okay to be a mom and own guns . I hate to give Shannon Watts any credit , but when she threw such a tempter tantrum , it kind of exploded . ”
The Glocker Moms ' message may be tailored for women , but they are going to have trouble with that broad political hinge group once famous as Soccer Moms . As I approached their rally , the gun lobbyist and hard-right operator Larry Pratt , who runs the NRA rival Gun Owners of America , was praising Cliven Bundy as an American hero ( this was after Bundy 's comments on the state of “ the Negro ” ) .
Pratt , who has consorted with neo-Nazis and other extremists over the years , may be the scariest mother of them all . If Linda Elliot wants to cultivate non-rural female gun ownership and activism , her group might want to stop associating with people with long records of conspiratorial and racist commentary .
Pratt is a minor obstacle if the goal is bringing more women to the gun movement . The NRA 's board of directors tolerates a culture shot through with misogyny . Earlier this year , Nugent became the subject of a firestorm of controversy after he was invited to campaign with the GOP 's candidate for governor of Texas and state Democrats responded by highlighting his inflammatory commentary on women .
Later that afternoon , back at the gun show , I asked Jan Morgan of Armed American Women about this tension . Morgan had keynoted the “ Armed Moms ” rally with a speech that blended gun-policy with attacks on liberals and abortion rights , delivered while wearing a pistol prominently strapped around her calf . She said pro-gun women should make their case in the context of protecting life , and that means tying it to anti-abortion politics . “ Look , if anti-gun liberals are going to talk about banning guns to protect children , then they need to look at abortion , ” she said .
Whether most women agree with her on abortion or not , she said there was no stopping the surge in women buying guns . “ Women [ gun owners ] are the largest growing group because of the level of crime , the number of mass shootings , ” she said . “ They understand the best way to protect yourself and your children is with a gun . They 're gon na have a huge impact on the movement . Shannon Watts and Bloomberg are going to regret opening up the language of 'moms ' . ”
Shannon Watts , the original Gun Debate Mom and an Indianapolis native , was in town for the weekend . On Saturday , she led a 300-mom strong “ stroller jam ” in protest a few blocks north of the convention center . On Sunday , she unveiled a Mothers Dream Quilt and released a new report , `` Not Your Grandparents ' NRA . '' The latter was written under the imprimatur of her new group , Everytown for Gun Safety .
Watts ' report focused on the NRA 's growing political radicalism , but the gender shift is leaving pink streaks that are also unlike anything in the group 's history . Few were the exhibits on the gun show floor that did not feature products catering to women . We are now well past the novelty of a pink AR-15 here , a sparkled pistol there . Today 's woman has holsters and targets of her own . In Indy , the Law Enforcement Targets booth had already sold out of its bestselling pink shooting target , sales of which benefit not the NRA 's “ round-up ” program , but breast cancer research and awareness . “ Our new line of female targets is selling like crazy , ” said a company rep. Down the aisle , the first company to market exclusively to the woman shooter , the Ontario-based Packing In Pink , likewise did a brisk trade .
“ Industry is finally catching up with us , ” said Linda Elliot of 1 Million Moms . “ A few years ago it was hard to find a holster or gun that fit a woman 's hand . ”
As the convention was winding down on Sunday afternoon , I chatted with Alan Gottlieb , the man who anticipated all of this . Gottlieb was sitting unassumingly in his trademark bowtie , signing up new members for his gun-rights group , the Second Amendment Foundation . Most NRA members have never heard of Gottlieb , but he is among the most important figures in the development of the modern gun-rights movement . His group , not the NRA , built the legal team and the strategy behind the landmark Supreme Court gun cases of McDonald and Heller , not to mention dozens of important state-level suits . Among the literature arrayed before him was the current issue of a magazine called Women and Guns , which he has been publishing since 1989 . A long-term strategist , Gottlieb dismissed the “ mom ” boom as a silly marketing arms race and a distraction from larger trends .
“ It 's not just about 'moms , ' ” said Gottlieb . “ The future is about all of the non-traditional groups : single women , the LGBT community , people living in cities , Hispanics who come to this country to enjoy our freedoms , including Second Amendment rights . Those are the only places we can grow . That 's where you find the future of the gun-rights movement . ”
As he began packing up his materials , I asked Gottlieb if the rapid adoption of maternal messaging -- by the NRA , by the Glocker Moms , by industry -- might not betray a fear , or at least a nervousness , that suburban women and mothers , if unchallenged , could swing the political momentum toward serious gun reform .
“ Fear ? Look around , ” he said , gesturing at the bustling arms bazaar extending in every direction .
“ No , I really do n't think these guys are too worried about their future . ”","INDIANAPOLIS-- The theme of last week's National Rifle Association annual meeting was an odd one: maternity.

This latest shooting at a school campus has apparently been the straw that broke the camel ’ s back as he reportedly prepares to issue executive orders to expand background checks for gun buyers .
President Obama is openly politicizing the issue as he feels that the public may be near a tipping point and his own time in office is slipping by without any progress on this issue . Though I vehemently disagree with his solution and have no idea how it ’ s constitutionally allowable , he at least has one .
General manager Steve Alcairo holds a Winchester 1200 shotgun while being interviewed at High Bridge Arms Inc. in San Francisco , Wednesday , Dec. 19 , 2012 . ( AP/Jeff Chiu )
So far , the Republican response has mainly been defending against the onslaught of progressives who want more gun control and a reduction of guns in the country . Defense . Again .
It is maddening to watch them bumble and stumble around with no real response to the seemingly growing number of mass shootings in schools except to try and absorb the blows from the gun control advocates and hope that the wave of emotions passes without any real damage .
Enough is enough . The Republicans need an actual plan to reduce these shootings and need to take the offensive rather than being backed into a corner and hit with body shots again and again .
First up is the low hanging fruit . Federal minimum sentences for gun crimes already exist when someone is convicted of a federal felony involving violence or drug trafficking . Wonderful . This broad-brush approach , however , lumps in people who have legally purchased a gun and those who have acquired it through other means ( read : illegally ) .
This should be changed so that the minimum sentences are reduced if the gun is legally owned , but maintained or even increased if it was illegally acquired . This separates legal gun ownership from illegal ownership , a much needed differentiation in a time where the two often get lumped together .
Second , a modification to the HIPAA laws could be greatly beneficial to prevent people with severe mental illnesses from purchasing a gun . Currently , there are many states who provide almost no records for individuals who would be prohibited from buying a gun based on mental health reasons . Why ? The Privacy Rule in HIPAA .
The Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect medical records and the personal health information of patients . The cases in which those records and information is allowed to be shared can be very vague when it comes to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) used to vet a potential gun buyer .

This latest shooting at a school campus has apparently been the straw that broke the camel’s back as he reportedly prepares to issue executive orders to expand background checks for gun buyers.

President Obama is openly politicizing the issue as he feels that the public may be near a tipping point and his own time in office is slipping by without any progress on this issue. Though I vehemently disagree with his solution and have no idea how it’s constitutionally allowable, he at least has one.

The Republicans? Not so much.

So far, the Republican response has mainly been defending against the onslaught of progressives who want more gun control and a reduction of guns in the country. Defense. Again.

It is maddening to watch them bumble and stumble around with no real response to the seemingly growing number of mass shootings in schools except to try and absorb the blows from the gun control advocates and hope that the wave of emotions passes without any real damage.

Enough is enough. The Republicans need an actual plan to reduce these shootings and need to take the offensive rather than being backed into a corner and hit with body shots again and again.

Here is that plan:

Minimum Sentences For Illegal Ownership

First up is the low hanging fruit. Federal minimum sentences for gun crimes already exist when someone is convicted of a federal felony involving violence or drug trafficking. Wonderful. This broad-brush approach, however, lumps in people who have legally purchased a gun and those who have acquired it through other means (read: illegally).

This should be changed so that the minimum sentences are reduced if the gun is legally owned, but maintained or even increased if it was illegally acquired. This separates legal gun ownership from illegal ownership, a much needed differentiation in a time where the two often get lumped together.

Mental Health Concerns

Second, a modification to the HIPAA laws could be greatly beneficial to prevent people with severe mental illnesses from purchasing a gun. Currently, there are many states who provide almost no records for individuals who would be prohibited from buying a gun based on mental health reasons. Why? The Privacy Rule in HIPAA.

The Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect medical records and the personal health information of patients. The cases in which those records and information is allowed to be shared can be very vague when it comes to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) used to vet a potential gun buyer.

Within this rule, there is no explicit permission to share information with the NICS database. This should be corrected so that those who are already legally prohibited from buying a gun are actually stopped should they try to do so. Adding this explicit permission removes any legal questions and gray areas that would have previously prevented states from sharing the pertinent data.

Protection In Schools

Third, any publicly funded school should install metal detectors at all entrances. I do not believe in forcing every school to comply with this and so I believe it should be an “opt in” plan. Local school boards will have to make the decision in the end, but this gives the parents, students and employees of the district a very real voice in what that decision is.

I do, however, believe a funding mechanism should be in place. Currently we give out $2.8 billion in “Democracy, Human Rights and Governance” aid to countries around the world. This is just a small piece of the nearly $34 billion in foreign aid that is planned to be spent. Surely this would be enough to fund any district who chose to secure their schools with metal detectors.

The other piece to this is that each school will be required to have one frequently trained and tested employee that is armed at all times per 500 students. They will be trained and tested on a regular basis by local police, given a tax free stipend equal to 5 percent of the average teacher salary for the district, any medical bills incurred while performing their duty will be fully covered and they will have a life insurance policy equal to double their current salary if they are killed while performing their duty.

This, I believe, provides enough incentive for people to volunteer, but not enough that the wrong people step up for the wrong reasons. With about 50.1 million public school students in the country, this equates to just over 100,000 armed volunteers. If that 5 percent stipend averages out to $3,500 per year, it would cost our country just over $350 million. The medical bills and life insurance policies would be negligible due to the fact that shootings are still a rare occurrence at schools. With the above $2.8 billion in play, this would easily be funded.

Gun-Free Zones

Last but not least, gun free zones would be outlawed. The Second Amendment states that the “right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Unlike the First Amendment, which explicitly applies restrictions to Congress, the Second Amendment simply states that this right shall not be infringed. Period. That means that neither Congress nor any private citizen or business can infringe upon that right.

Based on this, gun free zones would be unconstitutional as they infringe upon an individual’s right to bear arms. Whatever the rationale behind the preference, a business or institution is not allowed to violate someone’s constitutionally protected rights.

Gun free zones? Bye bye.

To anyone who would gasp at forcing a business to allow guns in their store in violation of their conscience or preferences, I give you four simple words: Sweet Cakes by Melissa.

These four ideas, particularly the last two, address the issue of mass shootings without conceding the false argument that guns are the issue and they need to be regulated even more. None of these ideas expand background checks or create any more restrictions on gun ownership. Rather, they seek to add some real common sense to a difficult issue, help protect those in vulnerable settings and respect the right of the Second Amendment.

All that is needed is to find a Republican courageous enough to stick to their guns, advance a set of proposals like this and not back down. It’s time to stop allowing ourselves to be painted into a defensive corner and to take back the narrative on guns from those who use it to control us.

For decades , the federal government , with the support of the National Rifle Association , has made it very difficult to answer a question at the heart of American public health and safety : Does gun control work ?
The answer is hugely important given that guns killed nearly 39,000 Americans in 2016 alone . But after research on gun violence in the 1990s found that firearms do not — contrary to NRA talking points — make people safer , the group backed a federal funding freeze on gun policy research .
But studies have gone on — just without federal funding . And on Friday , a nonpartisan think tank , the RAND Corporation , released the results so far of its Gun Policy in America initiative , a two-year dive into the research on gun violence and the laws trying to curtail it .
RAND ’ s extensive report does not make any sweeping declarations about gun policy . It does , however , make clear that gun control research is very limited , calling on Congress to lift the NRA-backed funding freeze . It argues that this freeze has , by making it difficult to conduct better studies , led to a confusing empirical environment , where it ’ s easy for groups on both sides of the debate to cite shoddy work that supports their prior beliefs .
“ The studies that have been done often reach opposite conclusions to each other , ” Andrew Morral , the head of RAND ’ s gun policy initiative , told me . The lack of thorough research , he added , “ creates this kind of fact-free environment in which people can cherry-pick any study that happens to support what their priors are on the effects of the law . ”
Morral ’ s team spent two years reviewing US-based studies published over the past several decades , pulling out the most rigorous to try to find some “ incontrovertible truths. ” RAND concluded that , first and foremost , far more research is necessary . “ Many of the matters that people disagree on when they disagree on gun policy have not been rigorously studied in ways that produce reasonably unambiguous results , ” Morral said .
But there were some things that could be gleaned from the available evidence . While RAND as a nonpartisan group avoided any sweeping policy conclusions in its analysis , its review does seem to point in a direction , based on my own reading : More permissive gun policies lead to more gun deaths , while more restrictive policies lead to fewer gun deaths . Coupled with other evidence in this area , that supports the idea that more guns lead to more gun deaths .
Given that America is dealing with an immediate gun violence problem , as mass shootings and deaths pile up , the report is worth taking seriously . At the very least , there ’ s enough evidence to suggest that the federal government should stop refusing to fund research on policies that really could work to save thousands of lives every year .
RAND ’ s report does not come out in favor of more or less gun control . Instead , the team compiled the best research that ’ s available so far into charts and in-depth evaluations — the result of a review of dozens of studies , focused on 13 policies and eight outcomes . Here are the overall findings , which only included studies that met RAND ’ s rigorous standards :
The RAND report emphasizes that much of the research on gun policy is still in its infancy . You can see that in the chart above in all the white and gray space — we still don ’ t have answers to a lot of important questions when it comes to gun policy , including the effects on defensive gun use , hunting and recreation , and police shootings .
But the answers we do have point in one direction . On the gun control front , there ’ s moderate evidence that background checks reduce suicide and violent crime , limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness reduce suicide , moderate evidence that those prohibitions reduce violent crime , and supportive evidence that child-access prevention laws reduce suicides and unintentional injuries and deaths .
Meanwhile , there ’ s limited evidence that concealed carry laws increase violent crime and unintentional injuries and deaths . And there ’ s moderate evidence that “ stand your ground ” laws — NRA-backed measures that expand when someone can use a gun or other weapons to defend himself — increase violent crime .
If you put this all together , it suggests that restrictive laws seem to lead to fewer gun deaths , while the permissive laws seem to lead to more gun deaths .
That ’ s not enough for nonpartisan researchers at RAND to make sweeping conclusions , but it ’ s certainly suggestive — particularly for policymakers interested in finding solutions to America ’ s gun violence problem as soon as possible .
“ I don ’ t want to claim a general truth from this yet , ” Morral said . “ There ’ s been so little research that we ’ re really at the mercy of a few studies . If we could fill every cell in the empty table that we put up , I don ’ t know if we would see the same thing . But it ’ s possible . ”
It ’ s worth pointing out here that RAND ’ s standards are fairly high . For example , it deemed an oft-cited study from Missouri “ inconclusive. ” That study found that when Missouri repealed its handgun licensing law in 2007 , firearm homicides — but not other types of homicides — rose significantly . That certainly suggests that the law led to an immediate increase in homicides .
But RAND ’ s team was more cautious . For one , Missouri also passed its “ stand your ground ” law in 2007 . Could that explain the rise in homicides , given the evidence that “ stand your ground ” laws increase violent crime ? RAND ’ s team wasn ’ t convinced that the Missouri study completely ruled that out , given some of its methodological limitations .
RAND also excluded foreign studies in its official synthesis ( although it did include a few foreign studies in brief essays ) . Some of these studies have compelling evidence for gun restrictions , but RAND ’ s team argued that the US is too unusual for those other findings to cleanly apply .
Another major area of limitation was the way the science itself was done . Studies try to find what ’ s known as statistical significance — a mathematical test that helps researchers understand if the effect they found is real or the result of a statistical anomaly . In some cases , this can make it difficult to detect small effects in a scientifically reliable manner .
But in gun policy , a small effect could actually be huge , RAND noted : “ For example , a 3-percent reduction in firearm deaths corresponds to 1,000 fewer deaths per year nationally . ”
This problem could be overcome with better , more rigorous research . But because the studies were often dealing with limited data and methodologies , many of them couldn ’ t work through these problems .
Overall , the research that RAND included in its analysis — and deemed reliable — just did not answer many questions to the team ’ s satisfaction , even if the evidence appears suggestive to you or me .
That ’ s not to say RAND itself made no conclusions . The think tank found supportive evidence for child access prevention laws reducing suicide and unintentional injuries and deaths . And Morral agreed that the evidence is stronger on background checks and prohibitions associated with mental illness than other gun policies .
But Morral and RAND weren ’ t comfortable reaching the conclusions that I ’ ve made after seeing their findings .
Unsatisfied with the state of the research , RAND tried to find other sources for answers . So it turned to gun policy experts .
“ Given that there ’ s a fair amount that ’ s not been studied but matters in these gun policy debates , we believed that policymakers and the public tend to turn to experts — researchers , but also policy analysts at advocacy organizations , ” Morral said . “ And so we wanted to understand , in the absence of a real consensus around lots of the potential effects of these policies , what do the experts from these two different sides believe those effects are ? ”
RAND surveyed experts about 15 policies , splitting them into two camps : those who support more restrictive gun policies , and those who support more permissive policies . The full results are available over at RAND ’ s website , which compiled them into interactive maps .
There ’ s some obvious disagreement here . Those in the more restrictive camp said that restrictive policies would reduce homicides and more permissive measures would have the opposite effect . Those on the more permissive side said that restrictive policies would have little to no effect , while permissive policies would reduce homicides .
And if you implemented all 15 policies included in the survey , both sides said that gun homicides would fall .
One caveat to the survey results : “ These are really back-of-the-envelope calculations , ” Morral said . So the exact percentages in the maps should not be taken too literally , but the general trends do at least give some guidance for where experts land on these issues .
There were some big points of agreement : Both sides agreed on the effects of forcing prohibited possessors to give up firearms , expanded mental health prohibitions , and a child access prevention media campaign , concluding that such measures would reduce gun deaths overall .
Another point of agreement : gun suicides , which killed 59 percent more people in the US than gun homicides in 2016 . Both sides said , on average , that more restrictive gun policies would reduce firearm suicides — saving at least thousands of lives annually .
The survey also exposed why the different sides disagree on these issues . According to RAND , it ’ s not that both sides have totally different values — that the permissive side , for example , believes that gun rights are important even if they increase firearm homicides .
Instead , both sides generally agree that the top concerns are public health and safety outcomes . It ’ s just that they disagree on which policies are more effective at doing that — the permissive side genuinely believes that more permissive gun policies could save lives , while the more restrictive side genuinely believes that more restrictive policies could save lives .
One reason for the difference may be conflicting beliefs about what RAND characterized as a substitution effect . The report explained :
The median respondent with more-permissive regulatory preferences indicated that if a policy successfully reduced a state ’ s firearm suicides , 90 percent of the prevented suicides would still end as a suicide by some other means . In contrast , the median respondent with more-restrictive regulatory preferences responded that 20 percent would still end as a suicide . They produced the same stark differences in expected substitution of means for firearm homicides : 90 percent for those favoring permissive policies , and 20 percent for those favoring restrictive policies . Those who favor permissive policies view reductions of firearm suicides and homicides as largely futile efforts because these outcomes will continue , largely uninhibited , through other means .
There is some evidence for the more restrictive side here . Consider suicide : It tends to be fairly impulsive , with people often deciding to kill themselves and acting on it within hours . But if they don ’ t have a gun around , maybe they ’ ll give up on it altogether . Or if they reach for other means , those are simply going to be much less deadly than a firearm — while the death rate of suicide attempts with guns is above 90 percent , the death rate with other means can drop to below 10 percent .
Regardless , disagreement over the substitution effect helps explain why smart people on both sides can have such different views on gun policy .
Outside of RAND ’ s research , there has been a lot of evidence that there is a correlation between the availability of guns and more gun deaths .
The research , compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health ’ s Injury Control Research Center , is pretty clear : After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime , places with more guns have more gun deaths .
“ Within the United States , a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide , ” David Hemenway , the Injury Control Research Center ’ s director , wrote in Private Guns , Public Health .
For example , a 2013 study , led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher , found that , after controlling for multiple variables , each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate .
This chart , based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury , shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) among wealthier nations , demonstrating that the US in particular has way more guns and gun deaths than its developed peers :
There ’ s good reason to believe , too , that guns are to blame here . As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley ’ s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found , it ’ s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries . This chart , based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University , shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime :
Instead , the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that ’ s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns .
” A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar , ” Zimring and Hawkins wrote . “ A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London . ”
This is in many ways intuitive : People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends , family , and peers . But in the US , it ’ s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone .
RAND takes a more skeptical view . The report argued that it can be hard to disentangle the relationship between more guns and more gun deaths : Is it the abundance of guns leading to more gun deaths , or are people seeing a lot of violence in their communities and reacting to it by stocking up on guns to protect themselves ? RAND concluded that there ’ s just not enough in the research it reviewed to solve this chicken-or-egg scenario .
Still , when RAND ’ s findings are coupled with other studies we have , there ’ s some suggestive evidence that easy access to guns is the cause here .
Take the research on gun control measures more broadly , including the foreign studies that RAND left out . A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries published in Epidemiologic Reviews , for example , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence . That ’ s a very strong indicator that it ’ s the guns that are causing the deaths , since restrictions on guns were followed by a drop in violence . And it comes from very big , reliable meta-analysis .
But as RAND points out , things are less clear when trying to gauge how well specific policies would work in more exact terms , particularly in a US context .
America has a ton of guns — by far more than any other country in the world ; it ’ s an open question how you go about reducing or restricting a stockpile so large .
Would people react violently to a mandatory buyback program similar to the one Australia used to confiscate guns ? Would a universal background check system have a big impact , given that people could potentially get around it in the underground markets by simply trading the many firearms already in circulation ? If America required licensing and registration for guns , how would it ensure that people who already own weapons get the proper license and registration filed ?
The research — including some of RAND ’ s findings — suggests that these three policies would likely reduce gun deaths to some extent . The question is just how big the effect would be and which policies would be the most effective — a very important question if the US is ever going to bring gun violence down to European levels .
All of that is to say that more research is needed . That ’ s why it ’ s so bad that the federal government , typically a major facilitator of studies , has for decades refused to fund the research .
Stateline staff writer Michael Ollove , citing a recent study in JAMA , summarized the problem : “ The study said that gun violence research received a paltry 1.6 percent of the [ federal ] funding ( $ 22 million ) that would be predicted ( $ 1.4 billion ) based on the number of deaths caused by guns — 36,252 in 2015 , according to the CDC . ”
In the absence of the federal government , RAND is stepping in to try to help out researchers . It put up a database of gun laws , which it hopes will help researchers conduct more accurate analyses of the effects of such laws . It also put out a lengthy , wonky set of recommendations for improving the methodology of research into this area . ( Be warned : Unless you ’ re a statistician or pretty familiar with statistics , much of it will go over your head . )
This all goes to addressing one of the key problems with the lack of federal funding : Since it can be difficult to get money for gun research , it ’ s hard to build up correct data sets and thorough methodologies when conducting studies . After all , these are things that are not only time-consuming but financially costly as well — it ’ s not cheap to run big surveys across the country .
“ We have not been collecting some of the right data to do these analyses well , ” Morral said . So researchers often rely on limited data just because it ’ s what ’ s available .
As an example : Several studies looking at the effects of concealed carry permits looked at firearm homicides in general . But what a researcher should ideally want to look at in this area is the effect of firearm homicides outside the home , since that ’ s where people really use those permits . The data , however , often can ’ t be broken up like that .
Federal funding could go to surveys and on-the-ground research that could help address the gaps .
The funding is something , however , that pro-gun groups like the NRA have worked against for years . And so far , their tactics have worked — keeping the federal freeze in place . So although there ’ s evidence that some gun control measures could work , we by and large remain blind to what specific solutions would work best and what all of their effects would be .","Share All sharing options for: A new, huge review of gun research has bad news for the NRA

For decades, the federal government, with the support of the National Rifle Association, has made it very difficult to answer a question at the heart of American public health and safety: Does gun control work?

The answer is hugely important given that guns killed nearly 39,000 Americans in 2016 alone. But after research on gun violence in the 1990s found that firearms do not — contrary to NRA talking points — make people safer, the group backed a federal funding freeze on gun policy research.

But studies have gone on — just without federal funding. And on Friday, a nonpartisan think tank, the RAND Corporation, released the results so far of its Gun Policy in America initiative, a two-year dive into the research on gun violence and the laws trying to curtail it.

RAND’s extensive report does not make any sweeping declarations about gun policy. It does, however, make clear that gun control research is very limited, calling on Congress to lift the NRA-backed funding freeze. It argues that this freeze has, by making it difficult to conduct better studies, led to a confusing empirical environment, where it’s easy for groups on both sides of the debate to cite shoddy work that supports their prior beliefs.

“The studies that have been done often reach opposite conclusions to each other,” Andrew Morral, the head of RAND’s gun policy initiative, told me. The lack of thorough research, he added, “creates this kind of fact-free environment in which people can cherry-pick any study that happens to support what their priors are on the effects of the law.”

Morral’s team spent two years reviewing US-based studies published over the past several decades, pulling out the most rigorous to try to find some “incontrovertible truths.” RAND concluded that, first and foremost, far more research is necessary. “Many of the matters that people disagree on when they disagree on gun policy have not been rigorously studied in ways that produce reasonably unambiguous results,” Morral said.

But there were some things that could be gleaned from the available evidence. While RAND as a nonpartisan group avoided any sweeping policy conclusions in its analysis, its review does seem to point in a direction, based on my own reading: More permissive gun policies lead to more gun deaths, while more restrictive policies lead to fewer gun deaths. Coupled with other evidence in this area, that supports the idea that more guns lead to more gun deaths.

Given that America is dealing with an immediate gun violence problem, as mass shootings and deaths pile up, the report is worth taking seriously. At the very least, there’s enough evidence to suggest that the federal government should stop refusing to fund research on policies that really could work to save thousands of lives every year.

The available research points in one direction

RAND’s report does not come out in favor of more or less gun control. Instead, the team compiled the best research that’s available so far into charts and in-depth evaluations — the result of a review of dozens of studies, focused on 13 policies and eight outcomes. Here are the overall findings, which only included studies that met RAND’s rigorous standards:

The RAND report emphasizes that much of the research on gun policy is still in its infancy. You can see that in the chart above in all the white and gray space — we still don’t have answers to a lot of important questions when it comes to gun policy, including the effects on defensive gun use, hunting and recreation, and police shootings.

But the answers we do have point in one direction. On the gun control front, there’s moderate evidence that background checks reduce suicide and violent crime, limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness reduce suicide, moderate evidence that those prohibitions reduce violent crime, and supportive evidence that child-access prevention laws reduce suicides and unintentional injuries and deaths.

Meanwhile, there’s limited evidence that concealed carry laws increase violent crime and unintentional injuries and deaths. And there’s moderate evidence that “stand your ground” laws — NRA-backed measures that expand when someone can use a gun or other weapons to defend himself — increase violent crime.

If you put this all together, it suggests that restrictive laws seem to lead to fewer gun deaths, while the permissive laws seem to lead to more gun deaths.

That’s not enough for nonpartisan researchers at RAND to make sweeping conclusions, but it’s certainly suggestive — particularly for policymakers interested in finding solutions to America’s gun violence problem as soon as possible.

Still, the research is far from ideal.

“I don’t want to claim a general truth from this yet,” Morral said. “There’s been so little research that we’re really at the mercy of a few studies. If we could fill every cell in the empty table that we put up, I don’t know if we would see the same thing. But it’s possible.”

Could that explain the rise in homicides, given the evidence that “stand your ground” laws increase violent crime? RAND’s team wasn’t convinced that the Missouri study completely ruled that out, given some of its methodological limitations.

RAND also excluded foreign studies in its official synthesis (although it did include a few foreign studies in brief essays). Some of these studies have compelling evidence for gun restrictions, but RAND’s team argued that the US is too unusual for those other findings to cleanly apply.

And Morral agreed that the evidence is stronger on background checks and prohibitions associated with mental illness than other gun policies.

But Morral and RAND weren’t comfortable reaching the conclusions that I’ve made after seeing their findings.

Experts on both sides are split on key issues

Unsatisfied with the state of the research, RAND tried to find other sources for answers. So it turned to gun policy experts.

“Given that there’s a fair amount that’s not been studied but matters in these gun policy debates, we believed that policymakers and the public tend to turn to experts — researchers, but also policy analysts at advocacy organizations,” Morral said. “And so we wanted to understand, in the absence of a real consensus around lots of the potential effects of these policies, what do the experts from these two different sides believe those effects are?”

""You would no more charge or blame Ford or General Motors for drunk driving accidents,"" he explained.

Does this reform have traction?

Democrats in recent years, especially because mass shootings are now more prominently covered due to social media, have stepped up efforts to implement gun control. All of those efforts, which have come after two landmark Second Amendment cases within the last 11 years, have largely failed.

But taking aim at the firearm industry may prove fruitful. If Congress were to repeal the PLCAA, the firearm industry could be targeted with countless lawsuits, potentially inflicting hundreds of millions of dollars of economic strain on the industry. The move could essentially act as a backdoor to gun control.

Unfortunately for Second Amendment supporters, at least one liberal state is already helping shift the tides.

In March, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that gun maker Remington — which manufactured the AR-15 rifle used in the Sandy Hook massacre — can be sued for so-called wrongful marketing.",www.theblaze.com,right,JaqSBtPE0ETUKING

Rand Paul .
Mr. Paul , a strong gun rights advocate who formally announced his bid for the presidency this week , has not received any formal endorsements or money from the nation ’ s largest and most politically potent gun lobby despite his “ A ” voting record rating from the NRA .
“ We did not extend an invitation to Sen. Rand Paul , and he didn ’ t request to be invited , ” said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker , blaming the packed lineup and scheduling restraints for Mr. Paul ’ s absence . Mr. Paul and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie are two of the only top-tier GOP 2016 hopefuls not speaking at the NRA function .
Insiders , however , say it ’ s because of Mr. Paul ’ s association with the National Association for Gun Rights ( NAGR ) , a rival pro-gun rights umbrella group , that has angered other gun rights advocates , who accuse the group of misleading mailings and headline-stealing tactics .
NAGR was founded by Mike Rothfeld , a direct mail prodigy and owner of Virginia-based Saber Communications , to which Mr. Paul and his political action committees paid $ 2.6 million for services during the 2014 election cycle . The Kentucky senator ’ s father , Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , paid Saber about $ 7.7 million for work it did for his 2012 presidential campaign , according to Federal Election Commission filings .
Saber also handles the direct mail of NAGR and such other conservative groups as National Right to Work and National Pro-Life Alliance , maintaining all of their contact lists .
More recently , the younger Mr. Paul ’ s Reinventing a New Direction ( RAND ) political action committee paid Saber $ 7,400 last Dec. 23 to rent its mailing lists and contact names , according to FEC filings . Last election cycle , RAND PAC spent $ 216,452 to maintain access to Saber ’ s database .
“ I am a professional junk mailer , ” Mr. Rothfeld said at a lecture entitled “ The Real Nature of Politics , ” which was posted on YouTube two years ago . “ I am a professional telemarketer . I ’ m a professional spammer — like , a hundred million pieces of emails a month . And I ’ m a professional negative campaigner . And I ’ m damn proud of all four . ”
Mr. Rothfeld declined to discuss his business with The ███ , but NAGR officials portray the group as more conservative and effective than the NRA , which it claims is too connected to the official power structure in Washington .
All of Mr. Rothfeld ’ s mailings cast a wide net , reaching as many conservatives as possible , and critics say the company then aims to draw the recipient into the campaign by frightening them on issues or legislation that establishment figures don ’ t entertain as threats .
NAGR has branded itself as the conservative alternative to the NRA , one not beholden to Washington insiders . But some Second Amendment advocates think the group ’ s main claim to fame is stoking the fears of the less-informed for-profit .
Last month , the group ’ s affiliate in Mississippi , as labeled on NAGR ’ s website , sent a letter to pro-gun advocates urging them to donate money so they could help fight a state bill to mark ammunition . The only problem was there was no bill .
“ Just recently , the Mississippi Registration Ammo Bill ( S.B . 2030 ) was introduced , ” wrote Mississippi Gun Rights in a letter dated March 16 and obtained by The ███ . “ This is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to GUT our gun rights here in Mississippi ! ”
The bill NAGR ’ s letter was referring to — S.B . 2030 — was actually legislation dealing with the education reform program Common Core , and the ammunition bill the group was referencing ( S.B . 2219 ) had died in committee a month before the mailing was sent .
“ Sometimes there ’ s a legitimate need to sound the alarm bells when there ’ s actual danger on the horizon , ” said George Whitten Jr. , who received the letter from the group . “ But this was just deceiving — making up a danger and deceiving people on their mailing list so they would send more money to help defeat a bill that was already dead . ”
NAGR , run by Executive Vice President Dudley Brown with Mr. Rothfeld being named a director-at-large , was established in 2000 and claims to be the “ fastest growing gun-rights group in America ” on its website , serving as an umbrella group for a number of state-based gun rights groups .
The NAGR rose to fame when it outspent the NRA in terms of lobbying . However , the majority of its budget is spent on promotional materials .
According to the group ’ s most recent financial disclosures , in 2013 it raised $ 16.4 million . It spent $ 1.47 million on lobbying , but then paid out $ 5.97 million in direct mail ; $ 3.21 million in Internet promotion ; $ 334,694 in tour promotion ; and $ 344,629 in telemarketing expenses , altogether constituting 60 percent of its budget — its single largest expense .
“ In the year the NRA claimed to be the biggest watershed moment in gun control , 2013 , federal records showed we spent twice as much as they did lobbying , ” said Mr. Brown in an interview with The ███ . “ They kept their spending the same , but we went way over and above . ”
Mr. Brown said most of his mailers call for people to sign a petition or phone their representatives to protest a bill , but also include a way to donate to the organization if they wish , which drives up what they have to report in promotional spending .
As for the ammunition bill in Mississippi , he blamed it on a printing error .
He said his group was more aggressive and effective than the much larger NRA .
“ We ’ re younger , we ’ re hungrier , and we care less about the cocktail parties in Washington , D.C. , ” Mr. Brown recently told The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Paul ’ s image is used on NAGR ’ s fundraising materials , and the group consistently sends out both emails and letters credited to Mr. Paul on gun rights issues . Before the 2014 midterms the senator hosted a telemarketing call with about 6,000 NAGR supporters requesting $ 100 donations to help win political races , and in January he appeared at a NAGR-sponsored event in New Hampshire .
“ Senator Paul is happy to work with pro-2nd Amendment groups and will always make the issue a top priority , ” said Doug Stafford , the executive director of RAND PAC in an emailed statement to The ███ . “ Senator Paul signs letters for many groups promoting issues he believes in . He does not have any role in the strategy of those groups . ”
Mr. Stafford was asked if Mr. Paul was willing to distance himself from NAGR because of its reputation among other Second Amendment groups and he didn ’ t provide any substantive response .
Regarding the absence from the NRA conference slight , Mr. Stafford wrote : “ Sen . Paul is a champion of the Second Amendment and the strongest voice for freedom in the U.S. Senate . He has an unblemished record of support for gun rights . He is on the road announcing his run for president all week . ”
And , as political experts know , running for president is expensive and fundraising crucial .
“ Political campaigns are all startup companies ; they ’ ve got to build a base from the ground up , ” said Bruce Newman , a marketing professor at DePaul University and author of “ The Marketing of the President . ”
The aggregating of voter data through the multiple mailing lists of different organizations allows candidates to customize their message and microtarget certain people who have historically shown a propensity to get involved in issues they care about , either in an online setting or by going door-to-door — information that is extremely valuable to first-time presidential candidates for both turnout and fundraising , Mr. Newman said .
“ The aggregating of big data from multiple lists is extremely important in that it allows you to raise hundreds of millions of dollars by knowing who your audience is , how active in campaigns they ’ ve been , what they like to watch visually , words they respond to , what they like and how to inspire them , ” said Mr. Newman , noting President Obama ’ s election campaigns were the masters of big data and the aggregation of lists .
So far , Mr. Paul has been successful at motivating this grass-roots base , raising $ 1.2 million since announcing his presidency on Tuesday .
Still , some in the gun rights community don ’ t care for Mr. Paul extending his name and reputation to an organization like NAGR , which has been known to attack other Republicans and Second Amendment activists on grounds they consider specious .
“ Lots of people have complained to Rand that [ NAGR officials ] are raising money and doing nothing with it but attacking other Republicans and Second Amendment groups for not being ‘ pure enough , ’ ” said Alan Gottlieb , the founder of the Second Amendment Foundation , which filed and won a landmark suit overturning Chicago ’ s handgun ban and made it clear that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applied to states and localities .
Last year , the NAGR attacked Mr. Gottlieb for supporting a national gun registry .
Mr. Gottlieb said he never advocated for such a position . He did , however , support a Senate bill that expanded background checks some but prohibited any registry . According to Mr. Gottlieb , NAGR misconstrued the bill and his position on it and orchestrated attacks only to raise discontent and mistrust among gun rights supporters .
NAGR also likes to take credit for filing an amicus brief for the McDonald case that they neither had anything to do with nor coordinated with Mr. Gottlieb ’ s team , he said .
“ I wish Rand wouldn ’ t sign their letters , but they use Rand ’ s lists , and there ’ s a fundraising synergy between the two of them , and I guess Rand ’ s just not willing to let it go , ” Mr. Gottlieb said .","As more than a dozen possible 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls take the stage to address the National Rifle Association’s Leadership Forum on Friday, one name will notably be missing from the lineup: Sen.

A new CNN/Time/ORC poll shows majority support for stricter gun controls
The president signs 23 executive actions that do n't need congressional approval
President Obama calls for background checks on all gun sales
President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month .
With relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the Connecticut rampage looking on , Obama signed 23 executive actions -- which do n't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety .
He also called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds , and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention .
Referring to the young students killed in the Newtown shootings on December 14 and other victims of gun violence , Obama said the nation must do a better job of protecting its children , especially when they are in schools , shopping malls , movie theaters and other public places .

While some of the steps he proposed are given little chance of winning congressional approval in the face of the nation 's powerful gun lobby , Obama said all efforts must be made to reduce chronic gun violence in the country .
`` This is our first task as a society -- keeping our children safe , '' the president said , adding that saving even one life would make the changes he seeks worth the effort .
Republicans immediately rejected the Obama proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms .
`` Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook , '' said a statement by Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Florida , considered an up-and-coming GOP leader . `` President Obama is targeting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence . ''
The powerful National Rifle Association said it would work with Congress to find what it called `` real solutions to protecting America 's most valuable asset -- our children . ''
`` Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation , '' the NRA said in a statement . `` Only honest , law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy . ''
NRA President David Keene said the `` Second Amendment is going to survive '' Obama 's efforts on gun control .
`` What we want to see is what they really have in mind . They 've got bullet points . There 's going to be a lot more to it than that , '' Keene said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer . ''
Obama called accusations that he seeks to violate gun rights untrue , saying opponents want to wage a campaign of intimidation and fear instead of working with him for needed changes .
`` We can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale , '' he said .
Gun control supporters , including relatives of shooting victims , lauded Obama 's proposals as a good first step to reduce gun violence and urged legislators to take on the difficult issue instead of reverting to partisan postures .
`` When you are disheartened by the number of steps that have to be taken , by the fears of gun advocates , by the politics , please dig deep and find new heart , '' urged Emily Nottingham , the mother of Gabe Zimmerman , the legislative staffer killed in the 2010 Tuscon shooting that disabled Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona .
`` Think for a moment about your young staffers , your children or grandchildren , '' Nottingham continued . `` Now imagine that that cell phone in your pocket is vibrating and the message says they have been murdered by a stranger with an assault weapon . Imagine that , then shore up your resolve and keep working to protect your staffers , our children , our nation . We need you to not give up . ''
However , Jerry Henry of the Georgiacarry.org website , which opposes tighter gun controls , told CNN that the Obama proposals were misdirected .
`` He did absolutely nothing to address the criminal element , '' said Henry , who argued that studies show criminals get guns on the street instead of buying them from licensed gun shops that conduct background checks .
Fully enforcing existing gun laws and making criminals serve their full prison terms would do more to halt gun violence , according to Henry , who added that government `` can not legislate evil out of the minds of men . ''
Vice President Joe Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings , which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings . Biden 's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced Wednesday .
`` The world has changed , and it 's demanding action , '' Biden said at the White House event .
Opponents promise a political fight , with an NRA spokesman saying Tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an `` unprecedented '' spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month .
Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization 's existing 4.25 million members , according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam .
In addition , the NRA is receiving an influx of financial contributions , he said , adding : `` This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight . ''
A CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll Wednesday indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control , but they do n't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence .
According to the survey , 55 % of Americans generally favor stricter gun control laws , with 56 % saying that it 's currently too easy to buy guns in this country . However , only 39 % say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves .
Obama called for citizens to let their elected representatives know what they think , saying : `` The only way we can change is if the American people demand it . ''
He proposed legislative steps he previously has backed , such as reinstating the Clinton-era ban on assault weapons , and also requested that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety .
His executive actions signed Wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks .
A senior administration official told reporters the price tag for the entire package was $ 500 million .
Obama also said he would nominate B. Todd Jones , the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , to become its permanent chief . The agency has been without a full-time director for six years .

A new CNN/Time/ORC poll shows majority support for stricter gun controls

The president signs 23 executive actions that don't need congressional approval

President Obama calls for background checks on all gun sales

President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month.

With relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the Connecticut rampage looking on, Obama signed 23 executive actions -- which don't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety.

He also called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention.

Referring to the young students killed in the Newtown shootings on December 14 and other victims of gun violence, Obama said the nation must do a better job of protecting its children, especially when they are in schools, shopping malls, movie theaters and other public places.

While some of the steps he proposed are given little chance of winning congressional approval in the face of the nation's powerful gun lobby, Obama said all efforts must be made to reduce chronic gun violence in the country.

""This is our first task as a society -- keeping our children safe,"" the president said, adding that saving even one life would make the changes he seeks worth the effort.

Republicans immediately rejected the Obama proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms.

""Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,"" said a statement by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, considered an up-and-coming GOP leader. ""President Obama is targeting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence.""

The powerful National Rifle Association said it would work with Congress to find what it called ""real solutions to protecting America's most valuable asset -- our children.""

""Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,"" the NRA said in a statement. ""Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.""

Gun rights at center of debate

NRA President David Keene said the ""Second Amendment is going to survive"" Obama's efforts on gun control.

""What we want to see is what they really have in mind. They've got bullet points. There's going to be a lot more to it than that,"" Keene said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

Obama called accusations that he seeks to violate gun rights untrue, saying opponents want to wage a campaign of intimidation and fear instead of working with him for needed changes.

""We can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale,"" he said.

Gun control supporters, including relatives of shooting victims, lauded Obama's proposals as a good first step to reduce gun violence and urged legislators to take on the difficult issue instead of reverting to partisan postures.

""When you are disheartened by the number of steps that have to be taken, by the fears of gun advocates, by the politics, please dig deep and find new heart,"" urged Emily Nottingham, the mother of Gabe Zimmerman, the legislative staffer killed in the 2010 Tuscon shooting that disabled Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.

""Think for a moment about your young staffers, your children or grandchildren,"" Nottingham continued. ""Now imagine that that cell phone in your pocket is vibrating and the message says they have been murdered by a stranger with an assault weapon. Imagine that, then shore up your resolve and keep working to protect your staffers, our children, our nation. We need you to not give up.""

However, Jerry Henry of the Georgiacarry.org website, which opposes tighter gun controls, told CNN that the Obama proposals were misdirected.

""He did absolutely nothing to address the criminal element,"" said Henry, who argued that studies show criminals get guns on the street instead of buying them from licensed gun shops that conduct background checks.

Fully enforcing existing gun laws and making criminals serve their full prison terms would do more to halt gun violence, according to Henry, who added that government ""cannot legislate evil out of the minds of men.""

Polls capture public sentiment

Vice President Joe Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced Wednesday.

""The world has changed, and it's demanding action,"" Biden said at the White House event.

Opponents promise a political fight, with an NRA spokesman saying Tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an ""unprecedented"" spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month.

Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization's existing 4.25 million members, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

In addition, the NRA is receiving an influx of financial contributions, he said, adding: ""This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight.""

A CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll Wednesday indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence.

According to the survey, 55% of Americans generally favor stricter gun control laws, with 56% saying that it's currently too easy to buy guns in this country. However, only 39% say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves.

Obama called for citizens to let their elected representatives know what they think, saying: ""The only way we can change is if the American people demand it.""

He proposed legislative steps he previously has backed, such as reinstating the Clinton-era ban on assault weapons, and also requested that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety.

His executive actions signed Wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks.

A senior administration official told reporters the price tag for the entire package was $500 million.

Obama also said he would nominate B. Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to become its permanent chief. The agency has been without a full-time director for six years.

A main focus of Obama's steps was closing loopholes in background checks. While requiring universal background checks would require congressional approval, some of the executive actions signed by Obama were intended to bolster the existing system.

Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures.

That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales.

""If you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime, universal background checks is at the sweet spot,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, a leading backer of such screening.

Obama also called for more money to strengthen gun safety at schools, including hiring more counselors such as retired law enforcement officers to help educate students on gun issues. He also called for more funding for communities to hire more police officers, but stopped short of seeking the NRA's proposal for armed guards at every school.

The CNN/Time/ORC poll Wednesday showed that respondents favored armed guards in schools by 54%-45%.

Congressional hearings planned

Legislators said working with Congress will be paramount in curbing gun violence. California Rep. Mike Thompson told CNN on Tuesday that a ban on high-capacity magazines could garner Republican support, but a full-scale assault weapon ban would be hard to get passed in the GOP-controlled House.

House and Senate committees said they would start holding hearings on gun control measures in coming weeks.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations -- the nation's first since the Newtown shootings.

Both New York's GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins.

It includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state, altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard.

Residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10.

Keene derided outlawing high-capacity magazines as ""a bidding match"" that focuses on the wrong issue.

""So the president says you don't need 30-round magazines. How about a 10-round magazine? Andrew Cuomo says, 'Well, I can do better than that. I'll make it a seven-round magazine,'"" Keene said.

""The fact of the matter is the kinds of people who do this, particularly the mentally unbalanced -- who are the most likely people to do it -- shouldn't have any magazines,"" he said.

""The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described state's existing regulations as ""the toughest gun laws in the United States.""

Gallagher, Kim Parker, Kevin T. Maass","Gun Homicide Rate Down 49 % Since 1993 Peak ; Public Unaware
Note Some trends shown in this report have been updated . Rates for overall gun deaths , firearm homicides and firearm suicides have been updated through 2013 . The rate for non-fatal violent firearms victimizations has been updated through 2014 . Updated charts and information can be found here .
National rates of gun homicide and other violent gun crimes are strikingly lower now than during their peak in the mid-1990s , paralleling a general decline in violent crime , according to a ███ analysis of government data . Beneath the long-term trend , though , are big differences by decade : Violence plunged through the 1990s , but has declined less dramatically since 2000 .
Compared with 1993 , the peak of U.S. gun homicides , the firearm homicide rate was 49 % lower in 2010 , and there were fewer deaths , even though the nation ’ s population grew . The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults , robberies and sex crimes—was 75 % lower in 2011 than in 1993 . Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall ( with or without a firearm ) also is down markedly ( 72 % ) over two decades .
Nearly all the decline in the firearm homicide rate took place in the 1990s ; the downward trend stopped in 2001 and resumed slowly in 2007 . The victimization rate for other gun crimes plunged in the 1990s , then declined more slowly from 2000 to 2008 . The rate appears to be higher in 2011 compared with 2008 , but the increase is not statistically significant . Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall also dropped in the 1990s before declining more slowly from 2000 to 2010 , then ticked up in 2011 .
Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence , most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago . According to a new ███ survey , today 56 % of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 % think it is lower .
Looking back 50 years , the U.S. gun homicide rate began rising in the 1960s , surged in the 1970s , and hit peaks in 1980 and the early 1990s . ( The number of homicides peaked in the early 1990s . ) The plunge in homicides after that meant that firearm homicide rates in the late 2000s were equal to those not seen since the early 1960s . The sharp decline in the U.S. gun homicide rate , combined with a slower decrease in the gun suicide
rate , means that gun suicides now account for six-in-ten firearms deaths , the highest share since at least 1981 .
Trends for robberies followed a similar long-term trajectory as homicides ( National Research Council , 2004 ) , hitting a peak in the early 1990s before declining .
This report examines trends in firearm homicide , non-fatal violent gun crime victimization and non-fatal violent crime victimization overall since 1993 . Its findings on firearm crime are based mainly on analysis of data from two federal agencies . Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , using information from death certificates , are the source of rates , counts and trends for all firearm deaths , homicide and suicide , unless otherwise specified . The Department of Justice ’ s National Crime Victimization Survey , a household survey conducted by the Census Bureau , supplies annual estimates of non-fatal crime victimization , including those where firearms are used , regardless of whether the crimes were reported to police . Where relevant , this report also quotes from the FBI ’ s Uniform Crime Reports ( see text box at the end of this chapter and the Methodology appendix for more discussion about data sources ) .
Researchers have studied the decline in firearm crime and violent crime for many years , and though there are theories to explain the decline , there is no consensus among those who study the issue as to why it happened .
There also is debate about the extent of gun ownership in the U.S. , although no disagreement that the U.S. has more civilian firearms , both total and per capita , than other nations . Compared with other developed nations , the U.S. has a higher homicide rate and higher rates of gun ownership , but not higher rates for all other crimes . ( See Chapter 5 for more details . )
In the months since the mass shooting at a Newtown , Conn. , elementary school in December , the public is paying close attention to the topic of firearms ; according to a recent ███ survey ( ███ , April 2013 ) no story received more public attention from mid-March to early April than the debate over gun control . Reducing crime has moved up as a priority for the public in polling this year .
Mass shootings are a matter of great public interest and concern . They also are a relatively small share of shootings overall . According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics review , homicides that claimed at least three lives accounted for less than 1 % of all homicide deaths from 1980 to 2008 . These homicides , most of which are shootings , increased as a share of all homicides from 0.5 % in 1980 to 0.8 % in 2008 , according to the bureau ’ s data . A Congressional Research Service report , using a definition of four deaths or more , counted 547 deaths from mass shootings in the U.S. from 1983 to 2012 .
Looking at the larger topic of firearm deaths , there were 31,672 deaths from guns in the U.S. in 2010 . Most ( 19,392 ) were suicides ; the gun suicide rate has been higher than the gun homicide rate since at least 1981 , and the gap is wider than it was in 1981 .
Despite the attention to gun violence in recent months , most Americans are unaware that gun crime is markedly lower than it was two decades ago . A new ███ survey ( March 14-17 ) found that 56 % of Americans believe the number of crimes involving a gun is higher than it was 20 years ago ; only 12 % say it is lower and 26 % say it stayed the same . ( An additional 6 % did not know or did not answer . )
Men ( 46 % ) are less likely than women ( 65 % ) to say long-term gun crime is up . Young adults , ages 18 to 29 , are markedly less likely than other adults to say long-term crime is up—44 % do , compared with more than half of other adults . Minority adults are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to say that long-term gun crime is up , 62 % compared with 53 % .
Asked about trends in the number of gun crimes “ in recent years , ” a plurality of 45 % believe the number has gone up , 39 % say it is about the same and 10 % say it has gone down . ( An additional 5 % did not know or did not answer . ) As with long-term crime , women ( 57 % ) are more likely than men ( 32 % ) to say that gun crime has increased in recent years . So are non-white adults ( 54 % ) compared with whites ( 41 % ) . Adults ages 50 and older ( 51 % ) are more likely than those ages 18-49 ( 42 % ) to believe gun crime is up .
Researchers continue to debate the key factors behind changing crime rates , which is part of a larger discussion about the predictors of crime . There is consensus that demographics played some role : The outsized post-World War II baby boom , which produced a large number of people in the high-crime ages of 15 to 20 in the 1960s and 1970s , helped drive crime up in those years .
A review by the National Academy of Sciences of factors driving recent crime trends ( Blumstein and Rosenfeld , 2008 ) cited a decline in rates in the early 1980s as the young boomers got older , then a flare-up by mid-decade in conjunction with a rising street market for crack cocaine , especially in big cities . It noted recruitment of a younger cohort of drug seller with greater willingness to use guns . By the early 1990s , crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand , and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime .
At the same time , a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated , due in part to stricter laws , which helped restrain violence among this age group . It is less clear , researchers say , that innovative policing strategies and police crackdowns on use of guns by younger adults played a significant role in reducing crime .
Some researchers have proposed additional explanations as to why crime levels plunged so suddenly , including increased access to abortion and lessened exposure to lead . According to one hypothesis , legalization of abortion after the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision resulted in fewer unwanted births , and unwanted children have an increased risk of growing up to become criminals . Another theory links reduced crime to 1970s-era reductions in lead in gasoline ; children ’ s exposure to lead causes brain damage that could be associated with violent behavior . The National Academy of Sciences review said it was unlikely that either played a major role , but researchers continue to explore both factors .
The plateau in national violent crime rates has raised interest in the topic of how local differences might influence crime levels and trends . Crime reductions took place across the country in the 1990s , but since 2000 , patterns have varied more by metropolitan area or city .
One focus of interest is that gun ownership varies widely by region and locality . The National Academy of Sciences review of possible influences on crime trends said there is good evidence of a link between firearm ownership and firearm homicide at the local level ; “ the causal direction of this relationship remains in dispute , however , with some researchers maintaining that firearm violence elevates rates of gun ownership , but not the reverse . ”
There is substantial variation within and across regions and localities in a number of other realms , which complicates any attempt to find a single cause for national trends . Among the variations of interest to researchers are policing techniques , punishment policies , culture , economics and residential segregation .
Internationally , a decline in crime , especially property crime , has been documented in many countries since the mid-1990s . According to the authors of a 30-country study on criminal victimization ( Van Dijk et al. , 2007 ) , there is no general agreement on all the reasons for this decline . They say there is a general consensus that demographic change—specifically , the shrinking proportion of adolescents across Europe—is a common factor causing decreases across Western countries . They also cite wider use of security measures in homes and businesses as a factor in reducing property crime .
But other potential explanations—such as better policing or increased imprisonment—do not apply in Europe , where policies vary widely , the report noted
Among the major findings of this ███ report :
In 2010 , there were 3.6 gun homicides per 100,000 people , compared with 7.0 in 1993 , according to CDC data .
In 2010 , CDC data counted 11,078 gun homicide deaths , compared with 18,253 in 1993 .
Men and boys make up the vast majority ( 84 % in 2010 ) of gun homicide victims . The firearm homicide rate also is more than five times as high for males of all ages ( 6.2 deaths per 100,000 people ) as it is for females ( 1.1 deaths per 100,000 people ) .
By age group , 69 % of gun homicide victims in 2010 were ages 18 to 40 , an age range that was 31 % of the population that year . Gun homicide rates also are highest for adults ages 18 to 24 and 25 to 40 .
A disproportionate share of gun homicide victims are black ( 55 % in 2010 , compared with the 13 % black share of the population ) . Whites were 25 % of victims but 65 % of the population in 2010 . Hispanics were 17 % of victims and 16 % of the population in 2010 .
The firearm suicide rate ( 6.3 per 100,000 people ) is higher than the firearm homicide rate and has come down less sharply . The number of gun suicide deaths ( 19,392 in 2010 ) outnumbered gun homicides , as has been true since at least 1981 .
In 2011 , the NCVS estimated there were 181.5 gun crime victimizations for non-fatal violent crime ( aggravated assault , robbery and sex crimes ) per 100,000 Americans ages 12 and older , compared with 725.3 in 1993 .
In terms of numbers , the NCVS estimated there were about 1.5 million non-fatal gun crime victimizations in 1993 among U.S. residents ages 12 and older , compared with 467,000 in 2011 .
The victimization rate for all non-fatal violent crime among those ages 12 and older—simple and aggravated assaults , robberies and sex crimes , with or without firearms—dropped 53 % from 1993 to 2000 , and 49 % from 2000 to 2010 . It rose 17 % from 2010 to 2011 .
Although not the topic of this report , the rate of property crimes—burglary , motor vehicle theft and theft—also declined from 1993 to 2011 , by 61 % . The rate for these types of crimes was 351.8 per 100,000 people ages 12 and older in 1993 , 190.4 in 2000 and 138.7 in 2011 .
The number of firearms available for sale to or possessed by U.S. civilians ( about 310 million in 2009 , according to the Congressional Research Service ) has grown in recent years , and the 2009 per capita rate of one person per gun had roughly doubled since 1968 . It is not clear , though , how many U.S. households own guns or whether that share has changed over time .
Crime stories accounted for 17 % of the total time devoted to news on local television broadcasts in 2012 , compared with 29 % in 2005 , according to ███ ’ s Project for Excellence in Journalism . Crime trails only traffic and weather as the most common type of story on these newscasts .
About the Data Findings in this report are based on two main data sources : Data on homicides and other deaths are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , based on information from death certificates filed in state vital statistics offices , which includes causes of death reported by attending physicians , medical examiners and coroners . Data also include demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors , who obtain that information from family members and other informants . Population data , used in constructing rates , come from the Census Bureau . Most statistics were obtained via the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control ’ s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System ( WISQARS ) , available from URL : www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars . Data are available beginning in 1981 ; suitable population data do not exist for prior years . For more details , see Appendix 4 . Estimates of crime victimization are from the National Crime Victimization Survey , a sample survey conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statistics by the Census Bureau . Although the survey began in 1973 , this report uses data since 1993 , the first year employing an intensive methodological redesign . The survey collects information about crimes against people and households , but not businesses . It provides estimates of victimization for the population ages 12 and older living in households and non-institutional group quarters ; therefore it does not include populations such as homeless people , visiting foreign tourists and business travelers , or those living in institutions such as military barracks or mental hospitals . The survey collects information about the crimes of rape , sexual assault , personal robbery , aggravated and simple assault , household burglary , theft , and motor vehicle theft .

Pace of Decline Slows in Past Decade

Note Some trends shown in this report have been updated. Rates for overall gun deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides have been updated through 2013. The rate for non-fatal violent firearms victimizations has been updated through 2014. Updated charts and information can be found here.

Chapter 1: Overview

National rates of gun homicide and other violent gun crimes are strikingly lower now than during their peak in the mid-1990s, paralleling a general decline in violent crime, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Beneath the long-term trend, though, are big differences by decade: Violence plunged through the 1990s, but has declined less dramatically since 2000.

Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49% lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation’s population grew. The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall (with or without a firearm) also is down markedly (72%) over two decades.

Nearly all the decline in the firearm homicide rate took place in the 1990s; the downward trend stopped in 2001 and resumed slowly in 2007. The victimization rate for other gun crimes plunged in the 1990s, then declined more slowly from 2000 to 2008. The rate appears to be higher in 2011 compared with 2008, but the increase is not statistically significant. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall also dropped in the 1990s before declining more slowly from 2000 to 2010, then ticked up in 2011.

Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago. According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56% of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12% think it is lower.

Looking back 50 years, the U.S. gun homicide rate began rising in the 1960s, surged in the 1970s, and hit peaks in 1980 and the early 1990s. (The number of homicides peaked in the early 1990s.) The plunge in homicides after that meant that firearm homicide rates in the late 2000s were equal to those not seen since the early 1960s. The sharp decline in the U.S. gun homicide rate, combined with a slower decrease in the gun suicide

rate, means that gun suicides now account for six-in-ten firearms deaths, the highest share since at least 1981.

Trends for robberies followed a similar long-term trajectory as homicides (National Research Council, 2004), hitting a peak in the early 1990s before declining.

This report examines trends in firearm homicide, non-fatal violent gun crime victimization and non-fatal violent crime victimization overall since 1993. Its findings on firearm crime are based mainly on analysis of data from two federal agencies. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using information from death certificates, are the source of rates, counts and trends for all firearm deaths, homicide and suicide, unless otherwise specified. The Department of Justice’s National Crime Victimization Survey, a household survey conducted by the Census Bureau, supplies annual estimates of non-fatal crime victimization, including those where firearms are used, regardless of whether the crimes were reported to police. Where relevant, this report also quotes from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (see text box at the end of this chapter and the Methodology appendix for more discussion about data sources).

Researchers have studied the decline in firearm crime and violent crime for many years, and though there are theories to explain the decline, there is no consensus among those who study the issue as to why it happened.

There also is debate about the extent of gun ownership in the U.S., although no disagreement that the U.S. has more civilian firearms, both total and per capita, than other nations. Compared with other developed nations, the U.S. has a higher homicide rate and higher rates of gun ownership, but not higher rates for all other crimes. (See Chapter 5 for more details.)

In the months since the mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December, the public is paying close attention to the topic of firearms; according to a recent Pew Research Center survey (Pew Research Center, April 2013) no story received more public attention from mid-March to early April than the debate over gun control. Reducing crime has moved up as a priority for the public in polling this year.

Mass shootings are a matter of great public interest and concern. They also are a relatively small share of shootings overall. According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics review, homicides that claimed at least three lives accounted for less than 1% of all homicide deaths from 1980 to 2008. These homicides, most of which are shootings, increased as a share of all homicides from 0.5% in 1980 to 0.8% in 2008, according to the bureau’s data. A Congressional Research Service report, using a definition of four deaths or more, counted 547 deaths from mass shootings in the U.S. from 1983 to 2012.

Looking at the larger topic of firearm deaths, there were 31,672 deaths from guns in the U.S. in 2010. Most (19,392) were suicides; the gun suicide rate has been higher than the gun homicide rate since at least 1981, and the gap is wider than it was in 1981.

Knowledge About Crime

Despite the attention to gun violence in recent months, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is markedly lower than it was two decades ago. A new Pew Research Center survey (March 14-17) found that 56% of Americans believe the number of crimes involving a gun is higher than it was 20 years ago; only 12% say it is lower and 26% say it stayed the same. (An additional 6% did not know or did not answer.)

Men (46%) are less likely than women (65%) to say long-term gun crime is up. Young adults, ages 18 to 29, are markedly less likely than other adults to say long-term crime is up—44% do, compared with more than half of other adults. Minority adults are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to say that long-term gun crime is up, 62% compared with 53%.

Asked about trends in the number of gun crimes “in recent years,” a plurality of 45% believe the number has gone up, 39% say it is about the same and 10% say it has gone down. (An additional 5% did not know or did not answer.) As with long-term crime, women (57%) are more likely than men (32%) to say that gun crime has increased in recent years. So are non-white adults (54%) compared with whites (41%). Adults ages 50 and older (51%) are more likely than those ages 18-49 (42%) to believe gun crime is up.

What is Behind the Crime Decline?

Researchers continue to debate the key factors behind changing crime rates, which is part of a larger discussion about the predictors of crime. There is consensus that demographics played some role: The outsized post-World War II baby boom, which produced a large number of people in the high-crime ages of 15 to 20 in the 1960s and 1970s, helped drive crime up in those years.

A review by the National Academy of Sciences of factors driving recent crime trends (Blumstein and Rosenfeld, 2008) cited a decline in rates in the early 1980s as the young boomers got older, then a flare-up by mid-decade in conjunction with a rising street market for crack cocaine, especially in big cities. It noted recruitment of a younger cohort of drug seller with greater willingness to use guns. By the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime.

At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group. It is less clear, researchers say, that innovative policing strategies and police crackdowns on use of guns by younger adults played a significant role in reducing crime.

Some researchers have proposed additional explanations as to why crime levels plunged so suddenly, including increased access to abortion and lessened exposure to lead. According to one hypothesis, legalization of abortion after the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision resulted in fewer unwanted births, and unwanted children have an increased risk of growing up to become criminals. Another theory links reduced crime to 1970s-era reductions in lead in gasoline; children’s exposure to lead causes brain damage that could be associated with violent behavior. The National Academy of Sciences review said it was unlikely that either played a major role, but researchers continue to explore both factors.

The plateau in national violent crime rates has raised interest in the topic of how local differences might influence crime levels and trends. Crime reductions took place across the country in the 1990s, but since 2000, patterns have varied more by metropolitan area or city.

One focus of interest is that gun ownership varies widely by region and locality. The National Academy of Sciences review of possible influences on crime trends said there is good evidence of a link between firearm ownership and firearm homicide at the local level; “the causal direction of this relationship remains in dispute, however, with some researchers maintaining that firearm violence elevates rates of gun ownership, but not the reverse.”

There is substantial variation within and across regions and localities in a number of other realms, which complicates any attempt to find a single cause for national trends. Among the variations of interest to researchers are policing techniques, punishment policies, culture, economics and residential segregation.

Internationally, a decline in crime, especially property crime, has been documented in many countries since the mid-1990s. According to the authors of a 30-country study on criminal victimization (Van Dijk et al., 2007), there is no general agreement on all the reasons for this decline. They say there is a general consensus that demographic change—specifically, the shrinking proportion of adolescents across Europe—is a common factor causing decreases across Western countries. They also cite wider use of security measures in homes and businesses as a factor in reducing property crime.

But other potential explanations—such as better policing or increased imprisonment—do not apply in Europe, where policies vary widely, the report noted

Among the major findings of this Pew Research Center report:

U.S. Firearm Deaths

In 2010, there were 3.6 gun homicides per 100,000 people, compared with 7.0 in 1993, according to CDC data.

In 2010, CDC data counted 11,078 gun homicide deaths, compared with 18,253 in 1993.

Men and boys make up the vast majority (84% in 2010) of gun homicide victims. The firearm homicide rate also is more than five times as high for males of all ages (6.2 deaths per 100,000 people) as it is for females (1.1 deaths per 100,000 people).

By age group, 69% of gun homicide victims in 2010 were ages 18 to 40, an age range that was 31% of the population that year. Gun homicide rates also are highest for adults ages 18 to 24 and 25 to 40.

A disproportionate share of gun homicide victims are black (55% in 2010, compared with the 13% black share of the population). Whites were 25% of victims but 65% of the population in 2010. Hispanics were 17% of victims and 16% of the population in 2010.

The firearm suicide rate (6.3 per 100,000 people) is higher than the firearm homicide rate and has come down less sharply. The number of gun suicide deaths (19,392 in 2010) outnumbered gun homicides, as has been true since at least 1981.

U.S. Firearm Crime Victimization

In 2011, the NCVS estimated there were 181.5 gun crime victimizations for non-fatal violent crime (aggravated assault, robbery and sex crimes) per 100,000 Americans ages 12 and older, compared with 725.3 in 1993.

In terms of numbers, the NCVS estimated there were about 1.5 million non-fatal gun crime victimizations in 1993 among U.S. residents ages 12 and older, compared with 467,000 in 2011.

U.S. Other Non-fatal Crime

The victimization rate for all non-fatal violent crime among those ages 12 and older—simple and aggravated assaults, robberies and sex crimes, with or without firearms—dropped 53% from 1993 to 2000, and 49% from 2000 to 2010. It rose 17% from 2010 to 2011.

Although not the topic of this report, the rate of property crimes—burglary, motor vehicle theft and theft—also declined from 1993 to 2011, by 61%. The rate for these types of crimes was 351.8 per 100,000 people ages 12 and older in 1993, 190.4 in 2000 and 138.7 in 2011.

Context

The number of firearms available for sale to or possessed by U.S. civilians (about 310 million in 2009, according to the Congressional Research Service) has grown in recent years, and the 2009 per capita rate of one person per gun had roughly doubled since 1968. It is not clear, though, how many U.S. households own guns or whether that share has changed over time.

Crime stories accounted for 17% of the total time devoted to news on local television broadcasts in 2012, compared with 29% in 2005, according to Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. Crime trails only traffic and weather as the most common type of story on these newscasts.

About the Data Findings in this report are based on two main data sources: Data on homicides and other deaths are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on information from death certificates filed in state vital statistics offices, which includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners. Data also include demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants. Population data, used in constructing rates, come from the Census Bureau. Most statistics were obtained via the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), available from URL: www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars. Data are available beginning in 1981; suitable population data do not exist for prior years. For more details, see Appendix 4. Estimates of crime victimization are from the National Crime Victimization Survey, a sample survey conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statistics by the Census Bureau. Although the survey began in 1973, this report uses data since 1993, the first year employing an intensive methodological redesign. The survey collects information about crimes against people and households, but not businesses. It provides estimates of victimization for the population ages 12 and older living in households and non-institutional group quarters; therefore it does not include populations such as homeless people, visiting foreign tourists and business travelers, or those living in institutions such as military barracks or mental hospitals. The survey collects information about the crimes of rape, sexual assault, personal robbery, aggravated and simple assault, household burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft. For more details, see Appendix 4.

Roadmap to the Report

The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 explores trends in firearm homicide and all firearm deaths, as well as patterns by gender, race and age. Chapter 3 analyzes trends in non-fatal violent gun crime victimizations, as well as patterns by gender, race and age. Chapter 4 looks at trends and subgroup patterns for non-fatal violent crime victimizations overall. Chapter 5 examines issues related to the topic of firearms: crime news, crime as a public priority, U.S. gun ownership data, and comparison of ownership and crime rates with those in other nations. Appendices 1-3 consist of detailed tables with annual data for firearm deaths, homicides and suicides, as well as non-fatal firearm and overall non-fatal violent crime victimization, for all groups and by subgroup. Appendix 4 explains the report’s methodology.

Notes on Terminology

All references to whites, blacks and others are to the non-Hispanic components of those populations. Hispanics can be of any race.

“Aggravated assault,” as defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is an attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of whether an injury occurred, and an attack without a weapon when serious injury results.

The terms “firearm” and “gun” are used interchangeably.

“Homicides,” which come from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, are fatal injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill. Deaths due to legal intervention or operations of war are excluded. Justifiable homicide is not identified.

“Robbery,” as defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is a completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of property or cash by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and with or without injury.

“Sex crime,” as defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, includes attempted rape, rape and sexual assault.

“Simple assault,” as defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is an attack (or attempted assault) without a weapon resulting either in no injury, minor injury (for example, bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches or swelling) or in undetermined injury requiring less than two days of hospitalization.

“Victimization” is based on self-reporting in the National Crime Victimization Survey, which includes Americans ages 12 and older. For personal crimes (which in this report include assault, robbery and sex crime), it is expressed as a rate based on the number of victimizations per 100,000 U.S. residents ages 12 and older. See the Methodology appendix for more details.

A marathon Democratic filibuster in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre came to an end in the US Senate on Thursday morning after Republicans apparently agreed to hold votes on tighter gun control measures .
Chris Murphy , a Connecticut Democrat , led the filibuster which lasted for more than 14 hours along with several colleagues . In the early hours of Thursday morning in Washington , Murphy said a deal had been struck with Republican leaders to hold votes on key measures .
Murphy yielded the floor at 2.11am , saying he had won commitments from Republican leaders that they would hold votes on amendments to expand background checks and ban gun sales to suspected terrorists .
Chris Murphy ( @ ChrisMurphyCT ) I am proud to announce that after 14+ hours on the floor , we will have a vote on closing the terror gap & universal background checks

A marathon Democratic filibuster in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre came to an end in the US Senate on Thursday morning after Republicans apparently agreed to hold votes on tighter gun control measures.

Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, led the filibuster which lasted for more than 14 hours along with several colleagues. In the early hours of Thursday morning in Washington, Murphy said a deal had been struck with Republican leaders to hold votes on key measures.

Murphy yielded the floor at 2.11am, saying he had won commitments from Republican leaders that they would hold votes on amendments to expand background checks and ban gun sales to suspected terrorists.

Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) I am proud to announce that after 14+ hours on the floor, we will have a vote on closing the terror gap & universal background checks

Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) This is one step. The fight is far from over. But there are millions of voices calling for change. And we cannot stop pushing #Enough

Funerals are held for two of the 26 school shooting victims , both of them 6-year-olds
As relatives began to say their final goodbyes to their slain children , investigators in Connecticut worked Monday to better understand what happened to them , including digging deeper into the gun and computer use of the 20-year-old man who ended their lives .
In recent days , authorities have established that Adam Lanza shot open an entrance into Newtown 's Sandy Hook Elementary School . He fired multiple magazines -- each one with 30 bullets -- from a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill six adults and 20 children from two classrooms . Each victim was shot multiple times before Lanza used a handgun to kill himself .
Why ? Authorities have n't given a motive . But they are looking into shards of the remnants of the shooter 's smashed home computer -- -- including e-mails he may have sent and websites he may have visited -- hoping it will shed light on his thinking , a law enforcement official said Monday .
Authorities are also probing Lanza 's history with firearms . The three weapons found near his dead body were the semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster and two handguns made by Glock and Sig Sauer . A shotgun was found in his car nearby , according to Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance .
The weapons belonged to his mother , Nancy Lanza , who was found shot dead in her Newtown home Friday . She collected firearms , shot them and went to gun ranges , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Debora Seifert said Monday .
The mother and the son who killed her even went to a range together . From what the ATF has been able to determine thus far , `` their most recent visit was more than six months ago , '' Seifert said .
Beyond such developments , officials overall were tight-lipped Monday about their investigation . Hundreds of state troopers , detectives and other law enforcement personnel are analyzing every round of ammunition fired , examining the gunman 's medical history and talking to witnesses , said Vance , the state police spokesman .
Investigators plan to interview a pair of adults wounded `` in their lower extremities . '' The hope is the two -- whom authorities have not identified , though a parent last week said one was a vice principal at the school -- could , `` when it 's medically appropriate , '' play a key role in helping to reconstruct what happened , said Vance .
`` I 'm not at liberty to discuss any of the information so far uncovered , but suffice it to say ... we will cover every single facet , '' the police spokesman said of the investigation .

The 6-year-old himself was a budding athlete . Shortly before his death , he wrestled in his first match and earned a medal , said New Milford Youth Wrestling Association President Ken Linder .

Ex-school official : Lanza would 'withdraw into his own little world '
When he was the Newtown public schools ' director of security , Richard Novia knew Adam Lanza . In high school , the then-teen had psychological issues and would sometimes `` withdraw into his own little world , '' Novia said .
`` I interacted with that boy daily for several years , '' Novia told Nancy Grace from HLN , CNN 's sister network . `` And I can tell you that there was no indication he would carry out a heinous act . ''
Lanza worked with Novia in Newtown High 's Tech Club , with his mother -- who the former security director described as `` doting '' and very involved in her children 's lives -- often taking part in its activities . She 'd also be called to the school when Adam Lanza `` would have little episodes ... where he could not ... talk or communicate , even what he was feeling . ''
Citing local school authorities , Vance said Monday there was `` no connection '' between the shooter and with the elementary school he targeted . Cynthia Jaroszewksi , though , told CNN that Lanza once attended that school and was even in the same first- and third-grade classes as her daughter , Rebecca .
As to Sandy Hook 's current students and faculty , they will be out of school `` until further notice , '' Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said .
When classes do resume , it will be in a different place .
Authorities have said Sandy Hook students and staff will be at Chalk Hill Elementary in neighboring Monroe , Connecticut , with Gov . Dannel Malloy saying he 's signed an order to expedite such a move . In fact , moving trucks were parked outside the Newtown school Monday , to transport supplies and equipment to their home .
School will be in session for other students in town Tuesday , albeit after a 2-hour delay .
`` Be assured that the safety of your children and our staff are our first priority , '' Superintendent Janet Robinson told parents in an e-mail . `` ( Police ) Chief ( Michael ) Kehoe along with his colleagues from the State Police and surrounding communities are implementing a security plan which will provide increased presence at all of our schools . ''
Preventing future Newtowns is n't just on Connecticut residents ' minds . The massacre has spurred talk nationwide about gun violence and how to prevent it .
President Barack Obama 's call for change was the centerpiece of his address Sunday night at Newtown High School . Referencing other mass shootings over the last two years , he said Americans ca n't `` honestly say we 're doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm . ''
To that end , Obama promised , `` In the coming weeks , I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals , to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . ''
While gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association have been largely silent since Friday 's shooting , others have spoken up .
Malloy , Connecticut 's governor , said Monday , `` I 'd love to hear the people argue that we need 30-round magazines and that 's somehow tied to the right to bear arms . We 're not talking about basic weapons that are used in hunting . ''
Sen. Joe Manchin , a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and `` proud gun owner , '' said he 's now committed to `` dialogue that would bring a total change '' given what happened in Newtown .
`` Who would have ever thought , in America or anywhere in the world , that children would be slaughtered ? '' he told CNN . `` It 's changed me . ''
The debate is playing out not just in Washington , but across America .
John Licata told CNN 's iReport there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns , and assault weapons should be banned -- something Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , says she 'll propose once the new Congress convenes in January .
CNN iReporter Jameson Riley said the shooting shows the need for more armed guards in schools . Riley , a gun owner , said recent mass shootings have made him consider getting a concealed weapon permit .
`` I have a 2-year-old daughter , and she is the light of my life , '' he said . `` And I would like to protect her . ''
Others said Americans should n't change how they live , contending that doing so is a victory for perpetrators of violence .","Story highlights An ex-school official says Lanza sometimes withdrew ""into his own little world""

When classes do resume, it will be in a different place.

Authorities have said Sandy Hook students and staff will be at Chalk Hill Elementary in neighboring Monroe, Connecticut, with Gov. Dannel Malloy saying he's signed an order to expedite such a move. In fact, moving trucks were parked outside the Newtown school Monday, to transport supplies and equipment to their home.

School will be in session for other students in town Tuesday, albeit after a 2-hour delay.

""Be assured that the safety of your children and our staff are our first priority,"" Superintendent Janet Robinson told parents in an e-mail. ""(Police) Chief (Michael) Kehoe along with his colleagues from the State Police and surrounding communities are implementing a security plan which will provide increased presence at all of our schools.""

Massacre stirs debate about gun control

Preventing future Newtowns isn't just on Connecticut residents' minds. The massacre has spurred talk nationwide about gun violence and how to prevent it.

President Barack Obama's call for change was the centerpiece of his address Sunday night at Newtown High School. Referencing other mass shootings over the last two years, he said Americans can't ""honestly say we're doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm.""

To that end, Obama promised, ""In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals, to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.""

While gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association have been largely silent since Friday's shooting, others have spoken up.

Malloy, Connecticut's governor, said Monday, ""I'd love to hear the people argue that we need 30-round magazines and that's somehow tied to the right to bear arms. We're not talking about basic weapons that are used in hunting.""

Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and ""proud gun owner,"" said he's now committed to ""dialogue that would bring a total change"" given what happened in Newtown.

""Who would have ever thought, in America or anywhere in the world, that children would be slaughtered?"" he told CNN. ""It's changed me.""

The debate is playing out not just in Washington, but across America.

John Licata told CNN's iReport there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns, and assault weapons should be banned -- something Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, says she'll propose once the new Congress convenes in January.

CNN iReporter Jameson Riley said the shooting shows the need for more armed guards in schools. Riley, a gun owner, said recent mass shootings have made him consider getting a concealed weapon permit.

""I have a 2-year-old daughter, and she is the light of my life,"" he said. ""And I would like to protect her.""

Others said Americans shouldn't change how they live, contending that doing so is a victory for perpetrators of violence.",www.cnn.com,left,eRrAayQp9V5LsRWv

The Supreme Court rarely takes up Second Amendment cases, so when it does, gun owners know their rights are in the cross hairs.

The Abramski ruling will be key to determining how far President Obama can push his gun-control agenda. Mr. Obama wants to expand background checks to include private transactions so that the government would know exactly who has a gun. That is not what the Founding Fathers intended.

On Wednesday, the high court heard oral arguments in Bruce J. Abramskiv. United States. The justices will decide whether to overturn an appeals court decision that said Mr. Abramski broke federal straw purchasing laws when he bought a gun with the intent to resell it to his elderly uncle, even though neither man is prohibited from ownership.

The court will have to reconcile conflicting rulings in lower appeals courts on whether a gun purchaser’s intent to ever transfer a gun in the future to a legal person is relevant in the background check at the time of purchase.

Mr. Abramski, a former police officer, bought the firearm in his home state of Virginia in 2009 because he could get a good price as former law enforcement.

His uncle, Angel Alvarez, sent a check for $400 with the note “Glock 19 handgun” in the memo line. Mr. Abramski called three licensed firearms dealers in advance to ensure he did the transaction lawfully.

At the store, Mr. Abramski filled out the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) background check form No. 4473. Question 11a reads: “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form?”

Mr. Abramski checked the “yes” box. If he had checked “no,” he would not have been allowed to buy the gun. He passed the National Instant Background Check (NICS) and left the store with the pistol.

Don’t forget: Michael Bloomberg founded a gun control group and paid these people to travel around the east coast and read lists of “gun violence” victims at stops and these people included the names of the Boston Bomber and justifiable homicides. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) March 3, 2020

I noted in my first book how Bloomberg paid people in his gun control groups to promote shootings that didn’t actually happen *on* school grounds (i.e. a late night drug deal a block over) as “school shootings” to scare people. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) March 3, 2020

Dana is right. Bloomberg wants to tout his gun control credentials, then he needs to be asked specific questions about his knowledge and his policy merits. The sad part is most journalists aren't well-versed enough in firearms and gun policy to know when they're being duped.",www.townhall.com,right,TNjfz1nOw2t1dCqz

Tuccille, Eric Boehm, Orin S. Kerr, Charles Oliver, David Post, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","No nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court has had such a detailed record on Second Amendment as does Brett Kavanaugh . His 2011 dissenting opinion in the case known as Heller II was consistent with his long-standing adherence to text , history , tradition , and Supreme Court precedent .
Background : In 2008 , the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that the Second Amendment is an individual right , and is not limited only to militiamen . The Court carefully examined the text of the Second Amendment and the history of the right from early England through Reconstruction . The Court held two D.C. ordinances to violate the Second Amendment : a handgun ban and a prohibition on using any firearm in the home for self-defense . The District also forbade all gun carrying without a permit , even carrying shotgun from one 's bedroom to the basement for cleaning . Carry permits were never issued . The Court ordered D.C. to issue Dick Heller a carry permit .
Following the Supreme Court decision , the D.C. Council enacted very restrictive gun controls . A new lawsuit resulted , among whose plaintiffs were Mr. Heller . In the 2011 case known as Heller II , a 2-1 panel of the D.C . Circuit upheld some of the new D.C. ordinances and remanded others to the district court . Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion . Later , in 2015 's Heller III , another 2-1 D.C . Circuit panel ( not including Judge Kavanaugh ) upheld some more of the D.C. laws and held others unconstitutional . ( Here 's my analysis of Heller III . )
The 2011 Heller II majority opinion has had broad influence in the lower federal courts . ( For details : Kopel & Greenlee , The Federal Circuits ' Second Amendment Doctrines , St. Louis University Law Journal ( 2017 ) ) . Judge Kavanaugh offered a different approach .
Judge Kavanaugh noted the controversy over gun control , and cited articles by Judges Richard Posner and J. Harvie Wilkinson , III , which criticized the Heller decision . ( Here 's a critique of Judge Wilkinson 's critique . ) `` As a lower court , however , it is not our role to re-litigate Heller or to bend it in any particular direction . Our sole job is to faithfully apply Heller and the approach it set forth for analyzing gun bans and regulations . ''
The new D.C. law banned many semi-automatic rifles . The prohibition was acknowledged to be the broadest in the United States . Judge Kavanaugh explained that Heller prevents a ban on semi-automatic handguns , and the same reasoning applies to similar rifles :
In Heller , the Supreme Court held that handguns—the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic—are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens . There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles . Semi-automatic rifles , like semi-automatic handguns , have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home , hunting , and other lawful uses . Moreover , semi-automatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are . It follows from Heller 's protection of semi-automatic handguns that semi-automatic rifles are also constitutionally protected and that D.C. 's ban on them is unconstitutional . ( By contrast , fully automatic weapons , also known as machine guns , have traditionally been banned and may continue to be banned after Heller . )
D.C. 's registration requirement , which is significantly more stringent than any other federal or state gun law in the United States , is likewise unconstitutional . Heller and later McDonald [ v. Chicago , 2010 ] said that regulations on the sale , possession , or use of guns are permissible if they are within the class of traditional , `` longstanding '' gun regulations in the United States . Registration of all lawfully possessed guns—as distinct from licensing of gun owners or mandatory record-keeping by gun sellers—has not traditionally been required in the United States and even today remains highly unusual . Under Heller 's history-and tradition-based test , D.C. 's registration requirement is therefore unconstitutional .
Indeed , Heller largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States . Heller established that traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible . The Supreme Court simply pushed back against an outlier local law—D.C . 's handgun ban—that went far beyond the traditional line of gun regulation . As Heller emphasized : `` Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District 's '' law . 554 U.S. at 629 . …D.C . appeared to push the envelope again , with its new ban on semi-automatic rifles and its broad gun registration requirement . D.C. 's public safety motivation in enacting these laws is worthy of great respect . But the means D.C. has chosen are again constitutionally problematic . The D.C. gun provisions at issue here , like the ban at issue in Heller , are outliers that are not traditional or common in the United States . As with D.C. 's handgun ban , therefore , holding these D.C. laws unconstitutional would not lead to nationwide tumult . Rather , such a holding would maintain the balance historically and traditionally struck in the United States between public safety and the individual right to keep arms—a history and tradition that Heller affirmed and adopted as determining the scope of the Second Amendment right .
In Judge Kavanaugh 's view , `` gun bans and regulations '' should `` be analyzed based on the Second Amendment 's text , history , and tradition ( as well as by appropriate analogues thereto when dealing with modern weapons and new circumstances… '' He did not think judges should `` re-calibrate the scope of the Second Amendment right based on judicial assessment of whether the law advances a sufficiently compelling or important government interest to override the individual right . '' In his view , Heller had been clear that Second Amendment cases should be decided `` based on text , history , and tradition , not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny . ''
Judge Kavanaugh 's dissent detailed how the Heller opinion relied on `` text , history , and tradition . '' So too was McDonald v. Chicago , he argued . ( McDonald , decided in 2010 , held that the Second Amendment applies to state and local governments , thanks to the Fourteenth Amendment . ) He noted that this approach was compatible with gun control :
Indeed , governments appear to have more flexibility and power to impose gun regulations under a test based on text , history , and tradition than they would under strict scrutiny . After all , history and tradition show that a variety of gun regulations have co-existed with the Second Amendment right and are consistent with that right , as the Court said in Heller . By contrast , if courts applied strict scrutiny , then presumably very few gun regulations would be upheld .
The text/history/tradition standard is `` much less subjective because `` it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of reasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico-political First Principles whose combined conclusion can be found to point in any direction the judges favor . '' ( Quoting Justice Scalia 's concurrence in McDonald ) . Although historical inquiry may involve difficult questions , `` the range of potential answers will be far more focused under an approach based on text , history , and tradition than under an interest-balancing test such as intermediate scrutiny . ''
What about `` when legislatures seek to address new weapons that have not traditionally existed or to impose new gun regulations because of conditions that have not traditionally existed '' ? Then , `` in such cases , the proper interpretive approach is to ███ by analogy from history and tradition . ''
Not everything that is traditional is necessarily constitutional , Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a footnote . `` [ P ] post-ratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously can not overcome or alter that text . '' For example , `` The practice of separate but equal was inconsistent with and repugnant to the text and original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause . See Brown v. Bd . of Education , 347 U.S. 483 873 ( 1954 ) ; Strauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 ( 1880 ) . ''
If an interest balancing test were to be used , it should be strict scrutiny :
A ban on a class of arms is not an `` incidental '' regulation . It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech . Such restrictions on core enumerated constitutional protections are not subjected to mere intermediate scrutiny review . The majority opinion here is in uncharted territory in suggesting that intermediate scrutiny can apply to an outright ban on possession of a class of weapons that have not traditionally been banned . … The vast majority of handguns today are semi-automatic . In Heller , the Supreme Court ruled that D.C. 's law banning handguns , including semi-automatic handguns , was unconstitutional . District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U.S. 570 , 628–29 ( 2008 ) . This case concerns semi-automatic rifles . As with handguns , a significant percentage of rifles are semi-automatic… . [ I ] t would strain logic and common sense to conclude that the Second Amendment protects semi-automatic handguns but does not protect semi-automatic rifles… . [ T ] he Second Amendment as construed in Heller protects weapons that have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens . Semi-automatic rifles have not traditionally been banned and are in common use today , and are thus protected under Heller .
As Justice Kavanaugh explained , semi-automatic rifles date back to the Winchesters and Remingtons of 1903-06 . Meanwhile , `` The first semi-automatic shotgun , designed by John Browning and manufactured by Remington , hit the market in 1905 and was a runaway commercial success….Many of the early semi-automatic rifles were available with pistol grips . These semi-automatic rifles were designed and marketed primarily for use as hunting rifles , with a small ancillary market among law enforcement officers . '' ( citing John Henwood , The Forgotten Winchesters . ) `` Semi-automatic rifles remain in common use today , as even the majority opinion here acknowledges . ''
Although a few states and municipalities ban some categories of semi-automatic rifles , most of the country does not , and even the bans that exist are significantly narrower than D.C. 's . What the Supreme Court said in Heller as to D.C. 's handgun ban thus applies just as well to D.C. 's new semi-automatic rifle ban : `` Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District 's '' law . 554 U.S. at 629 . … in its 1994 decision in Staples , the Supreme Court already stated that semi-automatic weapons `` traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful possessions . '' 511 U.S. at 612 . Indeed , the precise weapon at issue in Staples was the AR-15 . The AR-15 is the quintessential semi-automatic rifle that D.C. seeks to ban here . Yet as the Supreme Court noted in Staples , the AR-15 is in common use by law-abiding citizens and has traditionally been lawful to possess .
The D.C. law also banned magazines over 10 rounds . The majority upheld the ban , but Judge Kavanaugh would have remanded for fact-finding :
In order to apply Heller 's test to this prohibition , we must know whether magazines with more than 10 rounds have traditionally been banned and are not in common use . The parties here did not brief that question in much detail . Evidence presented to the District Court on the history and prevalence of magazines of more than 10 rounds would be helpful to the proper disposition of that issue under the Heller test . Therefore , I would remand to the District Court for analysis of that issue .
( Those questions are addressed in my article The History of Firearms Magazines and Magazine Prohibitions . )
In balancing interests , the panel majority had weighed the interests wrongly :
The majority opinion next contends that semi-automatic handguns are good enough to meet people 's needs for self-defense and that they should n't need semi-automatic rifles . But that 's a bit like saying books can be banned because people can always read newspapers . That is not a persuasive or legitimate way to analyze a law that directly infringes an enumerated constitutional right . Indeed , Heller itself specifically rejected this mode of reasoning : `` It is no answer to say , as petitioners do , that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms ( i.e. , long guns ) is allowed . '' 554 U.S. at 629 .
So `` D.C. 's at-least-you-can-still-possess-other-kinds-of-guns argument is no more persuasive this time around . ''
The majority had also failed to consider the rights of hunters :
Furthermore , the majority opinion 's assertion does not sufficiently account for the fact that rifles , but typically not handguns , are used for hunting . Cf . Heller , 554 U.S. at 599 ( most founding-era Americans `` undoubtedly '' thought right to own firearms `` even more important for self-defense and hunting '' than for militia service ) .
Judge Kavanaugh was skeptical of `` the rhetorical term 'assault weapon ' '' and of labeling the banned guns `` offensive . '' The guns are used in crime much less often than handguns are . Semiautomatic rifles fire at the same rate as semiautomatic handguns , which ca n't be banned . `` [ I ] t is the person , not the gun , who determines whether use of the gun is offensive or defensive . ''
Under intermediate scrutiny , yet another problem with D.C. 's law is its tailoring . The law is not sufficiently tailored even with respect to the category of semi-automatic rifles . It bans certain semi-automatic rifles but not others—with no particular explanation or rationale for why some made the list and some did not . The list appears to be haphazard . It does not reflect the kind of tailoring that is necessary to justify infringement of a fundamental right , even under the more relaxed intermediate scrutiny test .
D.C. unusual gun registration ordinances fail the history and tradition test
The Supreme Court in Heller had affirmed the permissibility of certain `` longstanding '' gun controls .
The fundamental problem with D.C. 's gun registration law is that registration of lawfully possessed guns is not `` longstanding . '' Registration of all guns lawfully possessed by citizens in the relevant jurisdiction has not been traditionally required in the United States and , indeed , remains highly unusual today .
Licensing requirements mandate that gun owners meet certain standards or pass certain tests before owning guns or using them in particular ways . Those laws can advance gun safety by ensuring that owners understand how to handle guns safely , particularly before guns are carried in public . For example , many jurisdictions that permit the carrying of concealed weapons have traditionally imposed licensing requirements on persons who wish to carry such weapons . Registration requirements , by contrast , require registration of individual guns and do not meaningfully serve the purpose of ensuring that owners know how to operate guns safely in the way certain licensing requirements can . For that ███ , registration requirements are often seen as half-a-loaf measures aimed at deterring gun ownership… . Likewise , it 's also important at the outset to distinguish registration requirements imposed on gun owners from record-keeping requirements imposed on gun sellers . Some record-keeping requirements on gun sellers are traditional and common . Thus , the government may constitutionally impose certain record-keeping requirements on the sellers of guns . See Heller , 554 U.S. at 627 ( listing `` conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms '' as being within category of traditional gun regulations ) . … There certainly is no tradition in the United States of gun registration imposed on all guns .
Even compared to the few states that do have gun registration , `` It is undisputed in this case that D.C. 's myriad registration-related requirements are unique—and uniquely burdensome—among laws in the United States . '' Thus , the D.C. registration system violated the test of history and tradition .
It was true that early American militia laws required militiamen to show that they possessed the mandatory arms . But `` those early militia laws applied only to militiamen , not to all citizens… . Second , militia members were required to submit for inspection only one or a few firearms , not all of their firearms . That 's because the purpose of those early militia requirements was not registration of firearms , but rather simply to ensure that the militia was well-equipped . '' So `` Yet again , what the Supreme Court said in Heller with respect to D.C. 's handgun ban applies as well to D.C. 's registration requirement : 'Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District 's ' law . ''
An earlier Supreme Court case on gun control ( U.S. v. Miller , 1939 ) , had examined a prosecution for possession of an unregistered firearm . ( The National Firearms Act of 1934 required registration for short-barreled shotguns and rifles , and for machine guns ) .
If registration were constitutionally permissible for all lawfully possessed guns , the Court could simply have affirmed the conviction on that ground . Instead , the Miller Court analyzed whether the kind of gun Miller possessed—a sawed-off shotgun—was within the class of weapons protected by the Second Amendment . The Court 's approach suggested that the government could require registration only of guns that were outside the protection of the Second Amendment—namely , those classes of guns that the government had traditionally banned and that were not in common use , such as machine guns and sawed-off shotguns .
To begin with , it would be hard to persuasively say that the government has an interest sufficiently weighty to justify a regulation that infringes constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment rights if the Federal Government and the states have not traditionally imposed—and even now do not commonly impose—such a regulation .
D.C. had n't offered a persuasive rationale for the registration law , but perhaps it could do so if it got another chance in district court :
Moreover , D.C. 's articulated basis for the registration requirement is that police officers , when approaching a house to execute a search or arrest warrant or take other investigative steps , will know whether the residents have guns . But that is at best a Swiss-cheese rationale because police officers obviously will assume the occupants might be armed regardless of what some central registration list might say . So this asserted rationale leaves far too many false negatives to satisfy strict or intermediate scrutiny with respect to burdens on a fundamental individual constitutional right . D.C. 's registration law thus does not appear to be sufficiently tailored to advance a compelling or important government interest for purposes of the heightened scrutiny tests . That said , D.C. alludes to the possibility that other rationales might be asserted to support a registration requirement . Therefore , if I were applying a form of heightened scrutiny to the registration requirement , I would remand for further analysis of the interests that might be asserted . ( It is possible , moreover , that the registration law might pass intermediate but not strict scrutiny . )
Indeed , under the decision of the majority of the Heller II , the most novel parts of registration law were remanded to the district court for further factfinding and development . Ultimately , some of the laws were upheld and some were not , in Heller III , under intermediate scrutiny . ( As noted , Judge Kavanaugh was not on the Heller III panel . )
In conclusion , Judge Kavanaugh explained that he might favor some of the above gun controls as a matter of policy , but he thought them contrary to Supreme Court precedent :
As one who was born here , grew up in this community in the late 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , and has lived and worked in this area almost all of his life , I am acutely aware of the gun , drug , and gang violence that has plagued all of us . As a citizen , I certainly share the goal of Police Chief Cathy Lanier to reduce and hopefully eliminate the senseless violence that has persisted for too long and harmed so many . And I greatly respect the motivation behind the D.C. gun laws at issue in this case . So my view on how to analyze the constitutional question here under the relevant Supreme Court precedents is not to say that I think certain gun registration laws or laws regulating semi-automatic guns are necessarily a bad idea as a matter of policy . If our job were to decree what we think is the best policy , I would carefully consider the issues through that different lens and might well look favorably upon certain regulations of this kind . But our task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court , regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy . See Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397 , 420–21 ( 1989 ) ( Kennedy , J. , concurring ) [ striking law against flag-burning ] ( `` The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like . We make them because they are right , right in the sense that the law and the Constitution , as we see them , compel the result. '' ) . A lower-court judge has a special obligation , moreover , to strictly and faithfully follow the lead of the `` one supreme Court '' established by our Constitution , regardless of whether the judge agrees or disagrees with the precedent .
Few government objectives are more important than fighting violent crime .
That said , the Supreme Court has long made clear that the Constitution disables the government from employing certain means to prevent , deter , or detect violent crime . See , e.g. , Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 ( 1961 ) [ exclusionary rule against using illegally-seized evidence in court ] ; Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) [ arrestees must be informed of their right to counsel ] ; City of Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U.S. 32 ( 2000 ) [ against random checkpoints for motorists ] ; Crawford v. Washington , 541 U.S. 36 ( 2004 ) [ enforcing right to confront witnesses in criminal trial ] ; Kennedy v. Louisiana , 554 U.S. 407 ( 2008 ) [ death penalty only for treason or for crimes resulting in a death , not for aggravated rape ] ; District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U.S. 570 ( 2008 ) . In the words of the Supreme Court , the courts must enforce those constitutional rights even when they have `` controversial public safety implications . '' McDonald v. City of Chicago , 130 S.Ct . 3020 , 3045 ( 2010 ) ( controlling opinion of Alito , J . ) .
Judge Kavanaugh 's text , history , and tradition methodology for Second Amendment cases will not please people who believe that all gun control is impermissible , nor will it please advocates who want to make the Second Amendment a second-class right .","No nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court has had such a detailed record on Second Amendment as does Brett Kavanaugh. His 2011 dissenting opinion in the case known as Heller II was consistent with his long-standing adherence to text, history, tradition, and Supreme Court precedent.

Background: In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that the Second Amendment is an individual right, and is not limited only to militiamen. The Court carefully examined the text of the Second Amendment and the history of the right from early England through Reconstruction. The Court held two D.C. ordinances to violate the Second Amendment: a handgun ban and a prohibition on using any firearm in the home for self-defense. The District also forbade all gun carrying without a permit, even carrying shotgun from one's bedroom to the basement for cleaning. Carry permits were never issued. The Court ordered D.C. to issue Dick Heller a carry permit.

Following the Supreme Court decision, the D.C. Council enacted very restrictive gun controls. A new lawsuit resulted, among whose plaintiffs were Mr. Heller. In the 2011 case known as Heller II, a 2-1 panel of the D.C. Circuit upheld some of the new D.C. ordinances and remanded others to the district court. Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion. Later, in 2015's Heller III, another 2-1 D.C. Circuit panel (not including Judge Kavanaugh) upheld some more of the D.C. laws and held others unconstitutional. (Here's my analysis of Heller III.)

The 2011 Heller II majority opinion has had broad influence in the lower federal courts. (For details: Kopel & Greenlee, The Federal Circuits' Second Amendment Doctrines, St. Louis University Law Journal (2017)). Judge Kavanaugh offered a different approach.

""Text, history, and tradition"" methodology for Second Amendment cases

Judge Kavanaugh noted the controversy over gun control, and cited articles by Judges Richard Posner and J. Harvie Wilkinson, III, which criticized the Heller decision. (Here's a critique of Judge Wilkinson's critique.) ""As a lower court, however, it is not our role to re-litigate Heller or to bend it in any particular direction. Our sole job is to faithfully apply Heller and the approach it set forth for analyzing gun bans and regulations.""

The new D.C. law banned many semi-automatic rifles. The prohibition was acknowledged to be the broadest in the United States. Judge Kavanaugh explained that Heller prevents a ban on semi-automatic handguns, and the same reasoning applies to similar rifles:

In Heller, the Supreme Court held that handguns—the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic—are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens. There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles. Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses. Moreover, semi-automatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are. It follows from Heller's protection of semi-automatic handguns that semi-automatic rifles are also constitutionally protected and that D.C.'s ban on them is unconstitutional. (By contrast, fully automatic weapons, also known as machine guns, have traditionally been banned and may continue to be banned after Heller.)

The new D.C. gun registration laws were also unusual:

D.C.'s registration requirement, which is significantly more stringent than any other federal or state gun law in the United States, is likewise unconstitutional. Heller and later McDonald [v. Chicago, 2010] said that regulations on the sale, possession, or use of guns are permissible if they are within the class of traditional, ""longstanding"" gun regulations in the United States. Registration of all lawfully possessed guns—as distinct from licensing of gun owners or mandatory record-keeping by gun sellers—has not traditionally been required in the United States and even today remains highly unusual. Under Heller's history-and tradition-based test, D.C.'s registration requirement is therefore unconstitutional.

Judge Kavanaugh explained that Heller authorized many gun controls:

Indeed, Heller largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States. Heller established that traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible. The Supreme Court simply pushed back against an outlier local law—D.C.'s handgun ban—that went far beyond the traditional line of gun regulation. As Heller emphasized: ""Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's"" law. 554 U.S. at 629. …D.C. appeared to push the envelope again, with its new ban on semi-automatic rifles and its broad gun registration requirement. D.C.'s public safety motivation in enacting these laws is worthy of great respect. But the means D.C. has chosen are again constitutionally problematic. The D.C. gun provisions at issue here, like the ban at issue in Heller, are outliers that are not traditional or common in the United States. As with D.C.'s handgun ban, therefore, holding these D.C. laws unconstitutional would not lead to nationwide tumult. Rather, such a holding would maintain the balance historically and traditionally struck in the United States between public safety and the individual right to keep arms—a history and tradition that Heller affirmed and adopted as determining the scope of the Second Amendment right.

In Judge Kavanaugh's view, ""gun bans and regulations"" should ""be analyzed based on the Second Amendment's text, history, and tradition (as well as by appropriate analogues thereto when dealing with modern weapons and new circumstances…"" He did not think judges should ""re-calibrate the scope of the Second Amendment right based on judicial assessment of whether the law advances a sufficiently compelling or important government interest to override the individual right."" In his view, Heller had been clear that Second Amendment cases should be decided ""based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny.""

Judge Kavanaugh's dissent detailed how the Heller opinion relied on ""text, history, and tradition."" So too was McDonald v. Chicago, he argued.

Not everything that is traditional is necessarily constitutional, Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a footnote. ""[P]post-ratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text."" For example, ""The practice of separate but equal was inconsistent with and repugnant to the text and original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. See Brown v. Bd. of Education, 347 U.S. 483 873 (1954); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880).""

Why the semi-automatic ban failed heightened scrutiny

If an interest balancing test were to be used, it should be strict scrutiny:

A ban on a class of arms is not an ""incidental"" regulation. It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech. Such restrictions on core enumerated constitutional protections are not subjected to mere intermediate scrutiny review. The majority opinion here is in uncharted territory in suggesting that intermediate scrutiny can apply to an outright ban on possession of a class of weapons that have not traditionally been banned. … The vast majority of handguns today are semi-automatic. In Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that D.C.'s law banning handguns, including semi-automatic handguns, was unconstitutional. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 628–29 (2008). This case concerns semi-automatic rifles. As with handguns, a significant percentage of rifles are semi-automatic…. [I]t would strain logic and common sense to conclude that the Second Amendment protects semi-automatic handguns but does not protect semi-automatic rifles…. [T]he Second Amendment as construed in Heller protects weapons that have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens. Semi-automatic rifles have not traditionally been banned and are in common use today, and are thus protected under Heller.

As Justice Kavanaugh explained, semi-automatic rifles date back to the Winchesters and Remingtons of 1903-06. Meanwhile, ""The first semi-automatic shotgun, designed by John Browning and manufactured by Remington, hit the market in 1905 and was a runaway commercial success….Many of the early semi-automatic rifles were available with pistol grips. These semi-automatic rifles were designed and marketed primarily for use as hunting rifles, with a small ancillary market among law enforcement officers."" (citing John Henwood, The Forgotten Winchesters.) ""Semi-automatic rifles remain in common use today, as even the majority opinion here acknowledges.""

Although a few states and municipalities ban some categories of semi-automatic rifles, most of the country does not, and even the bans that exist are significantly narrower than D.C.'s. What the Supreme Court said in Heller as to D.C.'s handgun ban thus applies just as well to D.C.'s new semi-automatic rifle ban: ""Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's"" law. 554 U.S. at 629. … in its 1994 decision in Staples, the Supreme Court already stated that semi-automatic weapons ""traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful possessions."" 511 U.S. at 612. Indeed, the precise weapon at issue in Staples was the AR-15. The AR-15 is the quintessential semi-automatic rifle that D.C. seeks to ban here. Yet as the Supreme Court noted in Staples, the AR-15 is in common use by law-abiding citizens and has traditionally been lawful to possess.

The D.C. law also banned magazines over 10 rounds. The majority upheld the ban, but Judge Kavanaugh would have remanded for fact-finding:

In order to apply Heller's test to this prohibition, we must know whether magazines with more than 10 rounds have traditionally been banned and are not in common use. The parties here did not brief that question in much detail. Evidence presented to the District Court on the history and prevalence of magazines of more than 10 rounds would be helpful to the proper disposition of that issue under the Heller test. Therefore, I would remand to the District Court for analysis of that issue.

(Those questions are addressed in my article The History of Firearms Magazines and Magazine Prohibitions.)

In balancing interests, the panel majority had weighed the interests wrongly:

The majority opinion next contends that semi-automatic handguns are good enough to meet people's needs for self-defense and that they shouldn't need semi-automatic rifles. But that's a bit like saying books can be banned because people can always read newspapers. That is not a persuasive or legitimate way to analyze a law that directly infringes an enumerated constitutional right. Indeed, Heller itself specifically rejected this mode of reasoning: ""It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed."" 554 U.S. at 629.

So ""D.C.'s at-least-you-can-still-possess-other-kinds-of-guns argument is no more persuasive this time around.""

The majority had also failed to consider the rights of hunters:

Furthermore, the majority opinion's assertion does not sufficiently account for the fact that rifles, but typically not handguns, are used for hunting. Cf. Heller, 554 U.S. at 599 (most founding-era Americans ""undoubtedly"" thought right to own firearms ""even more important for self-defense and hunting"" than for militia service).

Judge Kavanaugh was skeptical of ""the rhetorical term 'assault weapon'"" and of labeling the banned guns ""offensive."" The guns are used in crime much less often than handguns are. Semiautomatic rifles fire at the same rate as semiautomatic handguns, which can't be banned. ""[I]t is the person, not the gun, who determines whether use of the gun is offensive or defensive.""

Under intermediate scrutiny, yet another problem with D.C.'s law is its tailoring. The law is not sufficiently tailored even with respect to the category of semi-automatic rifles. It bans certain semi-automatic rifles but not others—with no particular explanation or rationale for why some made the list and some did not. The list appears to be haphazard. It does not reflect the kind of tailoring that is necessary to justify infringement of a fundamental right, even under the more relaxed intermediate scrutiny test.

D.C. unusual gun registration ordinances fail the history and tradition test

The Supreme Court in Heller had affirmed the permissibility of certain ""longstanding"" gun controls.

The fundamental problem with D.C.'s gun registration law is that registration of lawfully possessed guns is not ""longstanding."" Registration of all guns lawfully possessed by citizens in the relevant jurisdiction has not been traditionally required in the United States and, indeed, remains highly unusual today.

In contrast, gunowner licensing could be appropriate:

Licensing requirements mandate that gun owners meet certain standards or pass certain tests before owning guns or using them in particular ways. Those laws can advance gun safety by ensuring that owners understand how to handle guns safely, particularly before guns are carried in public. For example, many jurisdictions that permit the carrying of concealed weapons have traditionally imposed licensing requirements on persons who wish to carry such weapons. Registration requirements, by contrast, require registration of individual guns and do not meaningfully serve the purpose of ensuring that owners know how to operate guns safely in the way certain licensing requirements can. For that reason, registration requirements are often seen as half-a-loaf measures aimed at deterring gun ownership…. Likewise, it's also important at the outset to distinguish registration requirements imposed on gun owners from record-keeping requirements imposed on gun sellers. Some record-keeping requirements on gun sellers are traditional and common. Thus, the government may constitutionally impose certain record-keeping requirements on the sellers of guns. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 627 (listing ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" as being within category of traditional gun regulations). … There certainly is no tradition in the United States of gun registration imposed on all guns.

Even compared to the few states that do have gun registration, ""It is undisputed in this case that D.C.'s myriad registration-related requirements are unique—and uniquely burdensome—among laws in the United States."" Thus, the D.C. registration system violated the test of history and tradition.

It was true that early American militia laws required militiamen to show that they possessed the mandatory arms. But ""those early militia laws applied only to militiamen, not to all citizens…. Second, militia members were required to submit for inspection only one or a few firearms, not all of their firearms. That's because the purpose of those early militia requirements was not registration of firearms, but rather simply to ensure that the militia was well-equipped."" So ""Yet again, what the Supreme Court said in Heller with respect to D.C.'s handgun ban applies as well to D.C.'s registration requirement: 'Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's' law.""

An earlier Supreme Court case on gun control (U.S. v. Miller, 1939), had examined a prosecution for possession of an unregistered firearm. (The National Firearms Act of 1934 required registration for short-barreled shotguns and rifles, and for machine guns).

If registration were constitutionally permissible for all lawfully possessed guns, the Court could simply have affirmed the conviction on that ground. Instead, the Miller Court analyzed whether the kind of gun Miller possessed—a sawed-off shotgun—was within the class of weapons protected by the Second Amendment. The Court's approach suggested that the government could require registration only of guns that were outside the protection of the Second Amendment—namely, those classes of guns that the government had traditionally banned and that were not in common use, such as machine guns and sawed-off shotguns.

Why the registration laws fail heightened scrutiny

To begin with, it would be hard to persuasively say that the government has an interest sufficiently weighty to justify a regulation that infringes constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment rights if the Federal Government and the states have not traditionally imposed—and even now do not commonly impose—such a regulation.

D.C. hadn't offered a persuasive rationale for the registration law, but perhaps it could do so if it got another chance in district court:

Moreover, D.C.'s articulated basis for the registration requirement is that police officers, when approaching a house to execute a search or arrest warrant or take other investigative steps, will know whether the residents have guns. But that is at best a Swiss-cheese rationale because police officers obviously will assume the occupants might be armed regardless of what some central registration list might say. So this asserted rationale leaves far too many false negatives to satisfy strict or intermediate scrutiny with respect to burdens on a fundamental individual constitutional right. D.C.'s registration law thus does not appear to be sufficiently tailored to advance a compelling or important government interest for purposes of the heightened scrutiny tests. That said, D.C. alludes to the possibility that other rationales might be asserted to support a registration requirement. Therefore, if I were applying a form of heightened scrutiny to the registration requirement, I would remand for further analysis of the interests that might be asserted. (It is possible, moreover, that the registration law might pass intermediate but not strict scrutiny.)

Indeed, under the decision of the majority of the Heller II, the most novel parts of registration law were remanded to the district court for further factfinding and development. Ultimately, some of the laws were upheld and some were not, in Heller III, under intermediate scrutiny. (As noted, Judge Kavanaugh was not on the Heller III panel.)

In conclusion, Judge Kavanaugh explained that he might favor some of the above gun controls as a matter of policy, but he thought them contrary to Supreme Court precedent:

As one who was born here, grew up in this community in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and has lived and worked in this area almost all of his life, I am acutely aware of the gun, drug, and gang violence that has plagued all of us. As a citizen, I certainly share the goal of Police Chief Cathy Lanier to reduce and hopefully eliminate the senseless violence that has persisted for too long and harmed so many. And I greatly respect the motivation behind the D.C. gun laws at issue in this case. So my view on how to analyze the constitutional question here under the relevant Supreme Court precedents is not to say that I think certain gun registration laws or laws regulating semi-automatic guns are necessarily a bad idea as a matter of policy. If our job were to decree what we think is the best policy, I would carefully consider the issues through that different lens and might well look favorably upon certain regulations of this kind. But our task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy. See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 420–21 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring) [striking law against flag-burning] (""The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like. We make them because they are right, right in the sense that the law and the Constitution, as we see them, compel the result.""). A lower-court judge has a special obligation, moreover, to strictly and faithfully follow the lead of the ""one supreme Court"" established by our Constitution, regardless of whether the judge agrees or disagrees with the precedent.

Few government objectives are more important than fighting violent crime.

That said, the Supreme Court has long made clear that the Constitution disables the government from employing certain means to prevent, deter, or detect violent crime. See, e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961) [exclusionary rule against using illegally-seized evidence in court]; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) [arrestees must be informed of their right to counsel]; City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000) [against random checkpoints for motorists]; Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004) [enforcing right to confront witnesses in criminal trial]; Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008) [death penalty only for treason or for crimes resulting in a death, not for aggravated rape]; District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008). In the words of the Supreme Court, the courts must enforce those constitutional rights even when they have ""controversial public safety implications."" McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3045 (2010) (controlling opinion of Alito, J.).

Judge Kavanaugh's text, history, and tradition methodology for Second Amendment cases will not please people who believe that all gun control is impermissible, nor will it please advocates who want to make the Second Amendment a second-class right.",www.reason.com,right,f3NWebogM5MmF0Tq

""There will be plenty of time to take a look at their recommendations once they come forward,"" McConnell said of Biden's upcoming proposals during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""

Obama aides say the president still plans to act quickly on Biden's proposals.

""I believe most Americans would disagree with the idea that in the wake of what happened in Newtown, Conn., that we should put off any action on the issue of gun violence,"" Carney said Monday in response to McConnell's comments.

Biden's recommendations are likely to include proposals for legislation, as well as executive action Obama can sign into law without lawmakers' approval.

The president already has called on Congress to reinstate a ban on military-style assault weapons, close loopholes that allow gun buyers to skirt background checks and restrict high-capacity magazines.

Pro-gun lawmakers on Capitol Hill have said any comprehensive effort to respond to the Newtown shooting must include more than just tighter gun control.

In addition to Biden's meetings this week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan will meet with parent and teacher groups, while Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will meet with mental health and disability advocates.

The White House said other meetings are also scheduled with community organizations, business owners and religious leaders.

Teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works – and the NRA has a long and proud history of teaching it.



Our “Eddie Eagle” children’s safety program has taught over 25 million young children that if they see a gun, they should do four things: “Stop. Don’t touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult.” As a result of this and other private sector programs, fatal firearm accidents are at the lowest levels in more than 100 years.[1]



The NRA has over 80,000 certified instructors who teach our military personnel, law enforcement officers and hundreds of thousands of other American men and women how to safely use firearms. We do more – and spend more – than anyone else on teaching safe and responsible gun ownership.



We joined the nation in sorrow over the tragedy that occurred in Newtown, Connecticut. There is nothing more precious than our children. We have no more sacred duty than to protect our children and keep them safe. That’s why we asked former Congressman and Undersecretary of Homeland Security, Asa Hutchison, to bring in every expert available to develop a model School Shield Program – one that can be individually tailored to make our schools as safe as possible.



It’s time to throw an immediate blanket of security around our children. About a third of our schools have armed security already – because it works.[2] And that number is growing. Right now, state officials, local authorities and school districts in all 50 states are considering their own plans to protect children in their schools.



In addition, we need to enforce the thousands of gun laws that are currently on the books. Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works.

Trotter also released a statement ahead of today's hearing.

We all want a safer society, but we differ on how to accomplish that. Some proposals, however appealing they may seem, not only will fail to make us safer but will harm women most. Guns increase women's safety because over 90% of violent crimes occur without a firearm. As a result, guns reverse the balance of power in violent confrontations where women face criminals trying to misuse their size and physical strength. We must address gun violence not with high-minded, empty gestures based on emotional appeal but, instead, with clear-headed, meaningful steps based on facts and logic. For women, the ability to use firearms for lawful self-defense – a central component of our individual right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment – is far more significant than for men because guns are the great equalizer in a violent confrontation. Every woman deserves a fighting chance.

Kelly is expected to berate Congress for ""doing nothing"" to curb gun violence since Rep. Giffords was shot by madman Jared Loughner in January 2009.

The White House has identified 19 executive actions for President Barack Obama to move unilaterally on gun control, Vice President Joe Biden told a group of House Democrats on Monday, the administration’s first definitive statements about its response to last month’s mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.



Later this week, Obama will formally announce his proposals to reduce gun violence, which are expected to include renewal of the assault weapons ban, universal background checks and prohibition of high-capacity magazine clips. But Biden, who has been leading Obama’s task force on the response, spent two hours briefing a small group of sympathetic House Democrats on the road ahead in the latest White House outreach to invested groups.



The focus on executive orders is the result of the White House and other Democrats acknowledging the political difficulty of enacting any new gun legislation, a topic Biden did not address in Monday’s meeting.



The executive actions could include giving the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authority to conduct national research on guns, more aggressive enforcement of existing gun laws and pushing for wider sharing of existing gun databases among federal and state agencies, members of Congress in the meeting said.

Ironically, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will stand by Obama during his announcement Tuesday and has been giving him advice to the President on how to proceeed with gun control measures from the Oval Office and through Congress. The Windy City has already seen 18 murders in 2013 despite the city having the country's strictest gun control laws. More Americans are killed in Chicago each year than in Afghanistan.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said there are ways the administration can improve its chances of passing legislation this year.



Emanuel — who served in Congress from 2003 to 2009, including a stint as House Democratic Caucus chairman — helped secure passage of major gun control legislation as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton in 1994.

He awards Presidential Citizens Medals posthumously to educators killed in Newtown
The NRA opposes Obama 's gun plan as a step toward unconstitutional restrictions
An expert on urban crime says the president 's package would help
President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government , schools , family and clergy to have a chance to climb `` ladders of opportunity '' to reach the middle class and beyond .
Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live , Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work .
`` In too many neighborhoods today , whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America , it can feel like , for a lot of young people , the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town , '' he said , adding `` that no matter how much you work or how hard you try , your destiny was determined the moment you were born . ''
Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days , Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday 's State of the Union address , such as raising the minimum wage to $ 9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves .
The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes , as well as mass killings in recent months at a school , a movie theater and even a place of worship .
According to the Centers of Disease Control , there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010 , and 7,220 of the victims -- 65 % -- were aged 15-34 . In addition , 6,151 -- or 56 % -- were African American , a demographic that comprises about 13 % of the total U.S. population .
`` This is not just a gun issue , '' he continued . `` It 's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we 're building , and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it . ''
It all starts at home , the president said , calling `` strong , stable families '' and `` loving , supportive parents '' the most important ingredients for reducing violence .
Noting he was raised by a single mother , he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood , saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy .
`` By the way , that 's all kinds of parents , '' he added , drawing applause when he specified `` it includes gay or straight parents . ''
He acknowledged the challenge , saying `` it will not be easy , but it can be done . ''
`` No solution we offer will be perfect , '' he said . `` But perfection has never been our goal . Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can . ''

To Pollack , such a mass killing -- while relatively rare -- `` traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention . ''

Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday , saying `` it 's very hard to develop economically if people do n't feel safe . ''
In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings , the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school , rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons . It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws , which Pollack agreed was necessary .

In a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday , a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns .
He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases . Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called `` weapons of war . ''
`` It 's not going to solve every problem , '' the president continued , noting that some restrictions are already in place .
`` We ca n't purchase a grenade launcher from a store , although there may be some folks who want to buy those , '' he said . `` And the reason is we think on balance , the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that 's available you can automatically purchase .

The NRA opposes Obama's gun plan as a step toward unconstitutional restrictions

An expert on urban crime says the president's package would help

President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to climb ""ladders of opportunity"" to reach the middle class and beyond.

Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live, Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.

""In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town,"" he said, adding ""that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born.""

Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday's State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.

The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship.

According to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims -- 65% -- were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 -- or 56% -- were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.

""This is not just a gun issue,"" he continued. ""It's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.""

It all starts at home, the president said, calling ""strong, stable families"" and ""loving, supportive parents"" the most important ingredients for reducing violence.

Noting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.

""By the way, that's all kinds of parents,"" he added, drawing applause when he specified ""it includes gay or straight parents.""

He acknowledged the challenge, saying ""it will not be easy, but it can be done.""

""No solution we offer will be perfect,"" he said. ""But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can.""

Thousands who opposed to the bill were ignored. O'Malley was vocal in his support for the laws and made it a point to stress that the new laws would reduce crime and keep Maryland safe.

Fast forward to June and we've seen the violence in Maryland continue. It is important to note that before O'Malley signed new gun control laws in May, Maryland already had some of the strictest gun laws in the country and also some of the worst violence in its big cities. Baltimore was bad and now, it's getting worse.



So here's how Baltimore's 10 days of gun violence from hell went: About 40 people shot, 16 of them fatally.



Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts has decried the violence, as has Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Several members of the Baltimore City Council have also weighed in. But, so far, there's been nothing but silence from the one group of politicians Baltimore citizens need to hear from.



That would be Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who was mayor of Baltimore before he was elected governor. And it would be nice to hear from members of Baltimore's delegation to the state Legislature.



You know, the ones with nary a Republican in their ranks. The ones that voted, during the last legislative session, to pass a bill banning assault weapons and another bill that requires any law-abiding citizen that wants to buy a firearm in Maryland to be fingerprinted.

New laws require that anyone who wants to buy a firearm must be finger printed. Maryland turned law abiding citizens who simply want to exercise their Second Amendment rights, into crime suspects before they had done anything wrong. But guess what? That didn't work to reduce crime, either.

Thousands of other Marylanders - thought that fingerprinting was something done after a person has been arrested and booked for a crime. Or as a requirement for a job that has a high security clearance.



Maryland's Democratic legislators - and the state's governor - decided to change all that. For them, anyone desiring to buy a firearm automatically became a criminal suspect, a public menace worthy of being fingerprinted.



If it wasn't clear before, it's clear now: Maryland Democrats' greatest fear is a law-abiding citizen armed with a handgun or a rifle.



Violent miscreants with long criminal histories - like the ones currently causing the mayhem on Baltimore's streets, according to various police spokespersons - concern Maryland Democrats not at all.



During the most recent session of the state Legislature, Maryland Democrats focused on two problems that didn't exist. The ban on assault weapons has decreased gun violence in Baltimore not one iota.



That's because few, if any, of the shootings were done with assault weapons.



And the fingerprinting requirement affected only law-abiding citizens that want to buy firearms. It had no impact on Baltimore's criminal element at all.



Not surprisingly, O'Malley doesn't have much to say now that the ongoing violence in his state isn't politically convenient. Here's a reality check:

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/obama-bloomberg-gun-control-agenda-worries-democra/,Obama-Bloomberg gun control agenda worries Democrats heading into 2016,2015-04-09,Seth Mclaughlin,"NASHVILLE , Tenn. — President Obama said this week that he hasn ’ t given up on pushing for tighter gun controls , but many of his fellow Democrats in Congress are wishing he would drop it , having concluded that the issue is an electoral loser for them . If anything , they fear the politics are getting worse .
The politics of gun rights and gun control is a hot topic on the first full day of the National Rifle Association ’ s three-day annual meeting , in particular the political peril involved in attacking the right to bear arms .
“ Every time a Democrat starts talking about guns , they lose numbers because it is the Second Amendment , ” said Dave “ Mudcat ” Saunders , a Democratic strategist and lifelong gun owner . “ How many gun owners are there in America now ? Look it up . There is a bunch of them , and anytime you start talking about guns , you are going to take from your numbers . So there is just less talk [ about gun control ] now than there has been in forever . ”
They may not have a choice . Gun control groups , powered by potentially tens of millions of dollars from former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , vow to press the issue and force candidates to take a stand .
Indeed , the Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety is holding an event on the sidelines of the NRA gathering at the Music City Center , with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and hundreds of gun safety advocates .
“ We have been taking the fight for safer and more responsible gun laws to statehouses to Washington and corporations around the country , and that is why we are in Nashville this year , to call attention to how the NRA has been pushing dangerous legislation that hinders public safety in a number of states across the country , and we have been fighting them with some success for the first time in a long time , ” said Erika Soto Lamb , a spokeswoman for the group .
The gun control advocates will clearly be on the outside looking in on the NRA gathering , which is attracting tens of thousands of gun enthusiasts . It also is drawing most of the emerging field of likely Republican presidential hopefuls — including former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin , and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas — who are expected to pledge their fidelity to the Second Amendment and to gun owners nationwide .
NRA leaders already have begun talking with key financiers about doubling the financial resources they applied last year when they won several key races that helped tilt the Senate to Republican control , possibly having as much as $ 60 million to $ 70 million to fight a candidate like Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The near unity among Republicans on gun rights contrasts with the Democratic divide on the issue , underscoring how the politics appear to have swung in the GOP ’ s favor .
“ It is a loser for the Democrats and so they shy away from it — except in Washington , D.C. , or New York , where they have a strong liberal constituency and where it is not going to cost them votingwise , ” said Robert A . Levy , of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute .
Democrats pushed gun control legislation after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , that left 20 students and six educators dead and ignited a national debate over gun ownership .
Mr. Obama pledged to use “ all the powers of this office ” to champion more restrictive polices . He also called on lawmakers to limit ammunition and semi-automatic firearms sales , and to expand background checks .
Lawmakers rejected Mr. Obama ’ s demands and shot down a bipartisan push from Sens . Joe Manchin III , West Virginia Democrat , and Patrick J. Toomey , Pennsylvania Republican , to expand background checks to gun shows and online sales .
Roughly two years later , there is little indication that serious gun control legislation can pass — in particular after Republicans seized control of the Senate in the November elections .
Public opinion also has shifted . The Pew Research Center released a poll in December that found for the first time in two-plus decades of Pew surveys that there was more support for gun rights than gun control .
“ The power of NRA and the gun lobby in Congress is formidable , ” Mr. Obama told ABC News this week . “ And you know , we ’ re going to keep chipping away at this , but until you get intense public demands for this , it ’ s probably not going to happen because some special interests and lobbyists in Washington are really , really strong and their membership feels very intensely about the issue . Whereas the general public is concerned about it , but doesn ’ t make it their top priority . ”
Andrew Arulanandam , a spokesman for the NRA , said the credit goes to NRA members and their allies .
“ They are a powerful voting bloc , ” Mr. Arulanandam said . “ They know there are a lot of powerful folks and wealthy folks who want to destroy the Second Amendment . ”
The battle over gun rights has heated up at the state level , where the Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety is fighting for stricter background checks at gun shows and against efforts to allow concealed weapons in schools .
“ We are not taking our eye off of Washington , but there is a lot of activity happening in the states and I think for the first time in a long time the NRA is facing the real people of those states who are coming out and opposing legislation that forces guns into schools and parks and actually scales back public safety measures , ” Ms. Lamb said .
Mike McKenna , a Republican Party strategist , said Mr. Bloomberg has “ no credibility ” on the issue in the eyes of gun rights advocates and that the last thing Democrats want is to pick a fight over guns . “ Because when they do , the people on the other side go nuts , ” he said .
He also said Democrats are afraid of the issue because they are not comfortable talking about it .
“ The truth of the matter is the idea of a Democrat , as constructed by Hollywood , is that they are these blue-collar guys from the middle of the country , who are union guys , own guns and go hunting , ” he said . “ That is a beautiful story . But for the most part , those guys are dead , ” Mr. McKenna said .
Mr. Saunders , meanwhile , said the divide over guns is “ geographical and cultural . ”
“ If you get my part of the world , the southern Appalachian Mountains and west Texas and places like this , guns are just part of our culture , ” he said . “ I talk to friends who live in urban environments , and they are good people and their culture says guns are a bad thing . It is because their culture is different than mine . ”
Mr. Saunders added , “ I was born with a gun and I will die with a gun . ”","NASHVILLE, Tenn. — President Obama said this week that he hasn’t given up on pushing for tighter gun controls, but many of his fellow Democrats in Congress are wishing he would drop it, having concluded that the issue is an electoral loser for them.

“The power of NRA and the gun lobby in Congress is formidable,” Mr. Obama told ABC News this week. “And you know, we’re going to keep chipping away at this, but until you get intense public demands for this, it’s probably not going to happen because some special interests and lobbyists in Washington are really, really strong and their membership feels very intensely about the issue. Whereas the general public is concerned about it, but doesn’t make it their top priority.”

Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, said the credit goes to NRA members and their allies.

“They are a powerful voting bloc,” Mr. Arulanandam said. “They know there are a lot of powerful folks and wealthy folks who want to destroy the Second Amendment.”

The battle over gun rights has heated up at the state level, where the Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety is fighting for stricter background checks at gun shows and against efforts to allow concealed weapons in schools.

“We are not taking our eye off of Washington, but there is a lot of activity happening in the states and I think for the first time in a long time the NRA is facing the real people of those states who are coming out and opposing legislation that forces guns into schools and parks and actually scales back public safety measures,” Ms. Lamb said.

Mike McKenna, a Republican Party strategist, said Mr. Bloomberg has “no credibility” on the issue in the eyes of gun rights advocates and that the last thing Democrats want is to pick a fight over guns. “Because when they do, the people on the other side go nuts,” he said.

He also said Democrats are afraid of the issue because they are not comfortable talking about it.

“The truth of the matter is the idea of a Democrat, as constructed by Hollywood, is that they are these blue-collar guys from the middle of the country, who are union guys, own guns and go hunting,” he said. “That is a beautiful story. But for the most part, those guys are dead,” Mr. McKenna said.

Mr. Saunders, meanwhile, said the divide over guns is “geographical and cultural.”

“If you get my part of the world, the southern Appalachian Mountains and west Texas and places like this, guns are just part of our culture,” he said. “I talk to friends who live in urban environments, and they are good people and their culture says guns are a bad thing. It is because their culture is different than mine.”

Mr. Saunders added, “I was born with a gun and I will die with a gun.”

The directives on gun violence President Obama signed Wednesday were meant to seem harmless. A closer look at the president’s first memorandum reveals it to be a sneaky assault on congressional authority in order to fund gun-control propaganda.

Getting this done has been on the White House “to do” list for some time. In his 2013 budget submission, Mr. Obama deleted the prohibition that has been in effect since 1995 on the use of federal funds to advocate or promote gun control.

Mr. Obama is trying to steamroll the Democratic and Republican majorities that kept the ban intact by labeling the advocacy as research. “While year after year, those who oppose even modest gun-safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it,” said Mr. Obama.

Under the terms of the memo, CDC may “sponsor” another entity to conduct the research, which is a handy way of funneling taxpayer cash to sympathetic gun-control groups.

Earlier this week, anti-gun activists, including New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, spent a lot of time at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore discussing how the government-spending prohibition was hampering their plans.

Daniel Webster, director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at the school, backed the president’s plan. “I agree that the CDC should be free to fund high-quality research into the causes and solutions to gun violence, one of the leading causes of premature mortality in the U.S. that affects not only deaths and injuries, but mental health as well,” he told The Washington Times.

Congress clamped down on the spending after President Clinton used the CDC and National Institutes of Health to create material advancing his theme of treating gun ownership as a public health issue, rather than a constitutional right. Millions in taxpayer funds were blown on junk science, such as $2.6 million used to determine if teenagers who are shot are more likely to have been drinking and carrying a gun. An additional $2 million went to figure out whether moving bars and liquor stores would prevent gun violence in communities.

By calling gun violence a “public health crisis” on Wednesday, Mr. Obama echoed Mr. Clinton’s model.

The NRA is keeping the pressure on Republicans to hold the line. In an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, the group's vice president and chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, called the Democratic push for new gun restrictions an intentional distraction.

Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like “trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex,” LaPierre said. “And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.”",www.politico.com,left,KiSwFtWvNWWmRpmV

-- President Obama addressing donors to his permanent campaign group on Wednesday.

Taking umbrage at Ted Cruz has become a very “in” thing to do in Washington.

The junior senator from Texas has gotten the warm reception of a skunk at a garden party since taking office at the beginning of the year.

The latest umbrage Olympiad was the Thursday hearing on a gun ban bill before it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. Cruz asked Sen. Diane Feinstein, the California Democrat and sponsor of the bill that mirrors 1994 legislation she also championed, if she thought other constitutional rights could be similarly infringed.

If the federal government could ban certain weapons, he asked, could it also ban certain books? Or could the federal government exclude certain people from Fourth Amendment search and seizure protections? His point was that the language in those other amendments was the same as the language in the second amendment.

More On This...

Feinstein was flabbergasted at his lack of senatorial deference, scolding Cruz for “lecturing” her and talking about her knowledge of the deadly power of firearms. She did not answer the question but instead gave Cruz a dressing down.

Thus began a round robin of umbrage taking.

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois scoffed at Cruz’s original question, observing that the government restricts pornography. (Of course, it does seem unlikely that today’s Supreme Court would uphold a federal law that identified specific publications or subjects--save those involving children).

Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, jumped in next, mocking Cruz’s home state for restrictive school reading lists, saying that such prudishness was something they would never do in his home state of Vermont. That’s not the same as the government banning books, but it does reinforce blue-state self-satisfaction about social permissiveness and general loathing of Texas.

After a good round of harrumphing, the committee moved on to pass the doomed legislation. Without the support of red-state Democrats and a few Republicans the bill will not pass, but Leahy, Durbin and Feinstein could know that they had stood on principle and denounced Cruz in the process.

Cruz gets some umbrage from his own party, notably Sen. John McCain who called him a “wacko bird.” But Cruz, being Hispanic, gets extra protection from the old guard in Washington since the leaders of his party are in a desperate dash for demographic outreach. Add to the fact that Cruz is already very popular with the GOP base, and you see how Cruz gets protected status in the GOP.

But for Democrats, he is probably target number one in Congress today. Yes it’s because he refuses to act like a back bencher, but it’s also for the issues on which he’s making his stands, especially guns.

Gun control is part of the big three issues for liberals today, the others being global warming and same-sex relations. With primary season 2014 and an open 2016 nominating process just around the corner, Democrats are eager to show that they care about the big three.

Vice President Joe Biden, perhaps the most accomplished gun control advocate in his party, has been pushing hard on the issue. He published a flurry of tweets in support of the Feinstein legislation as it headed to the full Senate for a ceremonial sinking. Biden has taken up the task of seeking a gun ban with real zeal.

[pullquote]

This is a matter of conviction for Biden, no doubt, but like other gun ban backers, it’s also good primary politics. Possible 2016 contenders Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado have all gotten behind state-level gun bans. New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, a possible presidential contender of some kind, is pushing his personal fortune behind primary challenges to pro-gun Democrats.

But the president himself, now beyond the grasp of primary voters, has been more muted on the subject of late. His permanent campaign organization lists gun control as a top concern, but the president has other business to attend to right now.

Feinstein has lamented a lack of presidential leadership on the subject and other liberals are starting to wonder whether Obama will do what Bill Clinton did 20 years ago and start spending his own political capital to get the controversial measure through Congress.

Obama’s implicit promise is that he can use his own well-funded special interest group to counter the other well-funded special interest groups pushing Congress to help deliver a gun ban, but not today.

Today, Obama is trying to break out of a politically damaging cycle of budget battles. The new wisdom in Obamaland seems to be that the president needs a spending and borrowing deal that will carry the federal government through the 2014 election cycle.

That means getting Democrats to yield on entitlement programs in an effort to entice Republicans into raising taxes again. Based on the two budget blueprints put forward in Congress this week, there’s a long way to go. And while Republicans remain open to tax changes if not increases, Democrats are fully shunning the question of entitlements.

So here is Obama, at last talking to Republicans, and there are Democrats, digging in their heels on entitlements and ramping up the pressure on gun control.

The president can achieve many liberal aims on global warming by jackhammering carbon-centric industries through the EPA. He is already doing his best on gay things, including a reversal of his previous position that states could ban same-sex marriage as seen in his administration’s effort to reverse California’s ban.

But guns are big right now and ambitious Democrats, including the vice president, are not going to be silent on the subject. It would help the president to get a budget deal before turning to social issues like guns and immigration.

But if Biden, Bloomberg, Feinstein and others keep shoving guns forward it will divide Democrats at a moment of much-needed unity. Obama’s promise of total victory after 2014 may not sound appealing to those on the left who have long been disappointed by Obama’s willingness to fight for their causes. If the president wants to try entitlement changes before he seeks a gun ban, those old fears will be quickly rekindled, burning up the needed capital on the left to get changes to Medicare, etc.

But if Obama were to get back in front of the gun ban movement, he won’t find as many moderate Democrats willing to stand with him on a budget deal.

Such is life of a lame duck. You’re trying to live for the moment while your party is living for the next election.

But whether the moves will translate into fewer guns on the street remains an open question .
The announcement Tuesday follows similar steps by other retailers responding to public pressure to restrict gun and ammunition sales . In March , Dick 's Sporting Goods said it would stop selling firearms and ammunition at 125 of its 700-plus locations . Meanwhile , Starbucks , Target , Wendy 's and most recently Kroger have also asked customers not to openly carry guns when visiting their stores .
Supporters of stricter gun laws say that as the nation 's largest retailer , Walmart will have outsized influence on the gun debate , sending a strong message to Congress as well as other corporations to also take action .

Over the last 15 years , Walmart had expanded beyond its hunting and fishing roots , carrying items like assault rifles in response to increasing demand . But particularly since 2015 , often coinciding with major public mass shootings , the company has made moves to curb the sale of ammunition and guns .
Walmart announced in February 2018 that it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and also removed items resembling assault-style rifles from its website . Those moves were prompted by the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland , Florida , that killed 17 people .
In 2015 , Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 style rifle , the type used in the Dayton shooting . The retailer also does n't sell large-capacity magazines . Dick 's Sporting Good stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2018 .","Walmart has won praise from gun control advocates for its decision to discontinue sales of certain gun ammunition and request that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores. But whether the moves will translate into fewer guns on the street remains an open question.

The announcement Tuesday follows similar steps by other retailers responding to public pressure to restrict gun and ammunition sales. In March, Dick's Sporting Goods said it would stop selling firearms and ammunition at 125 of its 700-plus locations. Meanwhile, Starbucks, Target, Wendy's and most recently Kroger have also asked customers not to openly carry guns when visiting their stores.

Supporters of stricter gun laws say that as the nation's largest retailer, Walmart will have outsized influence on the gun debate, sending a strong message to Congress as well as other corporations to also take action.

""Walmart deserves enormous credit for joining the strong and growing majority of Americans who know that we have too many guns in our country and they are too easy to get,"" said Igor Volsky, executive director and founder of Guns Down America, in a statement. ""That work doesn't end with Walmart's decision today. As Congress comes back to consider gun violence, Walmart should make it clear that it stands with Americans who are demanding real change.""

Holder Jr. to establish a firearms buy-back grant program .
Since the Newtown , Conn. , school-shootings tragedy , anti-gun states across the nation have introduced similar measures .
A new bill in the House would prevent this infringement on the Second Amendment . Rep. Sam Graves introduced legislation on June 13 that would make it illegal for states and municipalities to raise taxes or fees on firearms and ammunition . The Missouri Republican ’ s proposal would also prevent raising taxes in order to pay for background checks . “ The Constitution says ‘ shall not infringe , ’ ” Mr. Graves told me in an interview Thursday .
“ When you place this outrageous tax on the sale of ammunition and firearms , it ’ s intended to curtail those rights. ” Congress has authority to do this under Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce , which these taxes suppress .
The National Shooting Sports Foundation , which represents the manufacturers , and the National Rifle Association both endorsed the Graves bill , which will go through the House Judiciary Committee .
Massachusetts is considering a 25 percent excise tax on all firearms , ammunition and parts as part of its overall gun-control agenda . The Nevada Assembly is moving on a bill to impose a $ 25 tax on each gun and 2 cents for each round of ammunition sold by a dealer .
Connecticut legislators proposed this year a 50-cent sales tax on ammunition . Washington state is considering a proposal to tax every firearm sold at retail at $ 25 ( lowered to $ 15 if the buyer springs for a gun safe or gun lock ) and 1 cent on each round of ammunition .
The states with the most radical proposals are Maryland and Connecticut , both of which are proposing raising taxes on ammunition by 50 percent . Alcohol , which is not guaranteed by the Constitution but leads to more deaths than firearms , is the only other item in the Free State that is taxed higher than the 6 percent sales tax , but it is only 9 percent .
Several other states are also going after bullets because they are purchased more often than guns . A bill introduced in New Jersey proposes a 7 percent levy on ammunition sales . The California Assembly is considering a bill to impose a 5-cent-per-round levy on retailers for “ the privilege of selling ammunition . ”
These costly measures disproportionately affect lower-income people , who often live in higher-crime areas . Along with other costly mandates , such as maintaining liability insurance , these restrictions would likely be overturned as unconstitutional by the courts .
“ This is no different than a poll tax — but on the Second Amendment , ” said Lawrence Keane , general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation . “ These anti-gun politicians are clearly trying to unduly burden the exercise of the Second Amendment by pricing firearms and ammunition out of reach of many law-abiding Americans .

Meanwhile , Mr. Graves correctly points out that the gun grabbers ’ efforts have backfired so far . “ The Obama administration has tried to capitalize on some unfortunate instances to try to slow down the sale of firearms and ammo .
The irony is that the pressure to outlaw or control the sale of firearms , it just accelerates sales . It ’ s like pouring gas on a fire. ” The number of FBI background checks were up 27 percent in March , leading to the Senate vote the next month on Mr. Obama ’ s gun-control agenda . The national instant criminal-background checks were up 20 percent in April .
Liberals love to raise taxes to push their social agenda , whether to push us out of our cars , stop us from smoking , force us to eat low-fat foods or curtail our drinking of alcohol .
In their worldview , individuals are not capable of being responsible for their own health and well-being , so they need the nanny state to enforce proper behavior via their pocketbooks . However , unlike cigarettes and martinis , guns are guaranteed by the Bill of Rights .
The House should pass the Graves bill quickly to show the states that their gun-grabbing scam will misfire .

Liberals are trying every tool at their disposal this year to go after guns. They have failed on Capitol Hill to restrict the Second Amendment, so they are moving through the states to enact their agenda.

The latest maneuver is to hike the tax on guns and ammunition to dissuade the law-abiding from buying firearms. It’s the perfect storm of liberalism — more revenue for a bigger government and fewer people keeping and bearing arms.

President Obama’s hometown of Chicago started the movement late last year by enacting a $25 tax on new firearm purchases, which went into effect on April 1. Cook County stopped just short of adding a levy on ammunition.

In February, Rep. Linda T. Sanchez, California Democrat, and 26 of the most uber-liberals in the House introduced a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to create an excise tax of 10 percent on any concealable gun in order to empower Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to establish a firearms buy-back grant program.

Since the Newtown, Conn., school-shootings tragedy, anti-gun states across the nation have introduced similar measures.

A new bill in the House would prevent this infringement on the Second Amendment. Rep. Sam Graves introduced legislation on June 13 that would make it illegal for states and municipalities to raise taxes or fees on firearms and ammunition. The Missouri Republican’s proposal would also prevent raising taxes in order to pay for background checks. “The Constitution says ‘shall not infringe,’ ” Mr. Graves told me in an interview Thursday.

“When you place this outrageous tax on the sale of ammunition and firearms, it’s intended to curtail those rights.” Congress has authority to do this under Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce, which these taxes suppress.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the manufacturers, and the National Rifle Association both endorsed the Graves bill, which will go through the House Judiciary Committee.

Massachusetts is considering a 25 percent excise tax on all firearms, ammunition and parts as part of its overall gun-control agenda. The Nevada Assembly is moving on a bill to impose a $25 tax on each gun and 2 cents for each round of ammunition sold by a dealer.

Connecticut legislators proposed this year a 50-cent sales tax on ammunition. Washington state is considering a proposal to tax every firearm sold at retail at $25 (lowered to $15 if the buyer springs for a gun safe or gun lock) and 1 cent on each round of ammunition.

The states with the most radical proposals are Maryland and Connecticut, both of which are proposing raising taxes on ammunition by 50 percent. Alcohol, which is not guaranteed by the Constitution but leads to more deaths than firearms, is the only other item in the Free State that is taxed higher than the 6 percent sales tax, but it is only 9 percent.

Several other states are also going after bullets because they are purchased more often than guns. A bill introduced in New Jersey proposes a 7 percent levy on ammunition sales. The California Assembly is considering a bill to impose a 5-cent-per-round levy on retailers for “the privilege of selling ammunition.”

These costly measures disproportionately affect lower-income people, who often live in higher-crime areas. Along with other costly mandates, such as maintaining liability insurance, these restrictions would likely be overturned as unconstitutional by the courts.

“This is no different than a poll tax — but on the Second Amendment,” said Lawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. “These anti-gun politicians are clearly trying to unduly burden the exercise of the Second Amendment by pricing firearms and ammunition out of reach of many law-abiding Americans. Mr. Graves‘ bill will put a stop to these sinister schemes.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Graves correctly points out that the gun grabbers’ efforts have backfired so far. “The Obama administration has tried to capitalize on some unfortunate instances to try to slow down the sale of firearms and ammo.

The irony is that the pressure to outlaw or control the sale of firearms, it just accelerates sales. It’s like pouring gas on a fire.” The number of FBI background checks were up 27 percent in March, leading to the Senate vote the next month on Mr. Obama’s gun-control agenda. The national instant criminal-background checks were up 20 percent in April.

Liberals love to raise taxes to push their social agenda, whether to push us out of our cars, stop us from smoking, force us to eat low-fat foods or curtail our drinking of alcohol.

In their worldview, individuals are not capable of being responsible for their own health and well-being, so they need the nanny state to enforce proper behavior via their pocketbooks. However, unlike cigarettes and martinis, guns are guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.

The House should pass the Graves bill quickly to show the states that their gun-grabbing scam will misfire.

Many gun control advocates have suggested immediately used it to call for new gun legislation.

President Obama has not yet specifically advocated new legislation to curb gun violence. But speaking in Connecticut Sunday night, he told the grieving families of Sandy Brook Elementary School. The president asked if the nation can say it is doing enough to protect its children.

""If we're honest with ourselves the answer is no,"" he answered. ""We've not been doing enough. And we will have to change.""

Obama has not made gun legislation a priority of his administration, although he supports renewing the assault weapons ban, which was in effect from 1994 until 2004.

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/8/giffords-kelly-launch-gun-control-initiative/,"Giffords, Kelly launch gun control lobbying effort",2013-01-08,"Bob Christie, Brian Skoloff","TUCSON , Ariz. — Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband launched a political action committee aimed at curbing gun violence on Tuesday as her Arizona hometown paused to mark the second anniversary of a deadly shooting rampage that left her with severe injuries .
Tucson residents rang bells at 10:11 a.m. — the moment a mentally ill gunman opened fire on Giffords as she met with constituents in 2011 , killing six people and leaving 12 others injured . Mayor Jonathan Rothschild rang a bell at a fire station 19 times — one for each victim .
At the same time , two politicians on opposite ends of the gun debate held dueling weapons buy-backs outside a police station . Such events have been held around the country since the shooting at a Connecticut school that revived the gun control debate .
City Councilman Steve Kozachik asked people to turn in their guns for a $ 50 gift certificate from Safeway — the grocery store chain that owned the supermarket that was the site of the shooting . He wants to get guns out of people ’ s home and bring pressure on politicians to change gun laws .
In response to the event , a Republican outgoing state senator gathered outside the same station and offered cash for guns . Several people waved signs and held up money to approaching drivers to announce that they will buy their guns .
Giffords also took a prominent role in the gun debate on the anniversary . She and husband Mark Kelly , a former astronaut , wrote in an op-ed published in USA Today that their Americans for Responsible Solutions initiative would help raise money to support greater gun control efforts .
“ Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources , ” the couple wrote in the column . They said that it will “ raise funds necessary to balance the influence of the gun lobby . ”
The move was hinted at in Kelly ’ s recent comments that he and Giffords want to become a prominent voice for gun control efforts .
The couple last week visited Newtown , Conn. , where a gunman opened fire in an elementary school , killing 20 children and six adults in December . They also met with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a billionaire who has spent some of his fortune in recent years on gun control efforts .
The couple was expected to discuss the initiative in an interview airing Tuesday on ABC News .
The network offered a preview of the interview Monday and during “ Good Morning America ” on Tuesday . Kelly described a meeting with a father of a Connecticut victim in which he “ just about lost it ” after the parent showed him a picture of his child .
When asked by Diane Sawyer about when such violence happens to school children , Giffords responded : “ Enough . ”
In the op-ed piece , Kelly and Giffords discussed what they deem lawmakers ’ inaction on curbing gun violence .
“ In response to a horrific series of shootings that has sown terror in our communities , victimized tens of thousands of Americans , and left one of its own bleeding and near death in a Tucson parking lot , Congress has done something quite extraordinary — nothing at all , ” Giffords and Kelly wrote in the op-ed .
“ This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems , big and small . Wise policy has conquered disease , protected us from dangerous products and substances , and made transportation safer . But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence , we ’ re not even trying — and for the worst of reasons . ”
They hope to start a national conversation about gun violence and raise funds for political activity , so “ legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby . ”

Gabrielle Giffords and her husband launched a political action committee aimed at curbing gun violence on Tuesday as her Arizona hometown paused to mark the second anniversary of a deadly shooting rampage that left her with severe injuries.

Tucson residents rang bells at 10:11 a.m. — the moment a mentally ill gunman opened fire on Giffords as she met with constituents in 2011, killing six people and leaving 12 others injured. Mayor Jonathan Rothschild rang a bell at a fire station 19 times — one for each victim.

At the same time, two politicians on opposite ends of the gun debate held dueling weapons buy-backs outside a police station. Such events have been held around the country since the shooting at a Connecticut school that revived the gun control debate.

City Councilman Steve Kozachik asked people to turn in their guns for a $50 gift certificate from Safeway — the grocery store chain that owned the supermarket that was the site of the shooting. He wants to get guns out of people’s home and bring pressure on politicians to change gun laws.

In response to the event, a Republican outgoing state senator gathered outside the same station and offered cash for guns. Several people waved signs and held up money to approaching drivers to announce that they will buy their guns.

Giffords also took a prominent role in the gun debate on the anniversary. She and husband Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, wrote in an op-ed published in USA Today that their Americans for Responsible Solutions initiative would help raise money to support greater gun control efforts.

“Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources,” the couple wrote in the column. They said that it will “raise funds necessary to balance the influence of the gun lobby.”

The move was hinted at in Kelly’s recent comments that he and Giffords want to become a prominent voice for gun control efforts.

The couple last week visited Newtown, Conn., where a gunman opened fire in an elementary school, killing 20 children and six adults in December. They also met with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who has spent some of his fortune in recent years on gun control efforts.

The couple was expected to discuss the initiative in an interview airing Tuesday on ABC News.

The network offered a preview of the interview Monday and during “Good Morning America” on Tuesday. Kelly described a meeting with a father of a Connecticut victim in which he “just about lost it” after the parent showed him a picture of his child.

When asked by Diane Sawyer about when such violence happens to school children, Giffords responded: “Enough.”

In the op-ed piece, Kelly and Giffords discussed what they deem lawmakers’ inaction on curbing gun violence.

“In response to a horrific series of shootings that has sown terror in our communities, victimized tens of thousands of Americans, and left one of its own bleeding and near death in a Tucson parking lot, Congress has done something quite extraordinary — nothing at all,” Giffords and Kelly wrote in the op-ed.

“This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small. Wise policy has conquered disease, protected us from dangerous products and substances, and made transportation safer. But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we’re not even trying — and for the worst of reasons.”

They hope to start a national conversation about gun violence and raise funds for political activity, so “legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby.”

As a House member, Giffords was a centrist Democrat who represented much of liberal-leaning Tucson but also more conservative, rural areas. She voiced support for gun rights and said she owned a Glock pistol. In the editorial, the couple mentioned they own two guns that are locked in a safe at their house.

At the gun events in Tucson, Kozachik said that as the shooting fades from the public’s mind, issues like controlling the sale of large-capacity magazines and keeping guns from the mentally ill need attention.

The National Rifle Association and 20 states are backing an appeal by five New York residents who claim that the state law violates their constitutional gun rights .

The bill was approved by the committee on a party-line , 10-8 vote . Chief sponsor , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she knows `` the road is uphill '' for the legislation , but sought to press her colleagues to consider the bill .
`` Are we going to stand with the thousands of police chiefs and law enforcement officers who do support this bill ? Are we going to stand with the victims of gun violence ? '' she said , stressing that the bill does not take `` any weapons away from anybody '' but would ban future purchases .
Republicans , though , described the legislation -- which comes nearly a decade after the last assault-weapons ban expired -- as an ineffective response to a genuine problem .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , noted that so-called assault weapons are used in a scant percentage of murders every year and said a ban would merely provide a `` false sense of safety . '' He critiqued another measure that would limit the size of magazines .
`` I could see a situation where an individual citizen would need more than six bullets , or 10 '' for self-defense , he said . `` There are so many better ways to deal with this . ''
The vote comes after the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced bills earlier in the week to enact near-universal background checks and combat gun trafficking . The measure approved Thursday is the most controversial drafted since the deadly Newtown , Conn. , school shooting .
But once it reaches the full Senate -- probably in April -- the measure faces heavy opposition by Republicans and some moderate Democrats , as well . Feinstein acknowledged she 'd need more backing if it is to stand a chance on the floor -- even then , it 's hard to imagine a circumstance where the Republican-controlled House would allow the measure to proceed .
`` I 'd like to see everybody doing more , '' bill sponsor Feinstein said Wednesday when asked if she 'd like more assistance from President Obama . `` Yes , absolutely , we need help . We have the 800-pound gorilla out there '' -- a reference to the potent National Rifle Association .
Obama made an assault weapons ban part of the gun curbs he proposed in January , a month after a shooter with an assault rifle killed 20 first-graders and six educators at a school in Newtown , Conn. Feinstein and others have argued that such firearms are used in a disproportionate number of mass shootings and should n't be available to civilians .
The prohibition has emerged as one of the most controversial of the gun restrictions being considered in Congress . Foes of barring the weapons say law-abiding citizens should not lose their Second Amendment right to own the weapons , which they say are popular for self-defense , hunting and collecting .
Feinstein 's bill would also ban large-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds , which she and her allies say allow shooters to inflict more casualties before pausing to reload , which is when they might be stopped . Adam Lanza , the Newtown gunman , was said to have had 30-round magazines .
The measure 's passage by the Judiciary panel has been a foregone conclusion for some time . It will be far more vulnerable in the full Senate , where Democrats are expected to need 60 votes for passage through the 100-member chamber . That is where the NRA and other pro-gun groups are working hard for the ban 's defeat .
`` We are focused on the next step of the legislative process , '' Chris W. Cox , the NRA 's chief lobbyist , said Wednesday .
There are 53 Democrats plus two independents who generally side with them . Republicans seem ready to oppose the ban overwhelmingly , and Feinstein ca n't count on a half-dozen Democrats from Republican-leaning states who face re-election next year .
The ban also stands little chance of approval in the GOP-controlled House .
Feinstein 's bill would ban semi-automatic weapons -- guns that fire one round and automatically reload -- that can take a detachable magazine and have at least one military feature like a pistol grip .
It specifically bans 157 named weapons . But in an effort to avoid antagonizing those who use them for sports , the measure allows 2,258 rifles and shotguns that are frequently used by hunters .
It also exempts any weapons that are lawfully owned whenever the bill is enacted .
Feinstein was a leader in passage of a 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . Congress failed to renew it when it expired in 2004 .
There are no definitive figures on assault weapons or high-capacity ammunition magazines in the U.S. , since there are no government registries of firearms and Congress has curbed federal research on guns since the late 1990s .

Opponents cite studies showing that assault weapons have been used in fewer than 1 in 10 crimes involving firearms and argue that eliminating those weapons would put only a minor dent in gun violence . High-capacity magazines are involved in up to a quarter of gun crimes .

Beyond their own policy changes, Dick’s will also be encouraging lawmakers to enact “common sense gun reform” including bans on assault weapons and bump stocks, raising the age limit to purchase a firearm, and broader universal background checks that include previous encounters with law enforcement and mental health information.

The changes come after Stack said the store discovered they had legally sold a firearm to the shooter in November, but it was not the one used in the high school massacre.

“But it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,’’ he said. “We said, ‘We don’t want to be a part of this any longer.’”

The company made changes after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, taking semi-automatic rifles out of main retail stores, but they starting carrying them again at their retail chain, Field & Stream.

The changes are permanent this time, however.

""We're staunch supporters of the second amendment, I'm a gun owner myself,"" Stack said on ""Good Morning America."" ""We don't want to be a part of this story and we have eliminated these guns permanently.""",www.townhall.com,right,QzJ20hJVsgDHOIaz

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/retired-jail-officers-sue-dc-for-right-to-carry-gu/,"Facing threats, retired officers forced to sue D.C. for right to carry guns",2014-12-18,Andrea Noble,"It ’ s been six years since Robert L. Smith retired from his job as a corrections officer at the D.C . Jail , but he says he still receives threats from former inmates he supervised .
He keeps a legally registered handgun inside his Southwest D.C. home , but he would like to be able to carry it to protect himself . As a former jail employee , he said , he should qualify for a permit under federal statutes that allow retired law enforcement officers to carry guns without obtaining state licenses .
But the D.C. Department of Corrections doesn ’ t see it that way , and the agency has declined to provide the required approvals for his request .
So Mr. Smith and three other retired employees have sued the District over the issue , wading into a debate playing out across the country over whether the federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act should be interpreted to allow those who staff the country ’ s jails and prisons to carry guns outside of work .
The act was signed into law in 2004 by President George W. Bush as a force multiplier , giving off-duty and retired law enforcement officers the ability to respond to situations requiring use of a firearm but also as a way for officers to protect themselves from vindictive criminals .
“ They remember you , ” Mr. Smith said of the thousands of inmates he supervised in the 25 years he worked for the Department of Corrections .

“ As soon as the police arrest somebody off the street , they don ’ t have to see them no more except maybe in court , ” said Mr. Smith , who now works security for a federal agency . “ We ’ ve got to supervise them . We ’ ve got to feed them . We ’ ve got to take them to the parole board . ”
That ’ s why Mr. Smith questions whether a group of men who opened fire on him in 2012 in the alley behind his home might have been former inmates .
“ I was emptying the trash one day , and next thing I know four guys had firearms down the alley . And they started shooting , and I could actually feel the bullets real close to me , ” he said .
The fear of retaliation is the same reason Mr. Smith doesn ’ t like to talk about his former job with strangers . He never knows whether someone he doesn ’ t remember might remember him .
He has applied for a concealed carry permit under a new set of regulations approved by the D.C. Council , but it ’ s unclear whether he will qualify under the strict rules that require a person to show a specific need .
D.C . Jail officials have refused to sign off on paperwork that would certify Mr. Smith and his co-plaintiffs — Ronald DuBerry , Harold Bennette and Maurice Curtis — as retired law enforcement officers , making them ineligible to carry firearms under the federal act .
“ In spite of their years of service that would qualify them to have a firearms permit under LEOSA , the District of Columbia is improperly asserting that these individuals never qualified as law enforcement officers with arrest authority , ” attorneys William J. Phelan and F. Peter Silva II wrote in the lawsuit filed this summer in U.S. District Court for the District .
In conversation , attorney Chris Gowen , who is also working on the case , puts it more bluntly .
Until this summer , when D.C. laws banning the carrying of handguns were overturned by a U.S. District Court judge , a federal permit was one of the few ways a D.C. resident could qualify to carry a firearm in the city .
Police officers , federal law enforcement officials , sheriff ’ s deputies and even Amtrak police can qualify under the federal law as long as they meet other criteria , such as retiring in good standing and keeping up firearms qualifications .
The first step to getting the federal certification is having a former employer sign paperwork to certify law enforcement experience .
But when human resource officials at the city ’ s jail received the request , officials checked a box indicating that the corrections officers did not have “ statutory powers of arrest , ” an automatic disqualifier for those seeking to carry under the federal statute .
The city takes the position that D.C. laws “ do not in fact accord corrections officers with law enforcement status and arrest authority , ” corrections spokeswoman Sylvia Lane said in an email response to questions .
She said corrections director Tom Faust “ will not certify an application request for carrying a concealed weapon under LEOSA for retired employees , as corrections officers do not meet all of the required elements necessary . ”
The National Fraternal Order of Police , which lobbied for the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act , takes issue with the response , believing the law was meant to include corrections officers . But given the wide latitude in the authority and responsibilities of those who oversee local and state jails , jurisdictions have differed in practice .
“ The authority of corrections officers vary widely , ” said Jim Pasco , executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police legislative center . “ Some have arrest authority , and some do not . ”
In Maryland , state corrections employees must have “ full police powers ” to be eligible , said Mark A. Vernarelli , a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services .
“ Among correctional and Parole and Probation personnel , this might limit the eligibility to those such as detectives and Warrant Unit officers with 10 years of service and full police powers , ” Mr. Vernarelli said .
Corrections officers at the Prince George ’ s County Department of Corrections also do not have powers of arrest and would not qualify , but department spokeswoman Yolanda Evans said the agency lets the state make the decision by offering letters to any retired employee who asks that they certify the number of years an employee worked there and whether or not they left in good standing .
Other corrections facilities , such as the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center , are run by sheriff ’ s deputies , who are considered to have full police powers and would qualify under the federal law .
Brian Dawe , director of the nonprofit American Correctional Officer , said he thinks departments are worried about liability issues .
“ When it comes to this particular benefit , they don ’ t want to give it out , ” Mr. Dawe said .
The federal law stipulates that among the requirements for a government employee to be a qualified law enforcement officer , he or she must be “ authorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention , detection , investigation , or prosecution of , or the incarceration of any person for , any violation of law , and has statutory powers of arrest ” and “ authorized by the agency to carry a firearm . ”
But Sgt . John Rosser , chairman of the District ’ s Fraternal Order of Police labor unit representing corrections officers , said the issue is simpler than that .
“ We , too , can be threatened as a result of our careers , ” he said . “ I believe we meet the criteria . ”
The corrections officers ’ lawsuit says D.C. law backs them up . Key provisions that call for enhanced penalties in the killing of police and that allow guns to be carried by on-duty law enforcement personnel both recognize corrections officers .
“ These guys were law enforcement officers in every way , shape and form , ” said attorney Aaron Page , who is also assisting in the lawsuit .
Within the jail facilities , they were empowered to make arrests and investigate incidents such as assaults on inmates or other corrections officers , Mr . Page said . They could also make arrests in cases of parole violations .
“ They are really no different than Park Police . They just have a certain jurisdiction , ” he said .
In court , attorneys for the District have said the case should be thrown out , in part putting forth an argument that suggests the act does not convey a right to carry a gun for self-protection .
“ LEOSA does not confer a federal right to be free from fear or to an increased feeling of confidence because one carries a concealed weapon . And it does not require a state agency to classify a retired employee as having been a ‘ law enforcement officer , ’ ” the attorney general ’ s office argued in recent court filings .
Mr. Smith , who in his later years at the Department of Corrections also worked as a firearms instructor , vehemently disagrees .
“ I know this agency is wrong , but they look at us as the little people , ” he said . “ I can protect dignitaries and protect you by keeping criminals inside a penitentiary , but yet I can ’ t protect myself when I ’ m off . ”","It’s been six years since Robert L. Smith retired from his job as a corrections officer at the D.C. Jail, but he says he still receives threats from former inmates he supervised.

D.C. Jail officials have refused to sign off on paperwork that would certify Mr. Smith and his co-plaintiffs — Ronald DuBerry, Harold Bennette and Maurice Curtis — as retired law enforcement officers, making them ineligible to carry firearms under the federal act.

“In spite of their years of service that would qualify them to have a firearms permit under LEOSA, the District of Columbia is improperly asserting that these individuals never qualified as law enforcement officers with arrest authority,” attorneys William J. Phelan and F. Peter Silva II wrote in the lawsuit filed this summer in U.S. District Court for the District.

In conversation, attorney Chris Gowen, who is also working on the case, puts it more bluntly.

“In my opinion, it’s purely political,” he said.

Until this summer, when D.C. laws banning the carrying of handguns were overturned by a U.S. District Court judge, a federal permit was one of the few ways a D.C. resident could qualify to carry a firearm in the city.

Police officers, federal law enforcement officials, sheriff’s deputies and even Amtrak police can qualify under the federal law as long as they meet other criteria, such as retiring in good standing and keeping up firearms qualifications.

The first step to getting the federal certification is having a former employer sign paperwork to certify law enforcement experience.

But when human resource officials at the city’s jail received the request, officials checked a box indicating that the corrections officers did not have “statutory powers of arrest,” an automatic disqualifier for those seeking to carry under the federal statute.

The city takes the position that D.C. laws “do not in fact accord corrections officers with law enforcement status and arrest authority,” corrections spokeswoman Sylvia Lane said in an email response to questions.

She said corrections director Tom Faust “will not certify an application request for carrying a concealed weapon under LEOSA for retired employees, as corrections officers do not meet all of the required elements necessary.”

The National Fraternal Order of Police, which lobbied for the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, takes issue with the response, believing the law was meant to include corrections officers. But given the wide latitude in the authority and responsibilities of those who oversee local and state jails, jurisdictions have differed in practice.

“The authority of corrections officers vary widely,” said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police legislative center. “Some have arrest authority, and some do not.”

In Maryland, state corrections employees must have “full police powers” to be eligible, said Mark A. Vernarelli, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.

“Among correctional and Parole and Probation personnel, this might limit the eligibility to those such as detectives and Warrant Unit officers with 10 years of service and full police powers,” Mr. Vernarelli said.

Corrections officers at the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections also do not have powers of arrest and would not qualify, but department spokeswoman Yolanda Evans said the agency lets the state make the decision by offering letters to any retired employee who asks that they certify the number of years an employee worked there and whether or not they left in good standing.

Other corrections facilities, such as the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, are run by sheriff’s deputies, who are considered to have full police powers and would qualify under the federal law.

Brian Dawe, director of the nonprofit American Correctional Officer, said he thinks departments are worried about liability issues.

“When it comes to this particular benefit, they don’t want to give it out,” Mr. Dawe said.

The federal law stipulates that among the requirements for a government employee to be a qualified law enforcement officer, he or she must be “authorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of, or the incarceration of any person for, any violation of law, and has statutory powers of arrest” and “authorized by the agency to carry a firearm.”

But Sgt. John Rosser, chairman of the District’s Fraternal Order of Police labor unit representing corrections officers, said the issue is simpler than that.

“We, too, can be threatened as a result of our careers,” he said. “I believe we meet the criteria.”

The corrections officers’ lawsuit says D.C. law backs them up. Key provisions that call for enhanced penalties in the killing of police and that allow guns to be carried by on-duty law enforcement personnel both recognize corrections officers.

“These guys were law enforcement officers in every way, shape and form,” said attorney Aaron Page, who is also assisting in the lawsuit.

Within the jail facilities, they were empowered to make arrests and investigate incidents such as assaults on inmates or other corrections officers, Mr. Page said. They could also make arrests in cases of parole violations.

“They are really no different than Park Police. They just have a certain jurisdiction,” he said.

In court, attorneys for the District have said the case should be thrown out, in part putting forth an argument that suggests the act does not convey a right to carry a gun for self-protection.

“LEOSA does not confer a federal right to be free from fear or to an increased feeling of confidence because one carries a concealed weapon. And it does not require a state agency to classify a retired employee as having been a ‘law enforcement officer,’” the attorney general’s office argued in recent court filings.

Mr. Smith, who in his later years at the Department of Corrections also worked as a firearms instructor, vehemently disagrees.

“I know this agency is wrong, but they look at us as the little people,” he said. “I can protect dignitaries and protect you by keeping criminals inside a penitentiary, but yet I can’t protect myself when I’m off.”

Let the families of Newtown grieve. The rest of us need to get to work.

Terri Francis

In 2003, my cousin's 15-year-old son was shot and killed by a robber. My cousin found solidarity with other parents whose children had been snatched by gun violence, making instant activists out of moms and dads.

As I thought of the parents of Newtown over the past month, steeped in their grief, I realized how little I know, how little I have ever wanted to know, about the circumstances surrounding the gun death closest to me. I don't know what kind of gun was used to murder my own relative. Even if I did, what would it mean to me?

I've never owned a gun nor have I ever touched one. I have never even knowingly been in the presence of one. I have taken false and selfish comfort in believing that guns and the chaos connected to them were worlds away. Not wanting to wade into the debate around gun control, my position on guns has been one of naivety and willed ignorance.

But I won't avoid it any longer.

It is much easier to cry in front of my television and feel helpless than to learn what these weapons are, what they do and what I can do to make events like Newtown, Aurora, Tuscon and Virginia Tech less likely to happen again.

Our voices count.

Yes, civil discourse can be uncivil. But don't let toxic Internet trolls and television zealots stop you from participating in this vital public discussion.

The grieving families of Newtown and the grieving families of the hundreds of people who will have died from gun shootings since Sandy Hook will be conscripted to the front lines of the gun control debate. But we can't let them fight it on their own.

Because the truth is, when an average of eight children die from gun violence every day in this country, nobody is left untouched by a shooting death. Eventually, that evil will make its mark, directly or indirectly, on all of us.

In the wake of the one-month anniversary of the Newtown shootings, the country's grief over mass shootings, one-on-one gun violence and unintentional gun deaths weighs so heavily on our collective conscience that once again the nation seems ready to take action.

Yes, our elected officials must lead and we must hold them accountable if they don't. But we must do our part as well. We have to organize and shape public opinion to make it easier for the president and Congress to do what they must.

We can start by educating ourselves. Know what these weapons of mass destruction do, know who is trying to stop research on gun safety , know what organizations are pushing for more comprehensive bans. Once we're educated, we can educate our friends and families and build a groundswell, home by home, street by street and block by block.

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/12/18/gun-sales-surge-after-connecticut-massacre/,Gun sales surge after Connecticut massacre,2012-12-18,"William La Jeunesse, In March","The prospect of a renewed assault weapons ban in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre has set of a round of buying , as thousands of Americans head to their local gun store to secure the popular AR-15 -- the model used by the school gunman -- before potential government prohibitions on their purchase .
They are also buying the .223 ammunition used by the AR-15 and the type of high-capacity magazines covered under the last federal assault weapons ban , which Congress let expire without renewing .
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation says it set a new record for single-day background check submittals this past weekend .
In San Diego , Northwest Armory gun store owner Karl Durkheimer said Saturday `` was the biggest day we 've seen in 20 years . Sunday will probably eclipse that . ''
In southwest Ohio , from dawn to dusk a Cincinnati gun show had a line of 400 waiting to get in , said Joe Eaton of the Buckeye Firearms Association .
`` Sales were through the roof on Saturday , '' said Eaton . `` People were buying everything they could out of fear the president would try to ban certain guns and high-capacity magazines . ''
The deluge of buyers had officials working overtime . Background checks that normally took 15 minutes in California took more than four hours , Durkheimer said . In Colorado , background checks that normally take minutes turned into wait times of more than 12 hours , CBI spokeswoman Susan Medina told the Denver Post .
`` We had to call in extra staff , '' Medina was quoted in the Post story . `` The wait times were high . ''
The CBI says it processed more than 4,200 background checks on Saturday , the day after the Newtown , Conn. , shooting . That surpassed the previous high of 4,028 . Nationwide , FBI data shows 16.4 million background checks were run in 2011 . An agency spokesman said Monday it did not keep daily numbers and would not have figures for December until early January .
The Connecticut gunman , 20-year-old Adam Lanza , killed his mother before taking her car and her rifle and two handguns and driving to the Sandy Hook Elementary School . There he killed 20 children and six adults before taking his own life .
In the aftermath of the tragedy , Democratic lawmakers have argued there is a need for new gun measures , and President Obama has seemed to move in that direction without voicing support for specific legislation .
Gun owners are n't just afraid of losing their right to buy certain guns . Jeff Serdy , owner of AJI Sporting Goods in Apache Junction , Ariz. , said his buyers were buying ammunition .
`` I am selling a ton of ammunition , '' Serdy said . `` My people figure it is easier for the president to ban ammunition sales than to get a gun bill through Congress . ''
Other countries have tried limiting the sale of ammunition as an easier alternative to banning guns . Mexico for example , bans any `` military cartridge . '' In the U.S. , the AR-15 and M-16 ammunition use the same bullet , the .223 and NATO 5.56 mm round .
Serdy said he was out of the cheaper $ 700 to $ 800 versions of the AR-15 but still had some priced at $ 1100 and up .
The AR-15 is the civilian version of the military 's M-16 and M-4 . In surveys , about 50 percent of buyers say they own AR-15s for target practice ; 30 percent for hunting and the rest for personal protection . Despite often being called a fringe gun by critics , the AR-15 is the most popular gun sold in the US today , according to gun dealers . Roughly 220,000 were sold in 2010 , after peaking at more than 300,000 immediately following Obama 's election .
Sen. Diane Feinstein said Monday she will introduce a new assault weapons bill in January to stop the sale of more than 100 types of assault weapons .
`` On the first day of the new Congress , I intend to introduce a bill stopping the sale , transfer , importation and manufacturing of assault weapons as well as large ammunition magazines , strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds , '' Feinstein said . `` I am in the process of gathering support for the bill in the Senate and House . ''
The previous assault weapons ban lasted from 1994 through 2004 . It defined an assault weapon as any gun that was :
- semi automatic , meaning one round is fired per each pull of the trigger
While the weapons look menacing , many gun advocates say they are no more deadly than some other guns that use a larger and heavier bullet .

They are also buying the .223 ammunition used by the AR-15 and the type of high-capacity magazines covered under the last federal assault weapons ban, which Congress let expire without renewing.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation says it set a new record for single-day background check submittals this past weekend.

In San Diego, Northwest Armory gun store owner Karl Durkheimer said Saturday ""was the biggest day we've seen in 20 years. Sunday will probably eclipse that.""

In southwest Ohio, from dawn to dusk a Cincinnati gun show had a line of 400 waiting to get in, said Joe Eaton of the Buckeye Firearms Association.

""Sales were through the roof on Saturday,"" said Eaton. ""People were buying everything they could out of fear the president would try to ban certain guns and high-capacity magazines.""

The deluge of buyers had officials working overtime. Background checks that normally took 15 minutes in California took more than four hours, Durkheimer said. In Colorado, background checks that normally take minutes turned into wait times of more than 12 hours, CBI spokeswoman Susan Medina told the Denver Post.

""We had to call in extra staff,"" Medina was quoted in the Post story. ""The wait times were high.""

The CBI says it processed more than 4,200 background checks on Saturday, the day after the Newtown, Conn., shooting. That surpassed the previous high of 4,028. Nationwide, FBI data shows 16.4 million background checks were run in 2011. An agency spokesman said Monday it did not keep daily numbers and would not have figures for December until early January.

The Connecticut gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, killed his mother before taking her car and her rifle and two handguns and driving to the Sandy Hook Elementary School. There he killed 20 children and six adults before taking his own life.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, Democratic lawmakers have argued there is a need for new gun measures, and President Obama has seemed to move in that direction without voicing support for specific legislation.

Gun owners aren't just afraid of losing their right to buy certain guns. Jeff Serdy, owner of AJI Sporting Goods in Apache Junction, Ariz., said his buyers were buying ammunition.

""I am selling a ton of ammunition,"" Serdy said. ""My people figure it is easier for the president to ban ammunition sales than to get a gun bill through Congress.""

Other countries have tried limiting the sale of ammunition as an easier alternative to banning guns. Mexico for example, bans any ""military cartridge."" In the U.S., the AR-15 and M-16 ammunition use the same bullet, the .223 and NATO 5.56 mm round.

Serdy said he was out of the cheaper $700 to $800 versions of the AR-15 but still had some priced at $1100 and up.

The AR-15 is the civilian version of the military's M-16 and M-4. In surveys, about 50 percent of buyers say they own AR-15s for target practice; 30 percent for hunting and the rest for personal protection. Despite often being called a fringe gun by critics, the AR-15 is the most popular gun sold in the US today, according to gun dealers. Roughly 220,000 were sold in 2010, after peaking at more than 300,000 immediately following Obama's election.

Sen. Diane Feinstein said Monday she will introduce a new assault weapons bill in January to stop the sale of more than 100 types of assault weapons.

""On the first day of the new Congress, I intend to introduce a bill stopping the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons as well as large ammunition magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds,"" Feinstein said. ""I am in the process of gathering support for the bill in the Senate and House.""

The previous assault weapons ban lasted from 1994 through 2004. It defined an assault weapon as any gun that was:

- semi automatic, meaning one round is fired per each pull of the trigger

- used a detachable magazine

And featured any two of the following attributes:

- a folding or telescopic stock

- a pistol grip

- a bayonet mount

- a flash suppressor

- a grenade launcher

While the weapons look menacing, many gun advocates say they are no more deadly than some other guns that use a larger and heavier bullet. And since they are semi-automatic, they should not be called or confused with the fully automatic military version. Nor should a gun used by millions be outlawed because of the actions of a mentally ill young man.

Critics however say these high-power weapons, capable of firing multiple rounds quickly, are too dangerous, since their high velocity rounds can pierce most body armor and

their magazines allow for mass shootings.

Yet, statistics show, unlike handguns or shotguns, rifles account for only a fraction of homicides in the United States. Of 12,664 murder victims last year, only 323 were killed with rifles, according to the FBI.

Both the Paducah, Ky., and Columbine, Colo., mass school killings occurred during the 10-year ban. In Paducah, the killer used a .22 caliber long rifle, 12 gauge pump-action shotgun and a Ruger MK II .22-caliber pistol.

In Columbine, the shooters used 99 explosive devices, a 12 gauge pump action shotgun. Hi-Point 995 Carbine 9 mm carbine, a 9 mm Intratec TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, and a 12-gauge Stevens 311D double-barreled sawed-off shotgun.

In 2007, the Virginia Tech shooter used a Glock and Walther handgun to kill 32 and wounded 17.

We must seek agreement on gun reforms

Arizona Daily Star

March 13, 2011

By Barack Obama

It's been more than two months since the tragedy in Tucson stunned the nation. It was a moment when we came together as one people to mourn and to pray for those we lost. And in the attack's turbulent wake, Americans by and large rightly refrained from finger-pointing, assigning blame or playing politics with other people's pain.



But one clear and terrible fact remains. A man our Army rejected as unfit for service; a man one of our colleges deemed too unstable for studies; a man apparently bent on violence, was able to walk into a store and buy a gun.



He used it to murder six people and wound 13 others. And if not for the heroism of bystanders and a brilliant surgical team, it would have been far worse.



But since that day, we have lost perhaps another 2,000 members of our American family to gun violence. Thousands more have been wounded. We lose the same number of young people to guns every day and a half as we did at Columbine, and every four days as we did at Virginia Tech.



Every single day, America is robbed of more futures. It has awful consequences for our society. And as a society, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to put a stop to it.



Now, like the majority of Americans, I believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. And the courts have settled that as the law of the land. In this country, we have a strong tradition of gun ownership that's handed from generation to generation. Hunting and shooting are part of our national heritage. And, in fact, my administration has not curtailed the rights of gun owners - it has expanded them, including allowing people to carry their guns in national parks and wildlife refuges.



The fact is, almost all gun owners in America are highly responsible. They're our friends and neighbors. They buy their guns legally and use them safely, whether for hunting or target shooting, collection or protection. And that's something that gun-safety advocates need to accept. Likewise, advocates for gun owners should accept the awful reality that gun violence affects Americans everywhere, whether on the streets of Chicago or at a supermarket in Tucson.



I know that every time we try to talk about guns, it can reinforce stark divides. People shout at one another, which makes it impossible to listen. We mire ourselves in stalemate, which makes it impossible to get to where we need to go as a country.



However, I believe that if common sense prevails, we can get beyond wedge issues and stale political debates to find a sensible, intelligent way to make the United States of America a safer, stronger place.



I'm willing to bet that responsible, law-abiding gun owners agree that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few - dangerous criminals and fugitives, for example - from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.



I'm willing to bet they don't think that using a gun and using common sense are incompatible ideas - that we should check someone's criminal record before he can check out at a gun seller; that an unbalanced man shouldn't be able to buy a gun so easily; that there's room for us to have reasonable laws that uphold liberty, ensure citizen safety and are fully compatible with a robust Second Amendment.



That's why our focus right now should be on sound and effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.

First, we should begin by enforcing laws that are already on the books. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is the filter that's supposed to stop the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun. Bipartisan legislation four years ago was supposed to strengthen this system, but it hasn't been properly implemented. It relies on data supplied by states - but that data is often incomplete and inadequate. We must do better.

Second, we should in fact reward the states that provide the best data - and therefore do the most to protect our citizens.

Third, we should make the system faster and nimbler. We should provide an instant, accurate, comprehensive and consistent system for background checks to sellers who want to do the right thing, and make sure that criminals can't escape it.

Porous background checks are bad for police officers, for law-abiding citizens and for the sellers themselves. If we're serious about keeping guns away from someone who's made up his mind to kill, then we can't allow a situation where a responsible seller denies him a weapon at one store, but he effortlessly buys the same gun someplace else.



Clearly, there's more we can do to prevent gun violence. But I want this to at least be the beginning of a new discussion on how we can keep America safe for all our people.



I know some aren't interested in participating. Some will say that anything short of the most sweeping anti-gun legislation is a capitulation to the gun lobby. Others will predictably cast any discussion as the opening salvo in a wild-eyed scheme to take away everybody's guns. And such hyperbole will become the fodder for overheated fundraising letters.



But I have more faith in the American people than that. Most gun-control advocates know that most gun owners are responsible citizens. Most gun owners know that the word ""commonsense"" isn't a code word for ""confiscation."" And none of us should be willing to remain passive in the face of violence or resigned to watching helplessly as another rampage unfolds on television.



As long as those whose lives are shattered by gun violence don't get to look away and move on, neither can we.

Sen. Lieberman says NRA is willing to deal with every possible cause ""except guns""

The gun control debate was reignited by the mass shooting at Connecticut elementary school

Hutchinson tells CNN his panel will give educators instructions on placing guards in schools

The National Rifle Association made clear Sunday it will not budge on its opposition to any new gun laws, despite heated criticism of the organization's response to the Connecticut school massacre.

""I know this town wants to argue about gun control,"" the group's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in Washington. ""I don't think it will work.""

LaPierre stood by remarks he made at an event Friday billed as a news conference -- though he took no questions -- in which he argued for armed guards in schools.

""If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,"" he said on Sunday.

He added that in Friday's news conference, ""I said what I honestly thought and what millions, and hundreds of millions, of people all over this country believe will actually make a difference.""

""We're going to support an immediate appropriation before Congress to put police officers in every school,"" he vowed.

Legislation being pushed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, to restore an assault weapons ban is not going to make kids any safer, LaPierre insisted.

Background checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions , but more importantly , limit the size of the market ( and therefore , profits ) in two ways .

If , when only 8 % of Americans oppose the policy , you ca n't get a law that is designed to keep criminals and the insane from buying guns because of the power of the gun lobby , you certainly are n't going to get anything like confiscation when there would be massive opposition .
Moreover , even in some unimaginable world in which you could get gun confiscation , universal background checks would make no difference -- there are about 300 million guns in America with no need to go through any background check .

John J. Donohue

Gun manufacturers.

They are the ones who call the shots at the NRA, and they are the most important people in the opposition. The manufacturers don't want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits.

Background checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions, but more importantly, limit the size of the market (and therefore, profits) in two ways.

The direct loss of profit comes because closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system will shut off sales to criminals and the mentally ill who are effectively free to buy all the guns they want at gun shows and through private transactions.

The bill goes into effect on January 1, 2014. It was drafted after a federal appeals court struck down a state law banning people from carrying concealed weapons in public last September, saying it violated the Second Amendment. Earlier this year, Illinois lawmakers overrode Quinn's veto of parts of a gun control bill that would have allowed individuals to carry more than one gun, carry guns into establishments serving alcohol, and carry partially concealed guns.",www.foxnews.com,right,yvgApMzAkEn1B6qi

The terrible shootings in Gilroy , El Paso , and Dayton in the past week have renewed cries for Washington , D.C. , to do something . In our federal system , the most effective responses will have to come from state and local governments , which have the primary responsibility and the broadest tools for reducing violent crime .

President Trump this week seized on the idea of expanding background checks for firearm purchasers . Before a Wednesday visit to Dayton and El Paso , where weekend shootings left 31 dead , Trump said there “ was great appetite for background checks. ” A proposal from Senators Patrick J. Toomey ( R. , Pa. ) and Joe Manchin ( D. , W.Va. ) would expand the reviews to private transactions that were advertised publicly or took place at gun shows . Expanding background checks remains popular with the public , with about 90 percent , including eight in ten Republicans , in support .
According to media reports , however , the National Rifle Association has criticized the idea . Some conservatives have questioned whether such rules are effective , noting that the shooters in all three cases would still have gotten hold of their high-powered weapons even if Toomey-Manchin were on the books . Neither side cited empirical studies that can answer the real question : Would expanded background checks deter future mass shooters — as well as ordinary murderers , who take far more lives , or foreign terrorists — from acquiring and using high-powered weapons ?
But what conservatives should not worry about is whether expanded background checks would intrude on the Second Amendment . Because identity politics is all the rage these days , I suppose I should make clear that I am no gun-control advocate , even though I am a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley . I may be one of the few unfortunates who live within the city limits of the People ’ s Republic of Berkeley who own guns — though that may be because I grew up in Pennsylvania , where some schools have a day off at the start of hunting season . There are probably few other members of the Faculty Club who also belong to the Richmond ( Calif. ) Rod and Gun Club — if there are , I haven ’ t seen them at the range . I am sure that writing this op-ed will spark a movement to petition the Berkeley City Council to have me expelled from the city — again .
But unfortunately for most Berkeley residents , the Second Amendment declares : “ A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed. ” In Heller v. District of Columbia ( 2008 ) , the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear firearms , rather than just a collective right to a well-armed militia . The “ inherent right to self-defense , ” the Court found , is “ central to the Second Amendment right. ” As a result , the District of Columbia could not ban handgun possession in the home .
The Court also emphasized , however , that the Second Amendment is not “ unlimited. ” It is not a right “ to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. ” Instead , the Court provided examples of permissible regulation of firearms consistent with the Second Amendment . The right does not “ protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes , such as short-barreled shotguns , ” nor does it grant an unregulated right to carry concealed firearms . These limits were “ supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons . ”
With regard to background checks , the Court included examples of “ presumptively lawful regulatory measures. ” According to the majority , “ nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . ”
Although the Court subsequently found that the 14th Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment against the states in McDonald v. City of Chicago ( 2010 ) , the Supreme Court has not decided another case on the Second Amendment . Several federal appeals courts , however , have adopted a two-part test to review limitations on firearm possession . These courts ask whether “ a particular provision impinges upon a right protected by the Second Amendment. ” In applying this first step , the courts have found that a regulation that is “ long-standing ” is “ presumptively lawful ” because it has been long accepted by the public and unlikely to burden a constitutional right . Second , the courts ask whether “ the provision passes muster under the appropriate level of scrutiny. ” In applying this crucial second step , these circuit courts have chosen to apply intermediate , rather than strict , scrutiny , which allows the government to engage in a reasonable balancing between public safety and the individual right .
Expanding federal background checks should survive the first step of this post-Heller analysis . To be sure , the federal background-check system does not appear to be a long-standing regulation ; it began with the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act . The background-check system , however , is merely a means to carry out regulations that are long-standing . Enacted in 1968 , the federal Gun Control Act prohibits the transfer of handguns to , among others , convicted felons and anyone under 21 .
Neither the Supreme Court nor the federal courts of appeals have held these restrictions on possession to violate the Constitution . As the Supreme Court observed in Heller , its decision does not “ cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill. ” If these restrictions do not violate the Second Amendment , it is difficult to find that a background-check system would violate it , as a background-check system is only a means of enforcing the underlying rules . Indeed , the background-check system would appear to be a vital mechanism to ensure that firearms sellers do not violate the terms of the national Gun Control Act .
Even if a court believed that the expanded background-check system failed the first step , courts of appeals would still uphold it if it survived intermediate scrutiny . When applying intermediate scrutiny , a court will ask whether a regulation is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective. ” Preventing the transfer of firearms to the categories of individuals prohibited by the Gun Control Act would qualify as an important governmental objective . Congress clearly seeks to prevent guns from coming into the possession of individuals who might misuse them for criminal purposes or might lack the appropriate level of personal responsibility and self-control . When Heller returned to the lower courts , the D.C . Circuit found that the governmental objectives served by registration requirements — protection of law-enforcement officers and crime control — satisfied the important governmental objective requirement . Those interests are among the same ones advanced by the proposed expanded background checks now .
In addition to an important governmental objective , the intermediate-scrutiny test requires a law be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve that objective . Narrow tailoring requires that the government objective would be achieved “ less effectively ” without the regulation , and the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary . No court has invalidated the existing background-check system as failing the intermediate scrutiny test to achieve the current goals of the Gun Control Act . The fit of the background-check system will not go awry because Congress has expanded it to include private transactions . ( Indeed , the Toomey/Manchin proposal would not even cover all private transactions — only the transfer of handguns at gun shows and sales where commercial advertising was involved . ) Indeed , the expansion of the background-check system will more effectively achieve the purposes of the 1968 Gun Control Act .
Conservatives might have a second concern with expanded background checks , not over the individual right at stake , but whether the government should have the power to regulate firearm transactions that occur wholly within a state .

The Constitution appears to give the federal government the authority only “ To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian Tribes. ” As the Framers made clear , and the written document confirms , the Constitution grants only a limited list of enumerated powers to the national government , so critics could claim that background checks can not extend to purely intrastate sales of firearms .

Tuccille, Eric Boehm, Orin S. Kerr, Charles Oliver, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","Students across the country plan to walk out of class at 10:00 a.m. today to protest the government 's failure to prevent crimes like the massacre at Parkland by tightening gun laws .
In doing so , the students are providing more evidence that increased safety is indeed the paramount goal of modern millennial and Gen Z political activism . They want to feel comfortable and protected , and they are willing to curtail other people 's rights to achieve this .
`` It 's not Republican or Democrat ; it 's about keeping people safe , '' Arielle Geismar , a 16-year-old student from Manhattan , told Vox .
Another student activist , 18-year-old Fiorina Talaba , said , `` We know what we want from our society : to have less guns and , at some point , no guns at all . `` *
Perhaps ironically , the administrators at Geismar 's school also cited public safety as their top concern , and used it to justify their reticence about the planned walkout :
Arielle Geismar , a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan , said her school administrators were primarily focused on student safety . `` There definitely was pushback in terms of disrupting classes , '' she said . `` But we 're going to be loud , and we 're not going to apologize for that . I think that 's also the point of the walkout . We 're going to make ourselves heard whether you want to hear it or not . ''
Of course Geismar and her fellow activists should n't apologize for making themselves heard , being loud , or walking out of class . Nor should their First Amendment rights be curtailed because some overly cautious administrators are concerned about safety .

CORRECTION : The statement , `` We know what we want from our society : to have less guns and , at some point , no guns at all , '' was initially attributed to Geismar , but it was said by Talaba .","Students across the country plan to walk out of class at 10:00 a.m. today to protest the government's failure to prevent crimes like the massacre at Parkland by tightening gun laws.

In doing so, the students are providing more evidence that increased safety is indeed the paramount goal of modern millennial and Gen Z political activism. They want to feel comfortable and protected, and they are willing to curtail other people's rights to achieve this.

""It's not Republican or Democrat; it's about keeping people safe,"" Arielle Geismar, a 16-year-old student from Manhattan, told Vox.

Another student activist, 18-year-old Fiorina Talaba, said, ""We know what we want from our society: to have less guns and, at some point, no guns at all.""*

Perhaps ironically, the administrators at Geismar's school also cited public safety as their top concern, and used it to justify their reticence about the planned walkout:

Arielle Geismar, a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan, said her school administrators were primarily focused on student safety. ""There definitely was pushback in terms of disrupting classes,"" she said. ""But we're going to be loud, and we're not going to apologize for that. I think that's also the point of the walkout. We're going to make ourselves heard whether you want to hear it or not.""

Of course Geismar and her fellow activists shouldn't apologize for making themselves heard, being loud, or walking out of class. Nor should their First Amendment rights be curtailed because some overly cautious administrators are concerned about safety. Public safety is frequently used as a pretext for trampling the civil rights of some group or another. Think of racist stop-and-frisk policies, the anti-Muslim bigotry of domestic War on Terror paranoia, or the immigrant purges of the Trump era. Such measures are often justified on grounds of safety, security, and comfort.

`` Let 's not let arguments over the Constitution 's Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney wrote in a response Wednesday .
`` Americans may disagree on matters of public policy and express those disagreements vigorously , but no one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment -- or any other matter of public concern , '' Carney added .
The nation 's largest retailer , meanwhile , made news for reversing a decision -- and saying it will participate in a White House meeting .
Wal-Mart initially said scheduling conflicts would prevent its `` experts '' on gun control from attending . But on Wednesday it announced it will send representatives to the Thursday meeting .
The company has had `` ongoing conversations with the administration , Congress , ( New York ) Mayor ( Michael ) Bloomberg 's office , sportsmen groups , suppliers and others to listen and share our thoughts and experiences , '' company spokesman David Tovar said in a statement to CNN .
`` Knowing our senior leaders could not be in Washington this week , we spoke in advance with the vice president 's office to share our perspective , '' he said . `` We underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting on Thursday in person , so we are sending an appropriate representative to participate . ''
Across the country , people are sharing their views on what Washington should decide . Among them are Californians who have packed town hall meetings
Some have spoken out in support of renewing a ban on assault weapons -- high-capacity weapons that have been used in numerous mass shootings . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , is pushing to reinstate a ban that expired in 2004
But others at the town halls argue that banning those guns is n't the answer , and could even be a slippery slope toward banning all guns .
`` Gun violence has been on a rampage as we know first hand and we know painfully . We must stop the madness , my friends , '' he said . `` It has been enough . ''
Bloomberg , a longtime advocate of stricter gun control , is pushing for tough steps nationwide
In Connecticut , Gov . Dannel Malloy choked up discussing the Newtown shooting , and said `` more guns are not the answer . ''
`` Freedom is not a handgun on the hip of every teacher and security should not mean a guard posted outside every classroom , '' he said Wednesday in the State of the State address .
Burlington , Vermont , a city of less than 43,000 people , has already made a move of its own : passing a resolution that could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines .
The city council voted 10-3 in favor of the resolution , which will now be presented in public hearings and voted on by the public before going to the state legislature .
Amid the cacophony of voices battling over the issue , two young former Marines have found themselves in a spotlight online , representing very different views .
First , Joshua Boston posted on CNN iReport an open letter to Feinstein explaining why he would not abide by an assault weapons ban . `` I do not believe it is the government 's right to know what I own , '' he wrote in the post , which went viral . `` Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime .

Gun lobby faces challenge

On Thursday, Biden's group will hear from the other side: gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association.

The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, but that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided.

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has called for all U.S. schools to have armed guards

NRA President David Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards.

A rising chorus of voices is standing up against the NRA and the gun lobby's sway over U.S. politics.

Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, shot in the head in a mass shooting two years ago, and her husband Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, launched a new political action committee Tuesday to end what they called lawmakers' ""fear"" of the gun lobby.

White House responds to petition to deport Piers Morgan

CNN's Piers Morgan has also garnered attention for speaking out against the influence of the gun lobby and pushing stricter gun control, which led more than 100,000 people to sign a petition on the White House website calling for him to be deported.

""Let's not let arguments over the Constitution's Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney wrote in a response Wednesday.

""Americans may disagree on matters of public policy and express those disagreements vigorously, but no one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment -- or any other matter of public concern,"" Carney added.

Carney's response did not mention Morgan by name.

Wal-Mart changes tune, will attend White House meeting

The nation's largest retailer, meanwhile, made news for reversing a decision -- and saying it will participate in a White House meeting.

Wal-Mart initially said scheduling conflicts would prevent its ""experts"" on gun control from attending. But on Wednesday it announced it will send representatives to the Thursday meeting.

The company has had ""ongoing conversations with the administration, Congress, (New York) Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg's office, sportsmen groups, suppliers and others to listen and share our thoughts and experiences,"" company spokesman David Tovar said in a statement to CNN.

""Knowing our senior leaders could not be in Washington this week, we spoke in advance with the vice president's office to share our perspective,"" he said. ""We underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting on Thursday in person, so we are sending an appropriate representative to participate.""

Wal-Mart sells guns and ammunition.

States, cities make their own moves

Across the country, people are sharing their views on what Washington should decide. Among them are Californians who have packed town hall meetings

Some have spoken out in support of renewing a ban on assault weapons -- high-capacity weapons that have been used in numerous mass shootings. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, is pushing to reinstate a ban that expired in 2004

But others at the town halls argue that banning those guns isn't the answer, and could even be a slippery slope toward banning all guns.

""Gun violence has been on a rampage as we know first hand and we know painfully. We must stop the madness, my friends,"" he said. ""It has been enough.""

Bloomberg, a longtime advocate of stricter gun control, is pushing for tough steps nationwide

In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy choked up discussing the Newtown shooting, and said ""more guns are not the answer.""

""Freedom is not a handgun on the hip of every teacher and security should not mean a guard posted outside every classroom,"" he said Wednesday in the State of the State address.

Burlington, Vermont, a city of less than 43,000 people, has already made a move of its own: passing a resolution that could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.

The city council voted 10-3 in favor of the resolution, which will now be presented in public hearings and voted on by the public before going to the state legislature.

Amid the cacophony of voices battling over the issue, two young former Marines have found themselves in a spotlight online, representing very different views.

First, Joshua Boston posted on CNN iReport an open letter to Feinstein explaining why he would not abide by an assault weapons ban. ""I do not believe it is the government's right to know what I own,"" he wrote in the post, which went viral. ""Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime.""",www.cnn.com,left,IkpPlKBm9LZx3azA

Twelve people were killed and eight were wounded when Aaron Alexis , a Navy contractor , entered the sizable naval instillation in Washington and opened fire in Building 197 . The victims , whose ages ranged from 46 to 73 , all worked at the Navy Yard and many were gunned down as Alexis shot at them from above in the Navy building .

Earlier this year in the wake of the tragic Sandy Hook Shootings, the state of New York defied the U.S. Supreme Court by passing the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, a complete ban on magazines that hold more than seven rounds.

Since there is no such thing as a seven-round magazine for most guns, the law as written is essentially a total ban on semi-automatic firearms. In fact, the SAFE Act was drafted so hastily that legislators failed to exclude law enforcement agents from the ban, thus making it illegal for police officers to carry semi-automatic firearms, too.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared the legislation the “toughest” gun law in the nation, but that’s nothing to be proud of. The SAFE Act is actually unconstitutional. The Supreme Court made it clear in 2008 in District of Columbia v.

The message Mr. Cuomo is sending to other states is that when the Supreme Court speaks, its voice does not matter, and that’s exactly what Wallace did in 1963.

It doesn’t matter that this issue is about guns instead of race. After all, if New York can violate this civil right then other states can violate it, too. It may even open the door for them to violate other civil rights.

Imagine for a moment if Southern states took this as a cue that since New York is disregarding the Heller decision, then they can disregard the Roe v. Wade decision and illegally prosecute women for exercising their right to choose.

Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down Washington, D.C.’s gun ban in the 2008 Heller case, gun-control advocates in the District of Columbia went into shock. It took the District about three months to make actual, legislative changes that allowed residents to keep semi-automatic firearms in their homes.

Bloomberg 's pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns is launching the campaign in states where senators may be on the fence regarding a package of firearms proposals making its way to the Senate floor . As the push for that legislation appears to falter , President Obama plans to soon tour the country to talk about the need to reduce gun violence , a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News . Bloomberg also confirmed Sunday that he plans to spend $ 12 million to run ads in at least 10 states , suggesting there could be a political price to pay for opposing the measures .
And of course , Bloomberg 's personal obsession and mission against the National Rifle Association continues .
NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre on Sunday challenged New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's plan to spend $ 12 million on ads meant to pressure senators into backing strict new gun control measures , saying Bloomberg `` ca n't buy America . ''
Making clear he intends to be a counterweight to the NRA , Bloomberg said he wants to make sure the powerful gun lobby is not `` the only voice '' in this debate . If he can achieve that , Bloomberg said , `` then I think my money would be well spent . ''
`` He ca n't spend enough of his $ 27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public , '' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' `` He ca n't buy America . ''

Obama will travel around the country on a gun control tour, despite Democrat Harry Reid killing Senator Dianne Feinstein's latest gun control legislation last week. Reid has offered for Feinstein to issue her legislation as an amendment, but won't bring the legislation as part of a larger gun control package to the Senate floor for a vote.

Bloomberg's pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns is launching the campaign in states where senators may be on the fence regarding a package of firearms proposals making its way to the Senate floor. As the push for that legislation appears to falter, President Obama plans to soon tour the country to talk about the need to reduce gun violence, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News. Bloomberg also confirmed Sunday that he plans to spend $12 million to run ads in at least 10 states, suggesting there could be a political price to pay for opposing the measures.

And of course, Bloomberg's personal obsession and mission against the National Rifle Association continues.

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre on Sunday challenged New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to spend $12 million on ads meant to pressure senators into backing strict new gun control measures, saying Bloomberg ""can't buy America.""



Making clear he intends to be a counterweight to the NRA, Bloomberg said he wants to make sure the powerful gun lobby is not ""the only voice"" in this debate. If he can achieve that, Bloomberg said, ""then I think my money would be well spent.""



LaPierre bristled at Bloomberg's comments.



""He can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public,"" LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He can't buy America.""

Spencer Green/AP Why is Chicago struggling with gun violence? N.Y. might have answers.,2013-02-02,Mark Guarino,"At first glance , it might appear that Chicago is doing many things right in its fight against gun violence .
Strict gun laws prohibit the purchase of guns within city limits , ban the possession of assault weapons , and call for steep fines if stolen or lost guns are not reported to police . Moreover , the Chicago Police Department seized 7,400 guns used in crimes in 2012 – more than twice what New York City did , for example .
Yet Chicago is in the midst of its worst period of gun violence in years . Its 513 homicides last year was a four-year high , and last month ’ s 42 homicides were the most in a January since 2002 . Meanwhile , much larger New York had only 414 homicides in 2012 – an all-time low . If it had Chicago ’ s murder rate , New York would have totaled more than 1,400 .
Both cities have tough gun laws , and both face the problem of weapons used in crimes being brought in from outside their borders . But New York has distinguished itself by its anti-gang program . Though experts acknowledge that New York and Chicago are different cites with different factors in play , they point to New York ’ s work in reducing gang violence as a game-changer .
“ If you remove gang-related incidents from the Chicago homicide statistics , the homicide rate involving normal citizens is much lower , ” says James Alan Fox , a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston .
New York ’ s experience suggests that Chicago ’ s emphasis on seizures , while not necessarily counterproductive , might not be the most effective tool for lowering its homicide rate .
“ It ’ s certainly good to get guns off the street and the more guns you can acquire can ’ t hurt . But in places like Chicago where you can go outside the city line and buy all the guns you want , it ’ s not clear that [ gun seizures ] have any demonstrable impact on crime , ” says Richard Berk , a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
For one , keeping track of guns is notoriously difficult . Straw gun purchasing , in which guns are purchased legally but are passed to another person for criminal purposes , is a problem in every major city . In Chicago , 20 percent of the guns used to commit crimes between 2008 and March 2012 originated in the suburb of Riverdale , Ill. , because of a single store there – Chuck ’ s Gun Shop , according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab . The store owners say they follow federal and state laws and are not legally responsible for how , or where , the guns they sell are used .
The state of New York faces a similar problem . Some 84 percent of gun crimes were carried out with guns purchased over the state border , according to the US Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
“ Coordination [ of gun laws ] is a big problem , not just because there are so many different philosophies of government , but also because of the nuts and bolts of enforcement , ” says Harold Pollack , a co-director of the University of Chicago lab .
What does separate Chicago from New York City is its gang activity . Chicago leads the country in terms of the number of individuals who are direct gang members or involved in gang factions , which are splinter groups associated with larger criminal organizations . There are an estimated 70 to 100 gangs in the Chicago metropolitan area with a membership of between 68,000 and 150,000 , according to the 2012 Chicago Crime Commission . New York gang membership is about 22,000 , reports the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2009 .
Professor Fox of Northeastern says Chicago has a larger minority underclass and harsher socioeconomic conditions than New York City , which makes it difficult to compare the homicide rates of both cities .
“ They ’ re different cities , they ’ re different in terms of demography , they ’ re different geographically , ” he says . “ These are big factors . ”
But in October , New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced “ Operation Crew Cut , ” which doubled the size of its gang division from 150 to 300 detectives . It is indicative of how New York has become a national leader in taking on gangs , experts say .
“ One of the most interesting stories in policing is why New York has not experienced gang problems to the extent that other cities like Chicago and L.A. have , ” Chuck Wexler , executive director of the Police Executive Research Foundation Forum , told ABC News . “ Kelly 's recognition of this emerging issue of gang activity in New York and his comprehensive approach using social media will be watched closely . ”
Representatives from the Chicago Police Department did not respond to numerous e-mails and phone messages seeking interviews Friday .
For now , Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has announced he is reassigning 200 officers from desk duties to street patrols of the city ’ s West and South Sides , where gun violence is highest . That is in addition to the 500 new officers he wants hired in 2013 .
Last month , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg swore in 830 recruits .","At first glance, it might appear that Chicago is doing many things right in its fight against gun violence.

But in places like Chicago where you can go outside the city line and buy all the guns you want, it’s not clear that [gun seizures] have any demonstrable impact on crime,” says Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

For one, keeping track of guns is notoriously difficult. Straw gun purchasing, in which guns are purchased legally but are passed to another person for criminal purposes, is a problem in every major city. In Chicago, 20 percent of the guns used to commit crimes between 2008 and March 2012 originated in the suburb of Riverdale, Ill., because of a single store there – Chuck’s Gun Shop, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab. The store owners say they follow federal and state laws and are not legally responsible for how, or where, the guns they sell are used.

The state of New York faces a similar problem. Some 84 percent of gun crimes were carried out with guns purchased over the state border, according to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

“Coordination [of gun laws] is a big problem, not just because there are so many different philosophies of government, but also because of the nuts and bolts of enforcement,” says Harold Pollack, a co-director of the University of Chicago lab.

What does separate Chicago from New York City is its gang activity. Chicago leads the country in terms of the number of individuals who are direct gang members or involved in gang factions, which are splinter groups associated with larger criminal organizations. There are an estimated 70 to 100 gangs in the Chicago metropolitan area with a membership of between 68,000 and 150,000, according to the 2012 Chicago Crime Commission. New York gang membership is about 22,000, reports the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2009.

Professor Fox of Northeastern says Chicago has a larger minority underclass and harsher socioeconomic conditions than New York City, which makes it difficult to compare the homicide rates of both cities.

“They’re different cities, they’re different in terms of demography, they’re different geographically,” he says. “These are big factors.”

But in October, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced “Operation Crew Cut,” which doubled the size of its gang division from 150 to 300 detectives. It is indicative of how New York has become a national leader in taking on gangs, experts say.

“One of the most interesting stories in policing is why New York has not experienced gang problems to the extent that other cities like Chicago and L.A. have,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Foundation Forum, told ABC News. “Kelly's recognition of this emerging issue of gang activity in New York and his comprehensive approach using social media will be watched closely.”

Representatives from the Chicago Police Department did not respond to numerous e-mails and phone messages seeking interviews Friday.

For now, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has announced he is reassigning 200 officers from desk duties to street patrols of the city’s West and South Sides, where gun violence is highest. That is in addition to the 500 new officers he wants hired in 2013.

In Canada , attitudes about guns are toughening too – as Canadians have gotten spooked that the violence south of the border is moving north .
The El Paso and Dayton shootings made front-page news in Canada , but it came alongside domestic stories of Canada ’ s own gun problems . Over what was a long weekend in Toronto , local headlines were dominated by 17 shootings in 14 different incidents across the city .
Weaker gun regulations in the U.S. have long undermined Canada ’ s much stricter rules , as guns get trafficked north . Last week Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair said Canada could reduce violence with more money towards stopping guns from the U.S. , which he called “ the greatest arsenal in the world . ”
But as gun incidents have increased , especially in Toronto , the government is facing new pressure for more gun control , including with a ban on handguns .
One group on the forefront pushing for tougher laws is the Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns ( CDPG ) , which was formally launched in February . The group ’ s leading voice is Najma Ahmed , a trauma surgeon in Toronto who says she is increasingly in the operating room dealing with gunshot injuries , including after a rare mass shooting on a Toronto street on a summer evening that killed two girls just over a year ago .
CDPG ’ s work would be aided by tougher American gun laws , Dr. Ahmed says , as a significant percentage of guns used in crime in Canada come from the U.S. “ I certainly would like to see a decrease in the proliferation of guns in the U.S. ; that would certainly make our job in Canada easier . ”
But the group has applied pressure on politicians at home , calling for an outright ban on handguns and assault-style weapons . They support the passage of Bill C-71 this spring , which tightens record keeping requirements and other regulations for gun owners . But they say the government must go much farther , and that for too long Canada has compared itself to the U.S. instead of peers with similar restrictive gun cultures like the United Kingdom . “ I think we are at a tipping point , ” Dr. Ahmed says .
As groups have pushed for tighter gun laws , especially ahead of federal elections in October , gun advocates have pushed back in U.S.-style polarization around guns that is new for Canada .
Tracey Wilson , vice president of public relations for the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights , says a mass shooting in the U.S. always gets intertwined with the situation at home , especially when sharing attention with Toronto violence . “ It sort of triggers people to be afraid that the violence that we see here could increase to that level . And I think it 's valid that they have concerns about that , because I think we all do , ” she says . “ However , you know all the evidence is extremely clear , and Canadians know it 's not sport shooters and duck hunters running around the streets shooting people up . ”
The CDPG – who criticize the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights for adopting NRA-style harassment tactics , which the coalition denies – say this takes away from the issue at hand . “ There 's a simple irrefutable fact , which is the less guns there are in the country the less deaths and injuries there are in the country from guns no matter where they 're from , ” says Philip Berger , the former chief of family and community medicine at St. Michael 's Hospital in Toronto and a founder of the CDPG .
According to Statistics Canada , firearm-related crime has gone up by 42 % since 2013 . Each year since 2009 , about six in ten firearm-related violent crimes involved handguns .
Mexico has seen an uptick in gun violence too . It recorded its highest homicide rate in history in 2018 . Mexico 's Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection released a report showing over 33,300 intentional homicides last year . That was a 15 percent increase over 2017 , which previously held the record . The Center for American Progress study also shows an increase in recent years in guns used in homicides in Mexico .
But it ’ s the current political climate that could firm up the government ’ s pressure on the U.S . The current Mexican government has ceded to President Trump ’ s demands that it staunch the flow of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. or face tariffs . Mexican officials want to show the public that they can get something back .
And the El Paso shooting in particular – an attack in a Latino city that the Spanish newspaper El País called “ greatest racist crime against Hispanics in modern United States history ” – is a point of mobilization .
John Lindsay-Poland , a U.S.-based researcher and activist for stopping U.S. legal arms sales to Mexico , says it shifts attention among the Mexican public to the white nationalist threat that they face – and to focus attention on the gun politics that are changing in the U.S .

“ The current of controlling guns and of preventing gun violence in the United States has grown enormously , so I do think there 's a possible inflection point within the U.S. And for Mexicans I think that becomes an important piece because so many Mexicans are just resigned that things are never going to change , ” he says . “ But I think it is possible to achieve some changes that would be meaningful for Mexico and not just meaningful for the U.S . ”
“ They could begin to frame the violence in Mexico as around guns not , not just around criminal organizations , impunity , or drugs . ”","President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged U.S. leaders to reflect upon the “indiscriminate sale of guns.” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard went further, threatening to open up a terrorist probe across the border.

America’s neighbors have long lived with the cross-border creep of U.S. gun culture – sometimes with outrage, often with a sense of resignation.

But the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, this month have emboldened foreign stances against lax U.S. gun laws and shifted conversations about what that means for crime and safety north and south of the U.S. border.

The shooting inside a Walmart in El Paso that claimed 22 lives in a matter of minutes was far more than just an American tragedy. More than a third of the victims counted in the death toll were Mexican citizens – prompting a rare, withering response south of the border.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged U.S. leaders from both parties to consider and reflect upon the “indiscriminate sale of guns,” he said in a press conference after the attack. Mexico’s Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard went further, threatening to open up a terrorist probe across the border.

The El Paso and Dayton shootings made front-page news in Canada, but it came alongside domestic stories of Canada’s own gun problems. Over what was a long weekend in Toronto, local headlines were dominated by 17 shootings in 14 different incidents across the city.

Weaker gun regulations in the U.S. have long undermined Canada’s much stricter rules, as guns get trafficked north. Last week Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair said Canada could reduce violence with more money towards stopping guns from the U.S., which he called “the greatest arsenal in the world.”

‘I think we are at a tipping point’

But as gun incidents have increased, especially in Toronto, the government is facing new pressure for more gun control, including with a ban on handguns.

One group on the forefront pushing for tougher laws is the Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns (CDPG), which was formally launched in February. The group’s leading voice is Najma Ahmed, a trauma surgeon in Toronto who says she is increasingly in the operating room dealing with gunshot injuries, including after a rare mass shooting on a Toronto street on a summer evening that killed two girls just over a year ago.

CDPG’s work would be aided by tougher American gun laws, Dr. Ahmed says, as a significant percentage of guns used in crime in Canada come from the U.S. “I certainly would like to see a decrease in the proliferation of guns in the U.S.; that would certainly make our job in Canada easier.”

But the group has applied pressure on politicians at home, calling for an outright ban on handguns and assault-style weapons. They support the passage of Bill C-71 this spring, which tightens record keeping requirements and other regulations for gun owners. But they say the government must go much farther, and that for too long Canada has compared itself to the U.S. instead of peers with similar restrictive gun cultures like the United Kingdom. “I think we are at a tipping point,” Dr. Ahmed says.

As groups have pushed for tighter gun laws, especially ahead of federal elections in October, gun advocates have pushed back in U.S.-style polarization around guns that is new for Canada.

Tracey Wilson, vice president of public relations for the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, says a mass shooting in the U.S. always gets intertwined with the situation at home, especially when sharing attention with Toronto violence. “It sort of triggers people to be afraid that the violence that we see here could increase to that level. And I think it's valid that they have concerns about that, because I think we all do,” she says. “However, you know all the evidence is extremely clear, and Canadians know it's not sport shooters and duck hunters running around the streets shooting people up.”

The CDPG – who criticize the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights for adopting NRA-style harassment tactics, which the coalition denies – say this takes away from the issue at hand. “There's a simple irrefutable fact, which is the less guns there are in the country the less deaths and injuries there are in the country from guns no matter where they're from,” says Philip Berger, the former chief of family and community medicine at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and a founder of the CDPG.

According to Statistics Canada, firearm-related crime has gone up by 42% since 2013. Each year since 2009, about six in ten firearm-related violent crimes involved handguns.

An opportunity for Mexico?

Mexico has seen an uptick in gun violence too. It recorded its highest homicide rate in history in 2018. Mexico's Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection released a report showing over 33,300 intentional homicides last year. That was a 15 percent increase over 2017, which previously held the record. The Center for American Progress study also shows an increase in recent years in guns used in homicides in Mexico.

But it’s the current political climate that could firm up the government’s pressure on the U.S. The current Mexican government has ceded to President Trump’s demands that it staunch the flow of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. or face tariffs. Mexican officials want to show the public that they can get something back.

And the El Paso shooting in particular – an attack in a Latino city that the Spanish newspaper El País called “greatest racist crime against Hispanics in modern United States history” – is a point of mobilization.

John Lindsay-Poland, a U.S.-based researcher and activist for stopping U.S. legal arms sales to Mexico, says it shifts attention among the Mexican public to the white nationalist threat that they face – and to focus attention on the gun politics that are changing in the U.S.

“The current of controlling guns and of preventing gun violence in the United States has grown enormously, so I do think there's a possible inflection point within the U.S. And for Mexicans I think that becomes an important piece because so many Mexicans are just resigned that things are never going to change,” he says. “But I think it is possible to achieve some changes that would be meaningful for Mexico and not just meaningful for the U.S.”

“They could begin to frame the violence in Mexico as around guns not, not just around criminal organizations, impunity, or drugs.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,j2T9fHhlOoeNZJNx

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/21/17028930/gun-violence-us-statistics-charts,I’ve covered gun violence for years. The solutions aren’t a big mystery.,2018-02-21,"German Lopez, Terry Nguyen, Nicole Narea, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Eric Johnson, Andrew Prokop","A year ago today , on February 14 , 2018 , a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , killed 17 people , and wounded 17 others . The shooting inspired a wave of activism , leading to the March for Our Lives in Washington , DC , and new activism for gun control around the 2018 midterm elections .
But since the Parkland shooting , Congress has taken no significant steps to address gun violence . And since Parkland , there have been nearly 350 mass shootings — nearly one every day — based on the Gun Violence Archive ’ s definition , which counts every event in which four or more people , excluding the shooter , were shot but not necessarily killed at the same general time and location .
We know what to do to stop this . But we aren ’ t doing it .
Since I began covering mass shootings at ███ , I ’ ve seen the same pattern play out again and again : A shooting happens . There are demands for action . Maybe something gets introduced in Congress . The debate goes back and forth for a bit . Then people move on — usually after a week or two ( although Parkland was an exception ) . Then , eventually , there ’ s another mass shooting , and the cycle begins anew .
I have become eerily attuned to this horrible American ritual . I even have my own version of it : Every time we get news of a mass shooting , I verify the reports , contribute to a “ what we know ” article , and then begin to update our old pieces on guns . Because nothing changes , everything we wrote in the past still applies ; all we have to change is the date , location , and number of dead .
I do this almost instinctively at this point — and that terrifies me . No one should get used to this .
As I see it , the core issue is that America collectively refuses to even admit it has a serious problem with guns and gun violence . Lawmakers continue acting like the solutions are some sort of mystery , as if there aren ’ t years of research and experiences in other countries that show restrictions on firearms can save lives .
Consider President Donald Trump ’ s initial speech in response to the Parkland shooting : His only mention of guns was a vague reference to “ gunfire ” as he described what happened . He never even brought up gun control or anything related to that debate , instead vaguely promising to work “ with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health . ”
This is America ’ s elected leader — and he essentially , based on his first public response , ignored what the real problem is . And although the White House eventually came around to bipartisan proposals to very slightly improve background checks and ban bump stocks , the compromises amount to fairly small changes to America ’ s weak gun laws .
In my coverage of these shootings , I ’ ve always focused on solutions through studies and policy ideas that would tamp down on the number of shootings . The good news is there are real solutions out there .
But America can ’ t get to those solutions until it admits it has a gun problem and confronts the reality of what it would mean to seriously address it .
The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns : It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations , and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world .
The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada , more than seven times that of Sweden , and nearly 16 times that of Germany , according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian . ( These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate , which includes non-gun deaths , than other developed nations . )
Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America ’ s gun deaths , constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016 . But America does see a lot of these horrific events : According to CNN , “ The US makes up less than 5 % of the world ’ s population , but holds 31 % of global mass shooters . ”
The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world . Estimated for 2017 , the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents , meaning there were more firearms than people . The world ’ s second-ranked country was Yemen , a quasi-failed state torn by civil war , where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents , according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey .
Another way of looking at that : Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world ’ s population , yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world ’ s privately held firearms .
These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related . The research , compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health ’ s Injury Control Research Center , is pretty clear : After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime , places with more guns have more gun deaths . Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides , but also with suicides ( which in recent years were around 60 percent of US gun deaths ) , domestic violence , and even violence against police .
For example , a 2013 study , led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher , found that , after controlling for multiple variables , each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate .
This chart , based on data from GunPolicy.org , shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) among wealthier nations :
Guns are not the only contributor to violence . ( Other factors include , for example , poverty , urbanization , and alcohol consumption . ) But when researchers control for other confounding variables , they have found time and time again that America ’ s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers .
Supporters of gun rights look at America ’ s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem . They point to other issues , from violence in video games and movies to the supposed breakdown of the traditional family .
Most recently , they ’ ve blamed mental health issues for mass shootings . This is the only policy issue that Trump mentioned in his first speech following the Florida shooting .
But as far as homicides go , people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims , not perpetrators , of violence . And Michael Stone , a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters , wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database , or about 22 percent , had mental illnesses . “ The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘ chief ’ perpetrators of mass murder , ” he concluded . Other research has backed this up .
More broadly , America does not have a monopoly on mental illness . That ’ s not to say more access to mental health care wouldn ’ t help ; it could , for example , be effective for reducing the number of gun suicides . But mental health issues aren ’ t what make the US stand out in terms of gun violence .
The problem that ’ s unique to the US , instead , is guns — and America ’ s abundance of them .
As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley ’ s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found , it ’ s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries . This chart , based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University , shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime :
Instead , the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that ’ s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns .
” A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar , ” Zimring and Hawkins wrote . “ A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London . ”
This is in many ways intuitive : People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends , family , and peers . But in the US , it ’ s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone .
The research also suggests that gun control can work . A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries , published in Epidemiologic Reviews , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives .
In 1996 , a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur , Australia , killing 35 people and wounding 23 more . It was the worst mass shooting in Australia ’ s history .
Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that , among other provisions , banned certain types of firearms , such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns . The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory buyback program , in which it purchased firearms from gun owners . It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases . ( This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US , which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country . )
Australia ’ s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed , and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent , according to a review of the evidence by Harvard researchers .
It ’ s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes . Australia ’ s gun deaths , for one , were already declining before the law passed . But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role : “ First , the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback . Second , firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates . ”
One study of the program , by Australian researchers , found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides . As Dylan Matthews explained for ███ , the drop in homicides wasn ’ t statistically significant because Australia already had a pretty low number of murders . But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking .
One other fact , noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011 : “ While 13 gun massacres ( the killing of 4 or more people at one time ) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [ Australia gun control law ] , resulting in more than one hundred deaths , in the 14 following years ( and up to the present ) , there were no gun massacres . ”
A common counterpoint to the evidence on gun control : If it works so well , why does Chicago have so much gun violence despite having some of the strictest gun policies in the US ?
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this argument after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting : “ I think if you look to Chicago , where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year , they have the strictest gun laws in the country . That certainly hasn ’ t helped there . ”
It ’ s true that Chicago has fairly strict gun laws ( although not the strictest ) . And it ’ s true that the city has fairly high levels of gun violence ( although also not the worst in the US ) .
This doesn ’ t , however , expose the failure of gun control altogether , but rather the limits of leaving gun policies to a patchwork of local and state laws . The basic problem : If a city or state passes strict gun control measures , people can simply cross a border to buy guns in a jurisdiction with laxer laws .
Chicago , for example , requires a Firearm Owners Identification card , a background check , a three-day waiting period , and documentation for all firearm sales . But Indiana , across the border , doesn ’ t require any of this for purchases between two private individuals ( including those at gun shows and those who meet through the internet ) , allowing even someone with a criminal record to buy a firearm without passing a background check or submitting paperwork recording the sale .
So someone from Chicago can drive across the border — to Indiana or to other places with lax gun laws — and buy a gun without any of the big legal hurdles he would face at home . Then that person can resell or give guns to others in Chicago , or keep them , leaving no paper trail behind . ( This is illegal trafficking under federal law , but Indiana ’ s lax laws and enforcement — particularly the lack of a paper trail — make it virtually impossible to catch someone until a gun is used in a crime . )
The result : According to a 2014 report from the Chicago Police Department , nearly 60 percent of the guns in crime scenes that were recovered and traced between 2009 and 2013 came from outside the state . About 19 percent came from Indiana — making it the most common state of origin for guns besides Illinois .
This isn ’ t exclusive to Chicago . A 2016 report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General found that 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York between 2010 and 2015 came from states with lax gun laws . ( The gun trafficking chain from Southern states with weak gun laws to New York is so well-known it even has a name : “ the Iron Pipeline. ” ) And another 2016 report from the US Government Accountability Office found that most of the guns — as many as 70 percent — used in crimes in Mexico , which has strict gun laws , can be traced back to the US , which has generally weaker gun laws .
That doesn ’ t mean the stricter gun laws in Chicago , New York , or any other jurisdiction have no effect , but it does limit how far these local and state measures can go , since the root of the problem lies in other places ’ laws . The only way the pipeline could be stopped would be if all states individually strengthened their gun laws at once — or , more realistically , if the federal government passed a law that enforces stricter rules across the US .
5 ) America probably needs to go further than anyone wants to admit
America ’ s attention to gun control often focuses on a few specific measures : universal background checks , restrictions on people with mental illnesses buying firearms , and an assault weapons ban , for example . It is rare that American politicians , even on the left , go much further than that . Something like Australia ’ s law — which amounts to a confiscation program — is never seriously considered .
As Matthews previously explained , this is a big issue . The US ’ s gun problem is so dire that it arguably needs solutions that go way further than what we typically see in mainstream proposals — at least , if the US ever hopes to get down to European levels of gun violence .
If the fundamental problem is that America has far too many guns , then policies need to cut the number of guns in circulation right now to seriously reduce the number of gun deaths . Background checks and other restrictions on who can buy a gun can ’ t achieve that in the short term . What America likely needs , then , is something more like Australia ’ s mandatory buyback program — essentially , a gun confiscation scheme — paired with a serious ban on specific firearms ( including , potentially , all semiautomatic weapons ) .
But no one in Congress is seriously proposing something that sweeping . The Manchin-Toomey bill , the only gun legislation in Congress after Sandy Hook that came close to becoming law , didn ’ t even establish universal background checks . Recent proposals have been even milder , taking small steps like banning bump stocks or slightly improving the existing system for background checks .
Part of the holdup is the Second Amendment . While there is reasonable scholarly debate about whether the Second Amendment actually protects all Americans ’ individual right to bear arms and prohibits stricter forms of gun control , the reality is the Supreme Court and US lawmakers — backed by the powerful gun lobby , particularly the NRA — widely agree that the Second Amendment does put barriers on how far restrictions can go . That would likely rule out anything like the Australian policy response short of a court reinterpretation or a repeal of the Second Amendment , neither of which seems likely .
So the US , for political , cultural , and legal reasons , seems to be unable to take the action that it really needs .
None of that is to say that milder measures are useless . Connecticut ’ s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license , for example , was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in handgun suicides . Similar results — in the reverse — were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law . It ’ s difficult to separate these changes from long-term trends ( especially since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now ) , but a review of the evidence by RAND linked milder gun control measures , including background checks , to reduced injuries and deaths — and that means these measures likely saved lives .
There are also some evidence-based policies that could help outside the realm of gun control , including more stringent regulations and taxes on alcohol , changes in policing , and behavioral intervention programs .
But if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report , it will likely need to go much , much further on guns in particular .","A year ago today, on February 14, 2018, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people, and wounded 17 others. The shooting inspired a wave of activism, leading to the March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, and new activism for gun control around the 2018 midterm elections.

But since the Parkland shooting, Congress has taken no significant steps to address gun violence. And since Parkland, there have been nearly 350 mass shootings — nearly one every day — based on the Gun Violence Archive’s definition, which counts every event in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, were shot but not necessarily killed at the same general time and location.

We know what to do to stop this. But we aren’t doing it.

Since I began covering mass shootings at Vox, I’ve seen the same pattern play out again and again: A shooting happens. There are demands for action. Maybe something gets introduced in Congress. The debate goes back and forth for a bit. Then people move on — usually after a week or two (although Parkland was an exception). Then, eventually, there’s another mass shooting, and the cycle begins anew.

I have become eerily attuned to this horrible American ritual. I even have my own version of it: Every time we get news of a mass shooting, I verify the reports, contribute to a “what we know” article, and then begin to update our old pieces on guns. Because nothing changes, everything we wrote in the past still applies; all we have to change is the date, location, and number of dead.

I do this almost instinctively at this point — and that terrifies me. No one should get used to this.

As I see it, the core issue is that America collectively refuses to even admit it has a serious problem with guns and gun violence. Lawmakers continue acting like the solutions are some sort of mystery, as if there aren’t years of research and experiences in other countries that show restrictions on firearms can save lives.

Consider President Donald Trump’s initial speech in response to the Parkland shooting: His only mention of guns was a vague reference to “gunfire” as he described what happened. He never even brought up gun control or anything related to that debate, instead vaguely promising to work “with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.”

This is America’s elected leader — and he essentially, based on his first public response, ignored what the real problem is. And although the White House eventually came around to bipartisan proposals to very slightly improve background checks and ban bump stocks, the compromises amount to fairly small changes to America’s weak gun laws.

In my coverage of these shootings, I’ve always focused on solutions through studies and policy ideas that would tamp down on the number of shootings. The good news is there are real solutions out there.

But America can’t get to those solutions until it admits it has a gun problem and confronts the reality of what it would mean to seriously address it.

1) America has a unique gun violence problem

The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world.

The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)

Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.”

The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey.

Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms.

These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides, but also with suicides (which in recent years were around 60 percent of US gun deaths), domestic violence, and even violence against police.

For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.

This chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) among wealthier nations:

Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.

2) The problem is guns, not mental illness

Supporters of gun rights look at America’s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem. They point to other issues, from violence in video games and movies to the supposed breakdown of the traditional family.

Most recently, they’ve blamed mental health issues for mass shootings. This is the only policy issue that Trump mentioned in his first speech following the Florida shooting.

But as far as homicides go, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had mental illnesses. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” he concluded. Other research has backed this up.

More broadly, America does not have a monopoly on mental illness. That’s not to say more access to mental health care wouldn’t help; it could, for example, be effective for reducing the number of gun suicides. But mental health issues aren’t what make the US stand out in terms of gun violence.

The governor gave the invitation at a press conference held with Liberty University President Jerry Falwell , Jr. at a community college in Martinsburg , West Virginia on Tuesday .
`` If you 're not happy where you 're at , come on down , '' Justice said . `` If you 're not truly happy where you are , we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere you may be . We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment , and we stand strongly for the unborn . ''
Many Virginians are not `` happy '' since last fall when , for the first time in more than 20 years , Virginia Democrats regained full control of the government in Richmond . Since taking office this month , they 've set to work dismantling laws protecting the rights of gun owners , and as ███ News has reported , removing restrictions on abortion designed to protect the unborn and their mothers . The Wall Street Journal reports , too , they are proposing to repeal the state 's 70-year old right-to-work law which would force workers to join a union , force them to pay dues and deny them the long-held freedom to choose whether to be part of a union or not .
Thousands of gun owners concerned about their freedom gathered for a rally on the Capitol grounds in Richmond on January 20th to lobby against the proposed legislation , part of which if signed into law , would have made many of them felons overnight due to the kind of weapons they owned . Fearing the loss of their freedoms , in the months since the election , citizens have flooded city council meetings all over the Old Dominion , resulting in some 91 of Virginia 's 95 counties declaring themselves Second Amendment Sanctuaries . They have issued statements affirming their support for the Second Amendment , with some declaring they will refuse to enforce gun laws that go against it .
Oddly enough , the idea of Virginia counties seceding to another state is not a new one . In 1863 , West Virginia became a state formed from western counties of Virginia that opposed Virginia 's decision to secede from the United States . In fact , West Virginia is the only state created by seceding from a Confederate state .
Asked for a reaction to West Virginia 's proposal that Virginia counties join their state , Virginia Democrat Governor Ralph Northam 's office responded it `` sounds like it 's an election year in West Virginia , '' The Hill reports . Virginia Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw ( D ) , who at one point had called for a ban on so-called assault weapons in the Commonwealth , described the secession proposal `` preposterous , '' saying West Virginia should focus on fixing its high poverty rate .
Minority leader in the House of Delegates , Todd Gilbert , told ███ News many Virginians all across the state are not happy with the Democrat agenda , but Republicans , he said , are not even close to retreating from the political fray in Richmond , even though he did seem to appreciate West Virginia 's offer .
`` We 're nowhere near done fighting for our values here in the Commonwealth . Democrats have been in power for less than two months and they 're already raising taxes , working to let violent felons out of jail early , and punishing law-abiding gun owners . We think Virginians will have a significant case of buyer 's remorse very soon . That being said , it 's always nice to have options . ''
But concern by Virginia conservatives over the leftist tilt of their state government is not going away .
`` What 's happening in Virginia right now is a tragedy in the making , '' said Falwell . `` Democrat leaders in Richmond , through their elitism and radicalism , have left a nearly unrecognizable state in their wake , and they are using their power to strip away the God-given rights held by every person in the state , despite their due protections under the US Constitution . ''
So could it really happen that what is now part of Virginia could become a new part of West Virginia ? According to Fox News , Falwell said lawyers he had consulted said even if Virginians wanted to , secession would be a very difficult process . Virginia counties would need to conduct petition drives , followed by a referendum . If successful , the proposal then would go before the Virginia General Assembly . University of Virginia law professor Richard Schragger told the Times-Dispatch the move was `` certainly a long shot , '' and would require the consent of Congress and both states .
For their part , lawmakers in West Virginia already have introduced formal resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join their state .
What is clearly evident , Virginians worried about the direction of their state may not want to secede , but if attendance at city council meetings is any gauge , more and more of them are getting involved in fighting against what they see as a shocking erosion of their freedom .","In a proposal the Richmond Times-Dispatch has dubbed ""Vexit,"" West Virginia's Republican Governor Jim Justice invited Virginia counties upset over the liberal government in their state capital to secede to West Virginia. The governor gave the invitation at a press conference held with Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. at a community college in Martinsburg, West Virginia on Tuesday.

Many Virginians are not ""happy"" since last fall when, for the first time in more than 20 years, Virginia Democrats regained full control of the government in Richmond. Since taking office this month, they've set to work dismantling laws protecting the rights of gun owners, and as CBN News has reported, removing restrictions on abortion designed to protect the unborn and their mothers. The Wall Street Journal reports, too, they are proposing to repeal the state's 70-year old right-to-work law which would force workers to join a union, force them to pay dues and deny them the long-held freedom to choose whether to be part of a union or not.



Thousands of gun owners concerned about their freedom gathered for a rally on the Capitol grounds in Richmond on January 20th to lobby against the proposed legislation, part of which if signed into law, would have made many of them felons overnight due to the kind of weapons they owned. Fearing the loss of their freedoms, in the months since the election, citizens have flooded city council meetings all over the Old Dominion, resulting in some 91 of Virginia's 95 counties declaring themselves Second Amendment Sanctuaries. They have issued statements affirming their support for the Second Amendment, with some declaring they will refuse to enforce gun laws that go against it.

Oddly enough, the idea of Virginia counties seceding to another state is not a new one. In 1863, West Virginia became a state formed from western counties of Virginia that opposed Virginia's decision to secede from the United States. In fact, West Virginia is the only state created by seceding from a Confederate state.

Asked for a reaction to West Virginia's proposal that Virginia counties join their state, Virginia Democrat Governor Ralph Northam's office responded it ""sounds like it's an election year in West Virginia,"" The Hill reports. Virginia Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw (D), who at one point had called for a ban on so-called assault weapons in the Commonwealth, described the secession proposal ""preposterous,"" saying West Virginia should focus on fixing its high poverty rate.

Minority leader in the House of Delegates, Todd Gilbert, told CBN News many Virginians all across the state are not happy with the Democrat agenda, but Republicans, he said, are not even close to retreating from the political fray in Richmond, even though he did seem to appreciate West Virginia's offer.

""We're nowhere near done fighting for our values here in the Commonwealth. Democrats have been in power for less than two months and they're already raising taxes, working to let violent felons out of jail early, and punishing law-abiding gun owners. We think Virginians will have a significant case of buyer's remorse very soon. That being said, it's always nice to have options.""

But concern by Virginia conservatives over the leftist tilt of their state government is not going away.

""What's happening in Virginia right now is a tragedy in the making,"" said Falwell. ""Democrat leaders in Richmond, through their elitism and radicalism, have left a nearly unrecognizable state in their wake, and they are using their power to strip away the God-given rights held by every person in the state, despite their due protections under the US Constitution.""

So could it really happen that what is now part of Virginia could become a new part of West Virginia? According to Fox News, Falwell said lawyers he had consulted said even if Virginians wanted to, secession would be a very difficult process. Virginia counties would need to conduct petition drives, followed by a referendum. If successful, the proposal then would go before the Virginia General Assembly. University of Virginia law professor Richard Schragger told the Times-Dispatch the move was ""certainly a long shot,"" and would require the consent of Congress and both states.

For their part, lawmakers in West Virginia already have introduced formal resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join their state.

What is clearly evident, Virginians worried about the direction of their state may not want to secede, but if attendance at city council meetings is any gauge, more and more of them are getting involved in fighting against what they see as a shocking erosion of their freedom.",www1.cbn.com,right,CQ3mThaF2IG4kvQZ

On the one hand , gun control advocates called for closing loopholes and tightening background checks in the aftermath of the mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs , Texas , that left 26 dead and 20 wounded .
On the other hand , Second Amendment supporters argued that the Air Force ’ s mistake comes as another example of gun control measures failing to stop mass shootings , even as a former National Rifle Association instructor was able to stop Kelley .
“ No amount of top-down gun control is going to stop a determined killer — whether it ’ s from human error or from killers stealing their weapons , ” said Gun Owners of America spokesman Jordan Stein . “ The Sandy Hook shooter in Connecticut stole his AR-15 . So did the Clackamas mall shooter in Oregon . ”
Mr. Stein added , “ What actually stops an evil psychopath is what we saw on Sunday — a good guy with a gun . ”
The Air Force announced it would undertake a “ comprehensive review ” of its handling of criminal records after discovering that Holloman Air Force Base officials failed to report to the federal database Kelley ’ s 2012 court-martial and conviction on two counts of domestic assault .

The now-deceased 26-year-old gunman was able to obtain multiple firearms legally after passing background checks despite his history of abusing his ex-wife and stepson , which resulted in a 12-month sentence after he pleaded guilty .
“ Initial information indicates that Kelley ’ s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Hollomon Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations , ” the USAF said in a statement .
USAF spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein directed the Air Force office of the inspector general to conduct the review .
“ The Service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly , ” said the statement . “ The Air Force has also requested that the Department of Defense Inspector General review records and procedures across the Department of Defense . ”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called Monday for increasing security at churches or encouraging qualified parishioners to carry firearms .
“ It ’ s going to happen again , and so we need people in churches — professional security or at least arming some of the parishioners or the congregation so they can respond when something like this happens again , ” Mr. Paxton told Fox News .
Shannon Watts , president of Moms Demand Action , said the reporting system needs improvements . She argued that the “ background checks system is only as good as the records in it ; any missing record can enable a tragedy , as in this case . ”
“ That ’ s why we work to close loopholes , and fight @ NRA agenda to make it easier for domestic abusers and violent criminals to get guns , ” Ms. Watts said on Twitter .
A prominent senator demanded that the Pentagon go back and review all its disciplinary records and update the gun background check system .
Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand said the Defense Department needs to familiarize itself with what records it ’ s required to turn over , then go look back through the last decade ’ s worth of investigations and cases to see who should be listed but isn ’ t .
“ If this can happen in one case , it could happen in others , ” the New York Democrat said in a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis .
Authorities said Kelley had purchased four firearms — one per year in 2014 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 — while Academy Sports & Outdoors said he bought two guns from its two San Antonio locations in 2016 and 2017 .
“ Based on information we received from law enforcement , we confirmed that the suspect purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations , one in 2016 and one in 2017 , ” said a company statement . “ We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further . ”
One of the weapons , a Ruger AR-556 rifle , was used in the attack on the church .
Kelley left the military in 2014 after receiving a “ bad conduct discharge . ”
Those convicted of domestic violence or receiving a dishonorable discharge from the military — which is not the same as a bad conduct discharge — are prohibited under federal law from purchasing firearms .
Kelley , who lived in nearby New Braunfels , was involved in a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law , a regular First Baptist attendee who was not among the victims , according to Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin .
“ We can tell you that there was a domestic situation going on within his family , ” said Mr. Martin at a press conference . “ The suspect ’ s mother-in-law attended this church . We know she had received threatening texts from him . ”
But the hero Sunday — Stephen Willeford , a plumber and former NRA instructor — told 40/29 News that he grabbed his rifle and ran to the church after hearing shots , firing at the suspect as he exited and hitting him twice .
“ I think my God , my Lord , protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done , and I just wish I could have gotten there faster , ” Mr. Willeford said .
The gunman fled in his Ford Expedition , chased by Mr. Willeford and another man , but veered off the road a short time later . Authorities said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Those killed ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years , while the injured ranged from 5 to 73 , Mr. Martin said at a press conference .
Sherri Pomeroy , wife of the First Baptist Church pastor , lost her 14-year-old daughter , Annabelle , in the shooting but said that “ one thing that gives me a sliver of encouragement is the fact that Belle was surrounded yesterday by her church family who she loved fiercely , and vice versa . ”
The Pomeroy parents were out of town during the shooting .","The Air Force launched a review Monday after admitting that it had blundered by failing to submit Devin Patrick Kelley’s criminal history to the FBI background check system, thus providing ammunition to both sides of the gun control debate.

On the one hand, gun control advocates called for closing loopholes and tightening background checks in the aftermath of the mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 dead and 20 wounded.

On the other hand, Second Amendment supporters argued that the Air Force’s mistake comes as another example of gun control measures failing to stop mass shootings, even as a former National Rifle Association instructor was able to stop Kelley.

“No amount of top-down gun control is going to stop a determined killer — whether it’s from human error or from killers stealing their weapons,” said Gun Owners of America spokesman Jordan Stein. “The Sandy Hook shooter in Connecticut stole his AR-15. So did the Clackamas mall shooter in Oregon.”

Mr. Stein added, “What actually stops an evil psychopath is what we saw on Sunday — a good guy with a gun.”

The Air Force announced it would undertake a “comprehensive review” of its handling of criminal records after discovering that Holloman Air Force Base officials failed to report to the federal database Kelley’s 2012 court-martial and conviction on two counts of domestic assault.

The now-deceased 26-year-old gunman was able to obtain multiple firearms legally after passing background checks despite his history of abusing his ex-wife and stepson, which resulted in a 12-month sentence after he pleaded guilty.

“Initial information indicates that Kelley’s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Hollomon Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations,” the USAF said in a statement.

USAF spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein directed the Air Force office of the inspector general to conduct the review.

“The Service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly,” said the statement. “The Air Force has also requested that the Department of Defense Inspector General review records and procedures across the Department of Defense.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called Monday for increasing security at churches or encouraging qualified parishioners to carry firearms.

“It’s going to happen again, and so we need people in churches — professional security or at least arming some of the parishioners or the congregation so they can respond when something like this happens again,” Mr. Paxton told Fox News.

Shannon Watts, president of Moms Demand Action, said the reporting system needs improvements. She argued that the “background checks system is only as good as the records in it; any missing record can enable a tragedy, as in this case.”

“That’s why we work to close loopholes, and fight @NRA agenda to make it easier for domestic abusers and violent criminals to get guns,” Ms. Watts said on Twitter.

A prominent senator demanded that the Pentagon go back and review all its disciplinary records and update the gun background check system.

Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand said the Defense Department needs to familiarize itself with what records it’s required to turn over, then go look back through the last decade’s worth of investigations and cases to see who should be listed but isn’t.

“If this can happen in one case, it could happen in others,” the New York Democrat said in a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis.

Authorities said Kelley had purchased four firearms — one per year in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 — while Academy Sports & Outdoors said he bought two guns from its two San Antonio locations in 2016 and 2017.

“Based on information we received from law enforcement, we confirmed that the suspect purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations, one in 2016 and one in 2017,” said a company statement. “We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further.”

One of the weapons, a Ruger AR-556 rifle, was used in the attack on the church.

Kelley left the military in 2014 after receiving a “bad conduct discharge.”

Those convicted of domestic violence or receiving a dishonorable discharge from the military — which is not the same as a bad conduct discharge — are prohibited under federal law from purchasing firearms.

Kelley, who lived in nearby New Braunfels, was involved in a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a regular First Baptist attendee who was not among the victims, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin.

The gunman fled in his Ford Expedition, chased by Mr. Willeford and another man, but veered off the road a short time later. Authorities said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Those killed ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years, while the injured ranged from 5 to 73, Mr. Martin said at a press conference.

New York City Mayor Michael R.

That’s why he has had to resort to policing tactics such as stop and frisk to get the firearms away from the bad guys.

However, the organizers of the march claim it is not political.

“School safety is not a political issue,” a mission statement on the organization’s website reads. “There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing.”

The White House told Fox News in a statement: ""We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the President's, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix NICS [National Instant Criminal Background Check System] and STOP School Violence Acts, and signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the President¹s commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.""

Friend,

When tragedy struck Sandy Hook Elementary School last year, we mourned together as a nation.

As we approach the anniversary on December 14th, communities are coming together to reflect and stand as one with the families of Newtown, Connecticut.

Right now, we're looking for supporters to host remembrance events in their community -- if you're interested, you can sign up today.

OFA will give you the resources you need to ensure your events is a powerful reminder of what we lost a year ago, and a reminder that we as a nation need to do more to prevent gun violence and to keep our communities safe.

Newtown green ribbons will be distributed that day -- both in person and online -- to help show solidarity with the families of Sandy Hook.

If you'd like to host a Newtown anniversary event, all you have to do is sign up here to get started.

And we'll be in touch soon with more information.

Thanks.



When you go to the events page, this is the text you will find.

By hosting a Newtown Anniversary event, you are joining thousands of Americans across the country as we remember the tragic events that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School one year ago. Supporters will be gathering at events in communities across the country, with partner organizations, to pay tribute to the 26 victims and call on Congress to finally take action to make our communities safer.



Create your event today by filling out the fields below. We'll contact you with details about our Gun Violence Prevention campaign and provide training, tools, and information to make your event on December 14th a success.

Never let a good crisis go to waste, even if it means dancing on the graves of children.

But this isn't just isolated to OFA, an email from Vice President Joe Biden was sent out through WhiteHouse.gov late last night and surprise, it's about President Obama's gun control executive orders, the need for more gun control and Newtown.

Twenty years ago, President Clinton signed the Brady Bill into law.



That law said that if you want to purchase a firearm from a federally licensed dealer in this country, you have to get a background check first. It was a historic piece of legislation -- one that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a firearm in the last 14 years.



But in the wake of the tragedy in Newtown -- a year ago this month -- we know we've got to keep working to build on that progress.



And so even after a minority of Senators blocked commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence this spring, we're pushing forward.



President Obama laid out 23 executive actions to make sure the Administration took essential and rapid steps to save lives while respecting our Second Amendment rights. And since January, we've completed or made significant progress on all of them.



President Obama is keeping his word to make sure our families and communities are safe. See the progress we've made.



Those 23 executive actions are keeping guns out of dangerous hands. They're providing support for communities to hire school resource officers. And they're reducing the stigma around mental illness.



Now, it's not enough to take these steps on our own -- we still need Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to reduce gun violence. We need expanded background checks, and we need to create serious penalties for gun trafficking. There is no question that these kinds of measures would protect our kids and keep our communities safer.



No parent should ever face the horror of the scene at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Or a movie theater in Aurora. Or a temple in Oak Creek. Or the campus at Virginia Tech.



We've seen too much gun violence as a country. And if there's even one thing we can do to save a life, it is our most sacred duty to try.



That's where I stand. And you have my word that the President and I are doing everything we can to make sure no parent loses their child to gun violence.



Take a look at the progress we've made:

Thank you,



Joe

As a reminder, none of the ""common sense"" gun control measures Vice President Biden and OFA mention in their emails would have prevented Newtown, or any of the other tragedies Democrats are trying to turn a profit on. These incidents had absolutely nothing to do with gun trafficking or universal background checks as Vice President Biden suggests. And about those ""serious penalties for gun trafficking,"" those penalties are already on the books, but they aren't enforced. Further, under President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's leadership, prosecutions of gun related crimes are down by 45 percent.

Earlier in the year, to the dismay of the usual suspects, Texas governor Greg Abbott had signed a bill making it explicitly legal for Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship. These kinds of protections allowed Wilson to achieve something that no gun laws now being pursued nationally by Democrats has ever accomplished: He stopped a mass shooter. My guess is that Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, is the kind of guy who probably wouldn’t have broken the law and carried a firearm into church had it been illegal to do so. The killer, on the other hand, I’m wholly certain, would have been undeterred by any laws.

Yet allowing people who pass ongoing criminal-background checks and take state-mandated training courses to bring their guns to a church or a school is a move that generates tremendous hostility among gun-control advocates. We must “do something” about gun violence, but we’ve learned that, in the liberal vernacular, that’s nothing more than a euphemism for “do something to inhibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns.”

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/15/concealed-carry-gun-reciprocity-2014-bill-senate/,"Gun rights reload in 2014, concealed carry reciprocity back in Congress",2014-01-15,Emily Miller,"While 2013 was a year of Second Amendment advocates on defense , 2014 is lining up to be a year of gaining ground on gun rights .
President Obama continues to issue his dictates . Michael R. Bloomberg is still throwing around millions of dollars . And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is just keeping a finger in the dike on Capitol Hill until the midterms .
But the American people are ready to get back to strengthening their rights to keep and bear arms .
On Monday , Sen. John Cornyn introduced the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act , which is the first pro-gun legislation leveled since the showdown over Mr. Obama ’ s gun control votes last April .
“ It strikes me that , at a time we ’ re talking about the role of guns in society , we should acknowledge that it is a constitutional right , ” the Texas Republican told me in an interview Wednesday . “ Law-abiding people buy and use guns for legitimate purposes , protecting themselves and their families . ”
He added that the iron is hot since Illinois became the 50th state to allow for concealed carry , after being forced by the federal courts in 2013 to rewrite its laws .
Anti-gun activists have attempted to make Mr. Cornyn ’ s bill seem extremist .
“ There ’ s some scaremongering going on out there , but it ’ s pretty straightforward , ” he said . “ It ’ s like a driver ’ s license . It doesn ’ t trump state laws . Say you have a carry permit in Texas ; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law . ”
This popular , common-sense legislation is necessary because the current system is totally convoluted . Each state decides which permits from other states it recognizes as lawful , and some recognize none .
Gun owners are stuck doing extensive legal research to travel , but they can still get caught in the thicket . Mr. Cornyn said , “ There are some jurisdictions like to play ‘ gotcha . ’ ”
That is exactly what just happened over New Year ’ s when Maryland police held a Florida man at a traffic stop for three hours to search his car because records showed he had a carry permit . John Filippidis didn ’ t even bring his gun when he drove his wife to a family wedding in New Jersey .
But Mr. Filippidis told The Tampa Bay Tribune that he was treated “ like a criminal ” in anti-gun Maryland for having a gun permit , and he wasn ’ t even cited for a traffic violation .
Mr. Cornyn is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is the first hurdle to a floor vote . ( The House passed this legislation in 2011 . )
Mr. Cornyn last brought up the bill in April as an amendment to “ Manchin-Toomey , ” which was a legislative vehicle for Mr. Obama ’ s gun grab . While the president ’ s agenda only got 52 of the 60 votes needed for passage , concealed carry got 57 votes .
With many Democrats in rural or Western states up for re-election in 2014 , Mr. Reid will have to revert to his current dictatorial tactics to prevent getting concealed carry to a vote and possibly passing .
The Democratic leader has allowed only four roll-call votes on Republican amendments since July .
The voters ’ support for the Second Amendment has become so important again that Mr. Cornyn ’ s most well-known primary opponent — of seven — is trying to outgun him in the campaign .
Rep. Steve Stockman has touted his endorsement from Gun Owners of America and sent out repeated press releases attacking Mr. Cornyn ’ s record on firearms rights .
Last week , Mr. Stockman put out a statement that said Mr. Cornyn had “ opened a new front in the Left ’ s War on Guns. ” The Texas Republican congressman wrote that a bill on access to firearms for the mentally ill is “ nearly identical to Barack Obama ’ s latest Executive Order . ”
An amused Mr. Cornyn responded , “ He must be clairvoyant because the bill hasn ’ t been written yet . ”
Mr. Stockman ’ s spokesman , Don Ferguson , explained , “ The federal NICS gun-owner database was part of the anti-gun Brady Bill , and any proposal to expand it is another attack on gun rights . ”
He added , “ No wonder John Cornyn told Texas Monthly , ‘ I ’ m not sure what the point is about open carry . ’ ”
Mr. Cornyn said , “ Part of what goes along with running for office is , people will misrepresent and lie about your record , and mine is rock solid . ”
The National Rifle Association endorsed the senator for the March 4 primary and gives him an A+ rating .
Gun Owners of America lowered Mr. Cornyn ’ s rating from an A+ in November to a B in December .
The group ’ s founder , Larry Pratt , told me in an interview Wednesday that the reduction was a result of the Texas senator ’ s opposition to fellow Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ’ s filibuster over defunding Obamacare back in October .
“ This massive privacy invasion on veterans ’ psychiatric records will be used as a predicate to grabbing their guns , ” Mr. Pratt said of the health care law . “ We think it is pretty major because it ’ s a backdoor issue that has to be explained , and already there ’ s knocking on doors . ”
Mr. Cornyn would only say that the rating drop “ sounds like politics to me . ”
Mr. Pratt explained that his organization is backing Mr. Stockman because he “ enjoys fighting ” and is an “ activist like Cruz who gets out of bed thinking , ‘ Which liberal head can I make explode today ? ’ ”
In a recent poll by Wilson Perkins Allen in Texas , Mr. Cornyn had 50 percent of GOP support , while Mr. Stockman had just 6 percent .
Nevertheless , the fact that a congressman is trying to outgun a sitting senator with an impeccable record shows how important the issue is in the nation ’ s second-largest state .
The resurrection of proactive Second Amendment policy and politics shows that the American people will not be cowed by a New York City billionaire or a president who is totally out of touch with their views on the right to keep and bear arms .

While 2013 was a year of Second Amendment advocates on defense, 2014 is lining up to be a year of gaining ground on gun rights.

President Obama continues to issue his dictates. Michael R. Bloomberg is still throwing around millions of dollars. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is just keeping a finger in the dike on Capitol Hill until the midterms.

But the American people are ready to get back to strengthening their rights to keep and bear arms.

On Monday, Sen. John Cornyn introduced the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which is the first pro-gun legislation leveled since the showdown over Mr. Obama’s gun control votes last April.

“It strikes me that, at a time we’re talking about the role of guns in society, we should acknowledge that it is a constitutional right,” the Texas Republican told me in an interview Wednesday. “Law-abiding people buy and use guns for legitimate purposes, protecting themselves and their families.”

He added that the iron is hot since Illinois became the 50th state to allow for concealed carry, after being forced by the federal courts in 2013 to rewrite its laws.

Anti-gun activists have attempted to make Mr. Cornyn’s bill seem extremist.

“There’s some scaremongering going on out there, but it’s pretty straightforward,” he said. “It’s like a driver’s license. It doesn’t trump state laws. Say you have a carry permit in Texas; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law.”

This popular, common-sense legislation is necessary because the current system is totally convoluted. Each state decides which permits from other states it recognizes as lawful, and some recognize none.

Gun owners are stuck doing extensive legal research to travel, but they can still get caught in the thicket. Mr. Cornyn said, “There are some jurisdictions like to play ‘gotcha.’”

That is exactly what just happened over New Year’s when Maryland police held a Florida man at a traffic stop for three hours to search his car because records showed he had a carry permit. John Filippidis didn’t even bring his gun when he drove his wife to a family wedding in New Jersey.

But Mr. Filippidis told The Tampa Bay Tribune that he was treated “like a criminal” in anti-gun Maryland for having a gun permit, and he wasn’t even cited for a traffic violation.

Mr. Cornyn is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is the first hurdle to a floor vote. (The House passed this legislation in 2011.)

Mr. Cornyn last brought up the bill in April as an amendment to “Manchin-Toomey,” which was a legislative vehicle for Mr. Obama’s gun grab. While the president’s agenda only got 52 of the 60 votes needed for passage, concealed carry got 57 votes.

With many Democrats in rural or Western states up for re-election in 2014, Mr. Reid will have to revert to his current dictatorial tactics to prevent getting concealed carry to a vote and possibly passing.

The Democratic leader has allowed only four roll-call votes on Republican amendments since July.

The voters’ support for the Second Amendment has become so important again that Mr. Cornyn’s most well-known primary opponent — of seven — is trying to outgun him in the campaign.

Rep. Steve Stockman has touted his endorsement from Gun Owners of America and sent out repeated press releases attacking Mr. Cornyn’s record on firearms rights.

Last week, Mr. Stockman put out a statement that said Mr. Cornyn had “opened a new front in the Left’s War on Guns.” The Texas Republican congressman wrote that a bill on access to firearms for the mentally ill is “nearly identical to Barack Obama’s latest Executive Order.”

An amused Mr. Cornyn responded, “He must be clairvoyant because the bill hasn’t been written yet.”

Mr. Stockman’s spokesman, Don Ferguson, explained, “The federal NICS gun-owner database was part of the anti-gun Brady Bill, and any proposal to expand it is another attack on gun rights.”

He added, “No wonder John Cornyn told Texas Monthly, ‘I’m not sure what the point is about open carry.’”

Mr. Cornyn said, “Part of what goes along with running for office is, people will misrepresent and lie about your record, and mine is rock solid.”

The National Rifle Association endorsed the senator for the March 4 primary and gives him an A+ rating.

Gun Owners of America lowered Mr. Cornyn’s rating from an A+ in November to a B in December.

The group’s founder, Larry Pratt, told me in an interview Wednesday that the reduction was a result of the Texas senator’s opposition to fellow Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s filibuster over defunding Obamacare back in October.

“This massive privacy invasion on veterans’ psychiatric records will be used as a predicate to grabbing their guns,” Mr. Pratt said of the health care law. “We think it is pretty major because it’s a backdoor issue that has to be explained, and already there’s knocking on doors.”

Mr. Cornyn would only say that the rating drop “sounds like politics to me.”

Mr. Pratt explained that his organization is backing Mr. Stockman because he “enjoys fighting” and is an “activist like Cruz who gets out of bed thinking, ‘Which liberal head can I make explode today?’”

In a recent poll by Wilson Perkins Allen in Texas, Mr. Cornyn had 50 percent of GOP support, while Mr. Stockman had just 6 percent.

Nevertheless, the fact that a congressman is trying to outgun a sitting senator with an impeccable record shows how important the issue is in the nation’s second-largest state.

The resurrection of proactive Second Amendment policy and politics shows that the American people will not be cowed by a New York City billionaire or a president who is totally out of touch with their views on the right to keep and bear arms.

Out is an immediate public push for legislation in Congress, with all the accompanying flashy public events. In is a series of local events across the country and painstakingly building a political infrastructure able to compete with the National Rifle Association.

Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which organized a successful campaign this summer to pressure Starbucks into banning guns from its cafes, is preparing a similar effort aimed at McDonald’s, founder Shannon Watts told POLITICO.

It’s part of the larger political shift from gun control advocacy groups , and a recognition that, like much of Obama’s second-term agenda, gun control is buried under the reality of a divided Congress.

Saturday’s anniversary wasn’t a big political moment in D.C. The Newtown families asked the White House and major gun control organizations not to make a big political production out of Saturday’s anniversary, preferring to maintain it as a solemn remembrance.

( PHOTOS: Politicians with guns)

Obama, for instance, marked the massacre’s anniversary not with a visit to Connecticut or even Saturday’s National Cathedral memorial service but with a private moment of silence at the White House.

“There’s no question that Congress failed to do the right thing,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. “And in the end, there’s a limit on what a president can do. Other actions require congressional movement.”

News of the nation’s latest school shooting, which left a Colorado shooter dead and a classmate in critical condition on Friday, didn’t come as a great shock. The White House released a perfunctory statement saying Obama was briefed about the situation and that federal officials remain in touch with their local law enforcement counterparts.

Gun control advocates say they’ve learned the political lessons from the Newtown shooting, where the Senate waited four months to vote on background check legislation. Not only did they lose momentum and give the NRA a chance to rally its supporters, but the 20 years of inaction on gun control meant lawmakers were not well-versed on the issue.

“The infrastructure just wasn’t there to turn it around quickly — the knowledge wasn’t there among Hill staff, among members of Congress who hadn’t voted on it for a decade,” said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, the director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a centrist think tank. “Now all of us know a heck of a lot more about this. We won’t need to take so much time to figure that out. If there is a tragedy that specifically involves one of the policies we’re talking about, were going to see more swift action.”

Last year when Obama returned to Washington after speaking at the Newtown memorial service , Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, was the first gun control activist to get a White House meeting. That was in part because he was the only game in town.

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords’s Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Sandy Hook Promise and Moms Demand Action have all formed this year. The post-Obama campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action launched in January with gun violence prevention as one of its four main policy areas.

OFA solicited its members recently to host Newtown anniversary vigils but said it was not using the date to make a policy push; volunteers were simply “coming together in their communities in remembrance of the tragic events in Newtown a year ago,” a spokesman said.

The low-key events were meant to keep activists engaged and lawmakers from forgetting the issue. They are also planning for the midterm elections while doing the macabre job of preparing a response for what they see as the inevitability of the next mass shooting while at the same time making the fight as much cultural as political.

“I hope there’s not a next time, but if there is, we’ve laid the groundwork; we’ve got momentum across the country,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats’ gun violence task force.

On the forefront of this effort is Shannon Watts, a spunky Indiana woman and political neophyte who started Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America as a Facebook group after the Newtown massacre. Now Watts, a mother and stepmother of five, is the head of an organization vying to become the MADD of gun control.

Watts hopes to make background checks a women’s issue the same way abortion rights are — something candidates, particularly Democrats, are forced to forcefully support. The McDonald’s campaign, coming off the successful Starbucks effort, won’t be the last.

Now , in the wake of the Newtown school massacre and the President ’ s January 16 promise to “ put everything I ’ ve got ” into a sweeping new series of gun control initiatives , the fate of that treaty , which enters a “ final ” round of negotiations this March , may loom as more important than ever , according to critics , some of whom argue that the U.S. should never have entered the talks in the first place .
Their concerns remain , despite the fact that President Obama repeated his support for the Second Amendment and “ our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen ” on January 16 . ( The subject never came up in his second inaugural address . )
U.S. diplomats have declined a ███ request to discuss , among other things , the direction of the talks , and whether the other 192 countries involved respect that U.S. “ red lines ” in the negotiations—including the Administration ’ s assertion that “ the Second Amendment to the Constitution must be upheld ” —are truly inviolate .
The Administration first agreed to take part in the U.N. arms treaty negotiations in 2009—the same year in which it launched the now-notorious Fast and Furious operation , which provided weapons to illicit gun traders , ostensibly to track gun-running operations to Mexican drug cartels . Those negotiations proceeded irregularly , but seemed to founder last July .
But then , the U.S. joined a 157-0 vote , with 18 abstentions , of a U.N. General Assembly disarmament committee , on November 7 , 2012 , —the day after President Barack Obama won his second-term victory -- to create the March round of talks . ( A State Department official insisted to ███ that the vote only came after the U.S. elections due to the disruption caused by Hurricane Sandy ; otherwise , it would have taken place earlier . )
Amid the fog surrounding the treaty process , however , one thing seemed clear : an issue that deeply involves American rights and freedoms is back on the table , linked to the lingering problem of how to keep conventional military weapons out of the hands of terrorists and extremists . The State Department itself , on a web page that also lists its “ red line ” reservations in the negotiations , calls it a “ complex but critical issue . ”
For many critics , however , the draft version of the treaty is also a mine field of clauses and propositions that mandate a much greater federal role in U.S. gun sales , and potentially tie the U.S. to the gun control agenda of other governments or regimes .
“ The treaty is drafted as if every nation in the world has centralized control of the arms industry and arms sales , which is not the case here , ” said Ted Bromund , a security policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has followed the arms trade treaty process closely , and who believes the U.S. should bail out of the March treaty talks .
“ We ’ ve already got an enormous body of statutes and practice on the import , manufacture and export of firearms , the most elaborate in the world , ” Bromund told ███ . “ How would we use a treaty that gives enormous discretion to the Administration on the import and export of arms ? Essentially , it would give the Administration much more control than it already has . ”
Moreover , the treaty is unlikely to change any behavior on the part of lawbreaking regimes and dictatorships around the world whose handing on of weapons to terrorists or criminal enterprises is supposedly one of the activities the treaty will curb .
On the surface , the treaty , which aims to regulate the sale and resale of weapons ranging from tanks to missiles to rifles and pistols , is aimed at creating a more manageable environment for the international arms trade .
The multi-billion-dollar market in illicit weapons sales , according to a report by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , leads to “ armed violence , conflict and civil unrest involving violations of international law , abuses of the rights of children , civilian casualties , humanitarian crises and missed social and economic opportunities . ”
Critics of the treaty effort , however , see something equally bad : a nebulous international agreement that does nothing to improve U.S. security but opens the way to “ damage by a thousand cuts , ” as one critic put it , to the U.S. civilian right to bear arms and also to American foreign policy interests , no matter what the State Department may currently say about defending both .
For one thing , notes Bromund , most nations negotiating the treaty—which include Russia , China and Iran— “ do not recognize the human right of self-defense ” against tyrannical or murderous regimes—the essential basis of the Second Amendment .
Instead , a draft version of the treaty prepared in advance of the November vote emphasizes the “ the inherent right of all States to individual or collective self-defense , ” and leaves it up to individual nation states themselves to police such issues as whether their arms sales will “ be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law . ”
Whether some of the world ’ s worst human rights violators , who are also arms exporters to even more murderous regimes , would spend much time worrying about such niceties , Bromund indicated , is unlikely .
“ All these other nations are free to improve their export policies without any kind of treaty at all , ” Bromund argues . “ They choose not to . What does that tell you about their intentions ?
“ It is profoundly unlikely to restrain really bad actors , or make the less bad improve . It is basically pernicious . Relying on a treaty to stop irresponsible nations from acting irresponsibly is about as sensible as seeking to solve the problem of crime by outlawing it . If the arms trade treaty could work , it would not be necessary . ”
Moreover , critics point out that the draft version of the treaty contains a number of provisions that would make a bad situation from the U.S. point of view even worse . Among them :
-- various clauses in the treaty mandate domestic gun control as part of an ostensibly international obligation to end illegal “ end use , ” creating the possibility of a broad expansion of national regulatory powers .
-- terms such as the “ transfer ” of arms under the treaty are undefined , again leading the possibility of broad regulatory expansion—and not merely to adhere to the arms treaty . According to one clause , for example , signatories “ shall not authorize any transfer of conventional arms within the scope of this Treaty if the transfer would violate its relevant international obligations , under international agreements to which it is a Party ” —a clearly open-ended commitment .
-- another clause bans the transfer of arms to “ facilitate ” among other things “ crimes against humanity ” —a phrase now often used , in the highly-charged U.N. environment , for allegations against Israel . The same vagueness applies to terms like “ serious violations to international humanitarian law ” —a fuzzy body of assertions that no single nation may endorse .
-- as currently written , the treaty allows its subsequent amendment by a majority of the original parties , meaning that the U.S. could later find it was bound by provisions it had not agreed to .
A more subtle flaw , notes Bromund , is that any badly designed treaty that the U.S. agrees to at the negotiations , and that the President signs , can have an effect on U.S. laws and regulations even though it would still need to be ratified by the Senate , which must approve international agreements by a two-thirds majority .
The reason : once a treaty is signed , the parties must respect its “ object and purpose ” even before ratification—or if ratification does not occur—which is “ completely in the eye of the beholder , ” Bromund says .
Case in point : the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions , which was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the U.S. Senate . Nonetheless , the U.S. participates in Kyoto Protocol meetings , observes greenhouse gas limits of its own , and operates as if conforming U.S. legislation may pass in the future .
Thus even agreements that are not ratified by the U.S. can become what Bromund calls “ zombie treaties ” – feeding on internal issues that radically define and distort U.S. political and regulatory behavior for decades .
John Bolton , a former U.S . Ambassador to the U.N. and ███ contributor , notes that the already controversial treaty could get worse , from a U.S. point of view , before it reaches its final form in March .
“ My experience is that a lot of the worst provisions in these agreements come in at the last minute , ” Bolton says . He added : “ It ’ s unbelievable that the issue is still kicking around . ”
In 2001 , as U.S. assistant secretary of state for arms control and international security during the first George W. Bush Administration , Bolton voiced similar concerns about aspects of an earlier U.N. effort to install a “ Program of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects . ”
The Program of Action is far foggier than the proposed new treaty . Among other things , it advocates “ mobilizing the political will throughout the international community to prevent and combat illicit transfers and manufacturing of small arms and light weapons in all their aspects , ” and to “ raise awareness of the character and seriousness of the interrelated problems associated with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in these weapons . ”
In other words , it promotes lobbying and advocacy , often by non-governmental organizations with political agendas of their own , on behalf of the arms sales goals .
The Program of Action , which followed a previous attempt to get a formal international arms sale treaty passed in the 1990s , is still in existence , under the aegis of the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs .
It holds periodic conferences and demands that adherents provide reports on their progress toward Program goals .
For example , Iran—which funnels arms to terrorist groups in Lebanon , Iraq and elsewhere , as well as to the Assad regime in Syria—noted this year that it in 2011 it had created a “ special judicial authority ” to investigate and punish violators of a new law “ on the punishment or trafficking in arms and ammunitions and possessors of illicit arms and ammunitions . ”
The penalties under the law , and the nature of the new “ judicial authority , ” were not outlined .
“ Iran is well respected at the U.N. , ” notes Wayne LaPierre , executive director of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) , who calls the radical Islamic republic a member in good standing of the “ club of governments ” who pursue international gun control law for their own ends .
And most of the killing of civilians in the developing world , he adds , “ is done by governments in that club . ”

John Bolton, a former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and Fox News contributor, notes that the already controversial treaty could get worse, from a U.S. point of view, before it reaches its final form in March.

“My experience is that a lot of the worst provisions in these agreements come in at the last minute,” Bolton says. He added: “It’s unbelievable that the issue is still kicking around.”

In 2001, as U.S. assistant secretary of state for arms control and international security during the first George W. Bush Administration, Bolton voiced similar concerns about aspects of an earlier U.N. effort to install a “Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.”

The Program of Action is far foggier than the proposed new treaty. Among other things, it advocates “mobilizing the political will throughout the international community to prevent and combat illicit transfers and manufacturing of small arms and light weapons in all their aspects,” and to “raise awareness of the character and seriousness of the interrelated problems associated with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in these weapons.”

In other words, it promotes lobbying and advocacy, often by non-governmental organizations with political agendas of their own, on behalf of the arms sales goals.

The Program of Action, which followed a previous attempt to get a formal international arms sale treaty passed in the 1990s, is still in existence, under the aegis of the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs.

It holds periodic conferences and demands that adherents provide reports on their progress toward Program goals.

For example, Iran—which funnels arms to terrorist groups in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere, as well as to the Assad regime in Syria—noted this year that it in 2011 it had created a “special judicial authority” to investigate and punish violators of a new law “on the punishment or trafficking in arms and ammunitions and possessors of illicit arms and ammunitions.”

The penalties under the law, and the nature of the new “judicial authority,” were not outlined.

“Iran is well respected at the U.N.,” notes Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the National Rifle Association (NRA), who calls the radical Islamic republic a member in good standing of the “club of governments” who pursue international gun control law for their own ends.

And most of the killing of civilians in the developing world, he adds, “is done by governments in that club.”

Walmart is to stop sales of some types of ammunition following recent shootings, including one at one of its stores in Texas that left 22 dead.

The head of the company said it would discontinue sales of some bullets that can be used in assault-style weapons, and those used in handguns.

The move comes amid increasing pressure on the company, often cited as the largest firearms seller in the US.

Chief executive Doug McMillon said the company had been ""listening"".

""It's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,"" he said in a note to employees and published on the firm's website.

The firm also said it would discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only place it still offered such weapons.

The firm asked customers at Walmart and its Sam's Club stores to stop carrying firearms openly, even in states where it is legally permitted, saying such actions have caused fear and evacuations.

Jessica Adelman, group vice-president of corporate affairs, said in a statement that only authorised law enforcement officers should be carrying weapons in Kroger outlets.

Business impact?

Walmart's chief executive, who also called on the US Congress to pass stricter gun laws, said he expected the changes to reduce the firm's share of the ammunition market from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%.

The company will continue to sell hunting rifles and shotguns, and much of the ammunition for those weapons, he added.

Mass shootings in the US

Walmart's decision follows two incidents at stores in August, in which a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, and a former employee killed two workers at a Walmart store in Mississippi.

Last month, other mass shootings - defined since 2012 as incidents as those that kill at least three people - in Ohio and Texas left more than a dozen dead.

There have been more than 110 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones.

gun_control_and_gun_rights,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-united-states-america,"America's gun problem, explained",2015-10-03,"German Lopez, Terry Nguyen, Nicole Narea, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Eric Johnson, Andrew Prokop","This weekend , it happened again : more mass shootings in America . This time , gunmen in an attack in Odessa and Midland , Texas , and another in Mobile , Alabama , shot dozens of people , with at least several reported dead .
Already , the shootings have led to demands for action . “ How many of @ JohnCornyn @ tedcruz constituents must die before they do something ? ” the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted , referring to Texas Sens . John Cornyn and Ted Cruz , both Republicans who have resisted stricter gun laws .
But if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings , from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017 , the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low .
This has become an American routine : After every mass shooting , the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again . Maybe some bills get introduced . Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns . The debate stalls . So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world , nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress , nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror .
So why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting , nothing seems to change ? To understand that , it ’ s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States , but America ’ s unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure , seemingly against all odds , that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life .
No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America . The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada , more than seven times as Sweden , and nearly 16 times as Germany , according to UN data compiled by the Guardian . ( These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate , which includes non-gun deaths , than other developed nations . )
To understand why that is , there ’ s another important statistic : The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world . Estimated for 2017 , the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents , meaning there were more firearms than people . The world ’ s second-ranked country was Yemen , a quasi-failed state torn by civil war , where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents , according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey .
Another way of looking at that : Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world ’ s population , yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world ’ s privately held firearms .
That does not , however , mean that every American adult actually owns guns . In fact , gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population — as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest .
These three basic facts demonstrate America ’ s unique gun culture . There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence — a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal . And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world . At the same time , these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority , who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures .
The research on this is overwhelmingly clear : No matter how you look at the data , more guns mean more gun deaths .
This is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) within the United States , as this chart from Mother Jones demonstrates :
And it ’ s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) across developed nations , as this chart , based on data from GunPolicy.org , shows :
Opponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America ’ s unusual levels of gun violence — particularly mental illness . But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims , not perpetrators , of violence . And Michael Stone , a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters , wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database , or about 22 percent , were mentally ill. “ The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘ chief ’ perpetrators of mass murder , ” Stone concluded . Other research has backed this up .
Another argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns , enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting .
Yet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths , but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths . While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others , the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents .
Multiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people , if placed in an active shooter situation while armed , will not be able to stop the situation , and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process .
This video , from ABC News , shows one such simulation , in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they ’ re shot :
The relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates , meanwhile , is well established . Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health ’ s Injury Control Research Center backs this up : After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime , places with more guns have more gun deaths — not just homicides but also suicides , domestic violence , violence against police , and mass shootings .
For example , a 2013 study , led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher , found that , after controlling for multiple variables , each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate .
As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley ’ s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found , it ’ s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries . This chart , based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University , shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime :
Instead , the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that ’ s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns .
“ A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar , ” Zimring and Hawkins wrote . “ A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London . ”
Guns are not the only contributor to violence . ( Other factors include , for example , poverty , urbanization , and alcohol consumption . ) But when researchers control for other confounding variables , they have found time and time again that America ’ s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers .
To deal with its problem , America will have to not only make guns less accessible , but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well .
The research also speaks to this point : A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries , published in Epidemiologic Reviews , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives .
But even with the outrage over gun massacres , the sense that enough is enough , and the clear evidence that the problem is America ’ s high gun ownership rates , there hasn ’ t been significant legislation to help solve the problem .
3 ) Americans tend to support measures to restrict guns , but that doesn ’ t translate into laws
If you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures , they will often say that they support them . According to Pew Research Center surveys , most people in the US support universal background checks , a federal database to track gun sales , bans on assault-style weapons , and bans on high-capacity magazines . Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun , another proposal with solid research behind it .
So why don ’ t these measures ever get turned into law ? That ’ s in part because they run into another political issue : Americans , increasingly in recent years , tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns .
This is part of how gun control opponents are able to kill even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures , such as background checks that include private sales ( which have upwards of 80 percent support , according to Pew ) : They ’ re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns , and galvanize a backlash against it .
This kind of problem isn ’ t unique to guns . For example , although many Americans say they don ’ t like the Affordable Care Act ( also known as Obamacare ) , most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law . The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a “ government takeover of health care ” and “ death panels. ” Since most Americans don ’ t have time to verify these claims , especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts , enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward .
Of course , it ’ s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws . And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control , the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they ’ re backed by a very powerful political lobby .
4 ) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful
The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is , undoubtedly , the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) . The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America , and that development is more recent than you might think .
The NRA was , for much of its early history , more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control , and even supported some gun restrictions . In 1934 , NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying , “ I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns . I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses . ”
A 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything . As crime rose in the 1960s and ’ 70s , calls for more gun control grew as well . NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law — eventually ending , they feared , with the government ’ s seizure of all firearms in America . So members mobilized , installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership , forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today .
This foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms . It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations , such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases , are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America , which the NRA views — wrongly , in the minds of some legal experts — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution .
So any time there ’ s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control , the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill these bills . These gun owners make up a minority of the population : anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households , depending on which survey one uses . But that population is a large and active enough constituency , particularly within the Republican base , to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers .
As a result , conservative media and politicians take the NRA ’ s support — especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out — very seriously . Politicians will go to sometimes absurd length to show their support for gun rights . In 2015 , for example , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) starred in a video , from IJ Review , in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun .
Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA , none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has .
This might be changing . Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland , Florida , shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords , gun control groups are generally more organized , better funded , and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US . As a result , Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control .
But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle : very passionate opponents . As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000 , “ The question is intensity versus preference . You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls . But are they going to vote on their ‘ control ’ position ? ” Probably not , Norquist suggested , “ but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns , they will vote on this . ”
What ’ s behind that passion ? Kristin Goss , author of The Gun Debate : What Everyone Needs to Know , suggested that it ’ s a sense of tangible loss — gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights . In comparison , gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although , Goss noted , the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work , which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable . ( See : # NeverAgain . )
There is also an exception at the state level , where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing ( and relaxing ) restrictions on guns . In the past several years , for instance , Vermont , Washington state , and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks . “ There ’ s a lot more going on than Congress , ” Goss said . “ In blue states , gun laws are getting stricter . And in red states , in some cases , the gun laws are getting looser . ”
But state laws aren ’ t enough . Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules , the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state . This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South , where gun laws are fairly loose , to New York , where gun laws are strict , has earned the name “ the Iron Pipeline. ” But it also happens all across the country , from New York to Chicago to California . Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state . And until such a federal law is passed , there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law .
Yet the NRA ’ s influence and its army of supporters push many of America ’ s legislators , particularly at the federal level and red states , away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them .
5 ) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control
In 1996 , a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur , Australia , killing 35 people and wounding 23 more . It was the worst mass shooting in Australia ’ s history .
Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that , among other provisions , banned certain types of firearms , such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns . The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program , in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners . It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases . ( This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US , which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country . )
The result : Australia ’ s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed , and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent , according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers .
It ’ s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes . Australia ’ s gun deaths , for one , were already declining before the law passed . But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role : “ First , the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback . Second , firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates . ”
One study of the program , by Australian researchers , found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides , and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides . As Dylan Matthews noted for ███ , the drop in homicides wasn ’ t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already . But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking :
One other fact , noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011 : “ While 13 gun massacres ( the killing of 4 or more people at one time ) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [ Australia gun control law ] , resulting in more than one hundred deaths , in the 14 following years ( and up to the present ) , there were no gun massacres . ”
6 ) Although they get a lot of focus , mass shootings are a small portion of all gun violence
Depending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses , there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year . These events are , it goes without saying , devastating tragedies for the nation and , primarily , the victims and their families .
Yet other , less-covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings . Under a broad definition of mass shooting , these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016 . That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year — most of which were suicides , not homicides .
Preventing suicides isn ’ t something we typically include in discussions of gun control , but other countries ’ experiences show it can save lives . In Israel , where military service is mandatory for much of the population , policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend . So Israeli officials , as part of their solution , decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home . It worked : A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent .
So while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control , the problem goes far beyond those incidents . Though it ’ s hard to fault them for trying ; mass shootings , after all , force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture .
But it seems that we as a nation just aren ’ t willing to look , or else don ’ t sufficiently mind what we see , when these events occur . Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School , in Newtown , Connecticut — in which a gunman killed 20 young children , six school personnel , and himself — catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states . Since then , there have been , by some estimates , thousands of mass shootings . And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come .

This time, gunmen in an attack in Odessa and Midland, Texas, and another in Mobile, Alabama, shot dozens of people, with at least several reported dead.

Already, the shootings have led to demands for action. “How many of @JohnCornyn @tedcruz constituents must die before they do something?” the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted, referring to Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both Republicans who have resisted stricter gun laws.

But if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017, the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low.

This has become an American routine: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress, nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror.

So why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it’s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States, but America’s unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life.

1) America’s gun problem is completely unique

No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)

To understand why that is, there’s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey.

Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms.

That does not, however, mean that every American adult actually owns guns. In fact, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population — as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest.

These three basic facts demonstrate America’s unique gun culture. There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence — a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal. And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world. At the same time, these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority, who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures.

2) More guns mean more gun deaths. Period.

The research on this is overwhelmingly clear: No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths.

This is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) within the United States, as this chart from Mother Jones demonstrates:

And it’s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) across developed nations, as this chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows:

Opponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America’s unusual levels of gun violence — particularly mental illness. But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, were mentally ill. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” Stone concluded. Other research has backed this up.

Another argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns, enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting.

Yet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths, but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths. While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others, the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents.

Multiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process.

This video, from ABC News, shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they’re shot:

The relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates, meanwhile, is well established. Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center backs this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths — not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings.

For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.

As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:

Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.

“A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”

Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.

To deal with its problem, America will have to not only make guns less accessible, but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well.

The research also speaks to this point: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.

But even with the outrage over gun massacres, the sense that enough is enough, and the clear evidence that the problem is America’s high gun ownership rates, there hasn’t been significant legislation to help solve the problem.

3) Americans tend to support measures to restrict guns, but that doesn’t translate into laws

If you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures, they will often say that they support them. According to Pew Research Center surveys, most people in the US support universal background checks, a federal database to track gun sales, bans on assault-style weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines. Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun, another proposal with solid research behind it.

So why don’t these measures ever get turned into law? That’s in part because they run into another political issue: Americans, increasingly in recent years, tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns.

This is part of how gun control opponents are able to kill even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures, such as background checks that include private sales (which have upwards of 80 percent support, according to Pew): They’re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns, and galvanize a backlash against it.

This kind of problem isn’t unique to guns. For example, although many Americans say they don’t like the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law. The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a “government takeover of health care” and “death panels.” Since most Americans don’t have time to verify these claims, especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts, enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward.

Of course, it’s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws. And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they’re backed by a very powerful political lobby.

4) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful

The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America, and that development is more recent than you might think.

The NRA was, for much of its early history, more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control, and even supported some gun restrictions. In 1934, NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”

A 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything. As crime rose in the 1960s and ’70s, calls for more gun control grew as well. NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law — eventually ending, they feared, with the government’s seizure of all firearms in America. So members mobilized, installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership, forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today.

This foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms. It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations, such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases, are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America, which the NRA views — wrongly, in the minds of some legal experts — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.

So any time there’s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill these bills.

As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA’s support — especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out — very seriously. Politicians will go to sometimes absurd length to show their support for gun rights. In 2015, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun.

Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has.

This might be changing. Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland, Florida, shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords, gun control groups are generally more organized, better funded, and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control.

But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: very passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, “The question is intensity versus preference.

There is also an exception at the state level, where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past several years, for instance, Vermont, Washington state, and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks. “There’s a lot more going on than Congress,” Goss said. “In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.”

But state laws aren’t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name “the Iron Pipeline.” But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state.

5) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control

In 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history.

Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.)

6) Although they get a lot of focus, mass shootings are a small portion of all gun violence

Depending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses, there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year. These events are, it goes without saying, devastating tragedies for the nation and, primarily, the victims and their families.

Yet other, less-covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings.

So while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control, the problem goes far beyond those incidents. Though it’s hard to fault them for trying; mass shootings, after all, force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture.

But it seems that we as a nation just aren’t willing to look, or else don’t sufficiently mind what we see, when these events occur. Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut — in which a gunman killed 20 young children, six school personnel, and himself — catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states. Since then, there have been, by some estimates, thousands of mass shootings. And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come.

''
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have tried banning certain guns before . Nearly two decades ago , they barred the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons , only to let that law lapse 10 years later . But one gun ban has stayed on the books : a measure Congress passed a quarter-century ago making it illegal for civilians to buy or sell any machine gun made from that date forward . That legislation passed with the blessing of the National Rifle Association , which now opposes gun control measures .
In April 1986 , after months of efforts , the NRA had finally rallied enough support in the Democratic-controlled House to force a bill onto the floor . The so-called Firearms Owners ' Protection Act would undo many of the provisions in the 1968 Gun Control Act , passed shortly after Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were shot dead .
But just as the bill was about to come to a final vote in that tumultuous House session , New Jersey Democrat William Hughes introduced an amendment . It would forbid the sale to civilians of all machine guns made after the law took effect .
There were enough Democrats to pass the amendment , so nobody objected when the presiding officer , New York Democrat Charles Rangel , called for a voice vote rather than a roll call vote on the machine gun ban .
Former NRA lobbyist Richard Feldman , who has since parted ways with the organization , tells NPR that Wayne LaPierre , currently NRA 's executive vice president , was willing to let the machine gun ban go forward if it meant the larger bill it was attached to would pass .

When President Obama laid out his proposals Wednesday to reduce gun violence, he included a call for Congress to ban ""military-style assault weapons.""

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have tried banning certain guns before. Nearly two decades ago, they barred the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons, only to let that law lapse 10 years later. But one gun ban has stayed on the books: a measure Congress passed a quarter-century ago making it illegal for civilians to buy or sell any machine gun made from that date forward. That legislation passed with the blessing of the National Rifle Association, which now opposes gun control measures.

An Amendment

In April 1986, after months of efforts, the NRA had finally rallied enough support in the Democratic-controlled House to force a bill onto the floor. The so-called Firearms Owners' Protection Act would undo many of the provisions in the 1968 Gun Control Act, passed shortly after Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were shot dead.

But just as the bill was about to come to a final vote in that tumultuous House session, New Jersey Democrat William Hughes introduced an amendment. It would forbid the sale to civilians of all machine guns made after the law took effect.

There were enough Democrats to pass the amendment, so nobody objected when the presiding officer, New York Democrat Charles Rangel, called for a voice vote rather than a roll call vote on the machine gun ban.

Former NRA lobbyist Richard Feldman, who has since parted ways with the organization, tells NPR that Wayne LaPierre, currently NRA's executive vice president, was willing to let the machine gun ban go forward if it meant the larger bill it was attached to would pass.

""I remember very well having dinner ... with Wayne LaPierre on the big victory after it passed the House,"" he says. ""And we weren't too concerned about the machine gun issue, but it came back to haunt Warren Cassidy.""

Opening The Door?

At the time, Cassidy headed the NRA's lobby, the Institute for Legislative Action. He confirms now that LaPierre, who did not respond to a request for comment, pushed hard to let the machine gun ban stand.

""He said, 'I want to do it. I think we have to do it.' So I said yes, and that was the end of the story. It passed, and as we learned immediately, an element of NRA, a very vociferous element of NRA ... determined that it just couldn't be that way,"" Cassidy says. ""We couldn't give an inch. I don't think they ever forgave me for it.""

Gun laws expert Robert Spitzer of the State University of New York at Cortland says the bill President Reagan signed into law was more significant than it was perceived at the time.

""One can view the Congress' action in 1986 to ban civilian possession of fully automatic weapons as something of a kind of a precedent that would open the door for restricting civilian access to semiautomatic, assault-style weapons,"" Spitzer says.

Spitzer says a major reason the machine gun ban met so little resistance was a 1934 law passed a month after outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were killed in a hail of machine gun bullets. It required machine gun owners to pay a hefty tax, be fingerprinted and be listed on a national registry.

As a result, he says, sales of machine guns plummeted.

""It is a good example of something that is little known, which is a gun control law that was pretty effective in keeping such weapons out of civilian hands,"" he says. ""So by 1986, when the provision was added to the Firearm Owners' Protection Act to bar any newly produced fully automatic weapon from possession by civilians, it was really a fairly small step to make, because so few of them were in circulation to begin with.""

Chris Murphy sprang into action almost immediately after a gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub — accusing Congress of an “ unconscionable deafening silence ” and launching a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor .
But the gun-control advocate who once argued that lawmakers should put forward “ legislative action within an hour of a shooting ” was more circumspect on Wednesday after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in the suburbs of Washington . One tragic incident , he acknowledged , won ’ t move the needle — even one that affected one of their own , House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) .
“ This is very personal . I mean , Steve is a friend of mine and frankly my time this morning has been dedicated just to making sure that my friends are OK , ” Murphy said . “ The way you talk certainly is affected by the fact that your priority is that the people you know are still alive . ”
The Connecticut Democrat continued : “ We ’ re beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings . I mean , we don ’ t . We don ’ t . After Orlando and Sandy Hook , that ’ s clearly not how people ’ s minds work here . ”
The shooting Wednesday morning on a sleepy suburban baseball field — injuring Scalise and four others — horrified Capitol Hill , which has cycled through repeated rounds of tense battles over gun policy after mass shootings in recent years .
But on Wednesday , the tone among even the most ardent proponents of stricter gun laws was dramatically different . In multiple interviews , several Democratic lawmakers urged that no , today was not the day to revive the dormant gun control debate . It was too soon , it hit too close to home — and lawmakers simply didn ’ t want to stand accused of politicizing a shooting that injured a colleague and friend .

I ’ m praying for the victims . I ’ m praying for the police officers . ”
“ Today we need to focus on what happened and our prayers have to be with the injured , ” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) . “ We can talk about other issues in the future . ”
Congressional Democrats have taken notably sharper and more aggressive tactics in recent years when it comes to advocating for tougher gun laws . The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando spurred the most visible action — not only Murphy ’ s filibuster but a sit-in led by House Democrats in the chamber that lasted more than 25 hours and captured national attention .
But Democratic lawmakers tiptoed around the gun issue on Wednesday . Notably , several Democrats asked to speak without attribution for fear of being seen as insensitive so soon after one of their colleagues was shot . They acknowledged privately that if the shooting of another colleague — former Rep. Gabby Giffords ( D-Ariz. ) — and the mass shooting in Newtown didn ’ t move the dial , this won ’ t either .
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois , the No . 2 Senate Democrat and another advocate of stricter gun laws , also spoke about a “ feeling of resignation ” for his party in the gun debate .
“ Until there ’ s significant changes around the country or within Congress , we know each other ’ s positions and we know they don ’ t change , ” Durbin said . “ There ’ s a fatigue . We know each other ’ s arguments . We know what ’ s going to happen . ”
Democrats say they ’ re not abandoning their push for tougher gun laws , but they didn ’ t think it was appropriate to talk about it too quickly after Wednesday ’ s shooting , which occurred around 7 a.m. during the GOP lawmakers ’ practice in advance of the annual congressional baseball game Thursday .

“ I think that both sides of the aisle are going to be pretty disciplined on just focusing on [ the victims ] today , ” Rep. Tony Cardenas ( D-Calif. ) said . “ And then tomorrow we ’ ll probably , hopefully respectfully , get back to the debates of what kind of policies we should have . ”
Even lawmakers who have seen an uptick in death threats against them recently like Rep. Al Green ( D-Texas ) weren ’ t ready to revive the gun debate . Green became the target of lynching threats after calling for President Donald Trump ’ s impeachment .
“ I think these are issues that I would feel more comfortable discussing a little bit more removed from what happened today , ” he told reporters following a briefing for House lawmakers on Wednesday ’ s shooting . “ I don ’ t want someone to think that I ’ m seizing on this as an opportunity to get into a debate that may seem political in nature . ”
There were other differences between shootings that prompted gun control pushes from Democrats and what happened Wednesday , such as that the massacres in Newtown , San Bernardino and Orlando were tragedies of a significantly larger scale , with upwards of dozens of fatalities .
In Wednesday ’ s shooting , only the suspect — identified by law enforcement officials as James Hodgkinson , 66 , of Belleville , Illinois — has died . Hodgkinson had often published social media posts lashing out at Trump and the GOP , stoking concern from Republican lawmakers about whether they will be targeted because of their party label .
Last June , Democrats in the Senate prompted the most sweeping debate over gun policy since the aftermath of Sandy Hook , when the chamber considered restricting firearms access to those with ties to terrorism and to bolster background checks . But the deeply divided chamber rejected all four measures put on the Senate floor for a vote .
Three years before that , Sens . Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) and Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) teamed up on a comprehensive background checks proposal in the wake of Sandy Hook . It was ultimately filibustered by nearly all Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate .
On Wednesday , Manchin downplayed speculation about whether the shooting would prompt any concrete legislative action tightening rules on gun ownership .
`` It always spurs that , '' Manchin said of a new gun control push . `` I just do n't get overexcited anymore . ''
Another Republican who backed Manchin-Toomey — Sen. John McCain of Arizona — said Wednesday that reviving a gun debate would “ be fine with me , whenever they want to. ” But most other GOP lawmakers have long resisted enacting new and tougher firearms restrictions .
“ I own a gun ; I don ’ t go around shooting people with it . Bottom line : People get shot , run over by cars , stabbed . It ’ s just a crazy world , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) . “ If we had that debate it ’ d end like it always ends . We ’ re not going to tell law-abiding people they can ’ t own a gun because of some nut job . ”
Indeed , as legislative battles over gun policy raged in the Senate , the GOP-controlled House did not take up firearms measures on the floor , even in the aftermath of Orlando . A House panel on Wednesday had been scheduled to take up legislation making it easier to purchase gun silencers — the most significant movement on gun rights measures under the new Trump administration — but that hearing was postponed .
The legislative standstill in Washington has forced supporters of additional gun restrictions to confront a difficult reality on Capitol Hill — is it even possible in this political climate to enact tougher laws while balancing constitutional rights to own firearms ?

Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying `` homicidal maniacs '' will skirt the system no matter what .
NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation . He argued that more security and more enforcement , but not new laws , is the answer to gun violence .
He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for `` universal '' background checks , particularly at gun shows .
`` When it comes to background checks , let 's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them , '' LaPierre said .
But Giffords ' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority . He said holes in the law `` make a mockery '' of the system -- echoing Obama 's recent proposal , he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well . He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head .
LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject `` law-abiding people '' to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after `` bad guys . ''
`` Mr. LaPierre that 's the point , '' Durbin said . `` The criminals wo n't get to purchase the guns because there 'll be a background check . We 'll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely . I think it 's basic . ''
Raising his voice , LaPierre said : `` Senator , I think you missed the point ! '' Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , then banged the gavel and called for order .
The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month .
LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones . `` Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works , '' LaPierre testified . `` Unfortunately , we 've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years . ''
He continued : `` Proposing more gun control laws , while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it 's not a serious solution for reducing crime . ''
The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate . Giffords , who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011 , made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act .

But he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . `` Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns , '' Grassley said .","Influential figures on both sides of the gun control debate tangled Wednesday over the effectiveness of background checks, with the husband of wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying ""homicidal maniacs"" will skirt the system no matter what.

NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement, but not new laws, is the answer to gun violence.

He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for ""universal"" background checks, particularly at gun shows.

""When it comes to background checks, let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,"" LaPierre said.

But Giffords' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law ""make a mockery"" of the system -- echoing Obama's recent proposal, he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.

LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject ""law-abiding people"" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after ""bad guys.""

""Mr. LaPierre that's the point,"" Durbin said. ""The criminals won't get to purchase the guns because there'll be a background check. We'll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it's basic.""

Raising his voice, LaPierre said: ""Senator, I think you missed the point!"" Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then banged the gavel and called for order.

The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.

LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. ""Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works,"" LaPierre testified. ""Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years.""

He continued: ""Proposing more gun control laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it's not a serious solution for reducing crime.""

The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords, who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011, made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.

""We must do something,"" Giffords said, speaking slowly but clearly. ""It will be hard, but the time is now. ... You must act.""

Giffords urged lawmakers to ""be bold, be courageous."" She later met with President Obama at the White House.

""Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying,"" the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed, and 12 were wounded, in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.

Kelly, speaking after his wife, called for a ""careful and civil conversation"" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns, but are ""anti-gun violence.""

He said a ""matrix"" of failures contributes to the country's gun violence problem, including mental illness and poverty, but also gun laws. He said the complexity is ""not an excuse for inaction."" Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America ""into places of carnage and gross human loss.""

Kelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family, leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.

LaPierre, though, argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent, compared to previous administrations, which he says means violent felons, gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.

There is a stark racial disparity in gun violence

Much of America’s day-to-day gun violence is concentrated in America’s poorest, most racially segregated neighborhoods – places with high rates of unemployment, struggling school systems, and high levels of mistrust between police officers and community members.

African Americans, who represent 13% of the total population, make up more than half of overall gun murder victims. Roughly 15 of the 30 Americans murdered with guns each day are black men.

Gun violence in America, as criminologist Frank Zimring put it, is another regressive tax on the poor. Some black neighborhoods have experienced so much violence that their residents report symptoms of post-traumatic stress at rates comparable to veterans of war.

Too much emphasis on mass shootings has a cost

America’s gun control debate continues to revolve around the exact circumstances of the shooting that is currently on the news. Is a new gun law worth it, or not? That depends on whether it might have prevented this particular shooting. While this is an understandable, human response, it is a terrible way to go about saving lives.

The shock and horror that follows mass shootings has led to an obsessive focus on the dangers of military-style rifles – even though rifles of any kind were used in less than 3% of gun murders in 2014, according to FBI data.

A tunnel focus on mass shootings has also fueled the public perception that mental illness is driving gun violence. But experts caution that even miraculously curing all schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression in American might only lead to a 4% reduction in overall violence.

Gun control advocates said they hope the White House and the president won’t hesitate for long before diving back into the legislative battle.

“I think it’s appropriate for the White House to wait until we know what happened, but at some point soon we will time to think hard about whether some senators who voted against what 90 percent of the public wants — expanded background checks — have some explaining to do,” Glaze said.

“While this issue is so prominent and in front of the American public, it is an appropriate time to make another push,” Gross said.

Gross noted that in the 1990s, the Brady Bill “took six votes, over seven years and three Congresses to pass.”

Despite the recent spate of mass shootings, the public does not seem as exercised about the issue as it was in the 1990s when those incidents took place against a backdrop of widespread concern about violent crime. Murder rates have dropped by more than half in many parts of the country.

“From the 70s through the early 90s, the crime rate was going up steadily and the feeling was this is inexorable and is only going to get worse,” said Jim Kessler of the Democratic centrist group Third Way. “It was the top of mind issue. Mike Dukakis arguably lost the presidential election on the basis of how he handled one, single criminal case. That’d be unimaginable today.”",www.politico.com,left,WRu58UgO8wtClZfX

Of those interviewed for the survey , the percent of people saying they have a gun inside their home was up by almost 4 percentage points and the same increase goes for those who think owning a gun will protect them from crime .
Forty-four percent , or 881 of the 2,010 respondents , told Pew they have a gun inside their home , and 58 percent said they see it as a means of protection .
Also , the majority of those who equate firearms with protection were white , Republican men with some college education and owned a gun . Last year had similar results , however , the number of minorities who view guns for protection also jumped . Black support increased by 9 percentage points and Hispanic support had increased by 4 percentage points .
Pew ’ s results for gun ownership are within range of results by similar surveying companies asking the question . A survey published in July by Quinnipiac University , which also showed Americans having strong yet conflicting feelings about guns , revealed 45 percent of respondents saying they had a gun in their home ; a CBS News poll published in June had 36 percent ; and a CNN poll from January showed 40 percent .
Yet , many point to the General Social Survey because of its massive dataset and detailed questionnaire for an accurate reflection of American views . Its most recent study showed gun ownership dropping from 47.6 percent in 1974 to 32.4 percent in 2014 .
Pew ’ s results from last week also showed most respondents supporting gun control policies and even more interestingly where Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters agree .
Expanded background checks drew support from 75 percent of Trump supporters and 90 percent of Clinton supporters ; preventing people with mental illness from buying guns gained 82 and 83 percent ; and barring those on federal terror watchlists gained 72 and 80 percent .
Overall , 83 percent said they support expanding background checks to include private sales and gun shows ; 81 percent support for preventing those with mental illness from buying a gun ; 74 percent support to prohibit anyone on a terror watchlist from buying a firearm ; and 54 percent support for an assault weapons ban .","A recent survey by Pew Research shows a higher percentage of gun owners and support for firearms as a means for protection, but also the majority supporting gun control policies like expanded background checks and ban on assault weapons.

A group of gun-rights activists seeking to oust a top Democratic state lawmaker in Colorado over the passage of strict gun control legislation on Monday turned in double the signatures needed to force a recall election.

KDVR reports the group turned in over 16,000 signatures, more than double the 7,178 valid signatures needed, to the Colorado Secretary of State's office in the effort to recall Colorado Senate President John Morse.

“This sends a strong message,” Rob Harris, who delivered three boxes full of petitions to the office, told KDVR. “We’ve obtained enough signatures to recall a state legislator for the first time in the history of Colorado.”

The Secretary of State’s office now has 15 days to determine whether enough of the signatures are valid, and then Morse's office has another 15 days to contest the validity of the signatures.

Morse tells KDVR he is going to fight the recall effort.

“We’ll go through these signatures with a fine-toothed comb,” Morse told the station. “And we’ll file some protests with the Secretary of State’s office because we know a lot of these signatures were gathered based on misinformation and lies.”

He also insisted he will not resign his seat to avoid a recall election.

“This is a hill worth dying on,” Morse said. “This is a fight worth having; it’s a fight we’ve already had on the floor of the Senate; it’s a fight worth winning.”

Last week, the non-profit America Votes, which lists New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg among its backers, released a video in support of Morse.

“I ran this recall,” he told KDVR. “Not the N.R.A. It sends a message to Denver and Washington, DC that we, the people, are watching and that we will do something about it.”

The effort against Morse has become a national focus of efforts to push back against lawmakers from moderate districts who support ratcheting back gun rights.

Gun-rights activists are seeking to recall another Democrat, a senator from Pueblo. Signatures in that effort aren't due until next week.
