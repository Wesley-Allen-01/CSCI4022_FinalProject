German minister says Russia , China blocked U.N. Security Council resolution
Syria is urged to give a U.N. chemical weapons inspection team access to the site
Al-Assad government says claims it used chemical weapons are `` completely baseless ''
The United Nations and the United States are calling for an immediate investigation of Syrian activists ' claims that the Bashar al-Assad government used chemical weapons in an attack on civilians .
Anti-regime activist groups in Syria say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack outside Damascus , many of them women and children . Video footage and witness reports appeared to bolster claims that chemical weapons were used .
President Barack Obama has directed the U.S. intelligence community to urgently gather additional information to try to assess whether chemical weapons were used Wednesday , State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday .
At this time , she said , the United States is unable to `` conclusively determine '' chemical weapons use , but is focused on trying to nail down the facts , along with its international partners .
Psaki said , as she has before , that if reports of chemical weapons use prove true , the president has a range of options available to him to respond .

Later , a senior defense official told CNN that `` the military continues to refine options for Syria to be prepared for whatever the president might request down the line . ''
Psaki noted that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone Thursday to Syrian opposition leader Ahmad Jarba ; U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon ; and French , Jordanian , Turkish and European Union leaders .
Ban Ki-moon said the alleged incidents Wednesday need to be probed `` without delay . ''
Ban urged a Damascus-based team `` to be granted permission and access to swiftly investigate the incident '' and the United Nations is sending a formal request to Syria .
`` He expects to receive a positive response without delay , '' his spokesperson said in a statement .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the matter is `` of utmost urgency '' and the `` allegations are exceptionally grave . ''
Pillay urged both the government and opposition to enable investigators `` to examine the site of the alleged attacks without any delay or obfuscation . ''
`` The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under customary international law , '' she said , noting that the prohibition is binding on the government and rebels .
`` Whether or not chemical weapons were in fact used , it seems that once again in Syria many civilians have been killed in flagrant contravention of international law . ''
U.N. special advisers Adama Dieng and Jennifer Welsh similarly urged immediate access for the U.N. investigation .

`` There is never any military justification for the use of chemical weapons -- whether by governments or anti-government armed groups -- given their horrific and indiscriminate impact , '' they said in a joint statement .
The reports prompted international outrage , with a U.N. Security Council briefing called late Wednesday to discuss the situation . However , Russia and China -- consistent allies of the Syrian government -- reportedly blocked a formal resolution .
Hours after the closed-door meeting , French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told CNN affiliate BFMTV that `` a reaction of force must be taken '' if the allegations are true .
`` If the U.N. Security Council can not do it , decisions will be made otherwise , '' Fabius said . But , he said , sending ground troops to Syria is out of question .
Fabius also added his voice to calls for a U.N. team currently in Syria to investigate previous claims of chemical weapons use by either side to be given access to the site of the alleged massacre outside Damascus .
If al-Assad 's regime `` has nothing to reproach itself with , '' it should let the U.N. weapons inspectors investigate the alleged attack , Fabius said . `` If the Syrians refuse , that means they have been caught red-handed , '' he said .
Speaking on a visit to Berlin , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called on the United Nations to act decisively , Turkey 's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported .
Davutoglu said `` all red lines '' have been crossed without the United Nations taking action in Syria and that the body `` ca n't assume an undecisive attitude about chemical weapon attacks '' there .
`` If the Syrian regime is confident enough , it should allow the U.N. team to investigate ( the chemical attack claims ) immediately , '' he added .
Speaking alongside him , German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the reports from Syria `` are serious and , should they be confirmed , outrageous . ''
He demanded a prompt explanation of the reported chemical weapons use , and also called for the U.N. chemical weapons team to be allowed access .
`` I regret that Russia and China have blocked a formal resolution of the Security Council , '' Westerwelle said .
Al-Assad 's government denied the claims on state-run media Wednesday , calling them `` completely baseless . ''
`` Everything that has been said is absurd , primitive , illogical and fabricated , '' said Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi on state TV . He said the claim was timed by the opposition to coincide with the U.N team 's visit and came as government forces were making gains on all sides against the rebels .
CNN could not immediately verify where or when the videos were recorded , and could not authenticate the number killed or injured .
Yuval Steinitz , Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs , told Israel Radio on Thursday morning that its intelligence assessments indicated that `` chemical weapons were used , and they were not used for the first time . ''
He accused the international community of `` paying lip service '' when it comes to Syria .

German minister says Russia, China blocked U.N. Security Council resolution

Syria is urged to give a U.N. chemical weapons inspection team access to the site

Al-Assad government says claims it used chemical weapons are ""completely baseless""

The United Nations and the United States are calling for an immediate investigation of Syrian activists' claims that the Bashar al-Assad government used chemical weapons in an attack on civilians.

Anti-regime activist groups in Syria say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack outside Damascus, many of them women and children. Video footage and witness reports appeared to bolster claims that chemical weapons were used.

President Barack Obama has directed the U.S. intelligence community to urgently gather additional information to try to assess whether chemical weapons were used Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday.

At this time, she said, the United States is unable to ""conclusively determine"" chemical weapons use, but is focused on trying to nail down the facts, along with its international partners.

Psaki said, as she has before, that if reports of chemical weapons use prove true, the president has a range of options available to him to respond.

Later, a senior defense official told CNN that ""the military continues to refine options for Syria to be prepared for whatever the president might request down the line.""

Psaki noted that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone Thursday to Syrian opposition leader Ahmad Jarba; U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon; and French, Jordanian, Turkish and European Union leaders.

Ban Ki-moon said the alleged incidents Wednesday need to be probed ""without delay.""

Ban urged a Damascus-based team ""to be granted permission and access to swiftly investigate the incident"" and the United Nations is sending a formal request to Syria.

""He expects to receive a positive response without delay,"" his spokesperson said in a statement.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the matter is ""of utmost urgency"" and the ""allegations are exceptionally grave.""

Pillay urged both the government and opposition to enable investigators ""to examine the site of the alleged attacks without any delay or obfuscation.""

""The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under customary international law,"" she said, noting that the prohibition is binding on the government and rebels.

""Whether or not chemical weapons were in fact used, it seems that once again in Syria many civilians have been killed in flagrant contravention of international law.""

U.N. special advisers Adama Dieng and Jennifer Welsh similarly urged immediate access for the U.N. investigation.

""There is never any military justification for the use of chemical weapons -- whether by governments or anti-government armed groups -- given their horrific and indiscriminate impact,"" they said in a joint statement.

International outrage

The reports prompted international outrage, with a U.N. Security Council briefing called late Wednesday to discuss the situation. However, Russia and China -- consistent allies of the Syrian government -- reportedly blocked a formal resolution.

Hours after the closed-door meeting, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told CNN affiliate BFMTV that ""a reaction of force must be taken"" if the allegations are true.

""If the U.N. Security Council cannot do it, decisions will be made otherwise,"" Fabius said. But, he said, sending ground troops to Syria is out of question.

Fabius also added his voice to calls for a U.N. team currently in Syria to investigate previous claims of chemical weapons use by either side to be given access to the site of the alleged massacre outside Damascus.

If al-Assad's regime ""has nothing to reproach itself with,"" it should let the U.N. weapons inspectors investigate the alleged attack, Fabius said. ""If the Syrians refuse, that means they have been caught red-handed,"" he said.

Turkey urges decisive action

Speaking on a visit to Berlin, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called on the United Nations to act decisively, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.

Davutoglu said ""all red lines"" have been crossed without the United Nations taking action in Syria and that the body ""can't assume an undecisive attitude about chemical weapon attacks"" there.

""If the Syrian regime is confident enough, it should allow the U.N. team to investigate (the chemical attack claims) immediately,"" he added.

Speaking alongside him, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the reports from Syria ""are serious and, should they be confirmed, outrageous.""

He demanded a prompt explanation of the reported chemical weapons use, and also called for the U.N. chemical weapons team to be allowed access.

""I regret that Russia and China have blocked a formal resolution of the Security Council,"" Westerwelle said.

Al-Assad's government denied the claims on state-run media Wednesday, calling them ""completely baseless.""

""Everything that has been said is absurd, primitive, illogical and fabricated,"" said Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi on state TV. He said the claim was timed by the opposition to coincide with the U.N team's visit and came as government forces were making gains on all sides against the rebels.

CNN could not immediately verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not authenticate the number killed or injured.

Israel: World paying lip service

Yuval Steinitz, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, told Israel Radio on Thursday morning that its intelligence assessments indicated that ""chemical weapons were used, and they were not used for the first time.""

He accused the international community of ""paying lip service"" when it comes to Syria.

""Nothing practical, significant, has been done in the last two years in order to stop the continuing massacre of civilians carried out by the Assad regime,"" he said. ""I think that the investigation of the United Nations is a joke.""

The White House said Wednesday that officials were ""working urgently to gather additional information."" It called for the U.N. team in Syria to be given immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals, and to be allowed to collect evidence unhindered by the government.

""If the Syrian government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in Syria, it will facilitate the U.N. team's immediate and unfettered access to this site,"" the statement said.

But U.S. senator and former presidential candidate John McCain was strongly critical of the administration's handling of the situation in an interview with CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday.

Witness: Convulsions, trouble breathing

The Syrian civil war has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions, according to the United Nations.

There have been repeated allegations that chemical weapons were being used during the course of the conflict.

The latest alleged attack took place in eastern and western Ghouta, rebel strongholds that the regime has been fighting to take back for more than a year.

Initially, Syrian opposition groups claimed that hundreds were killed Wednesday, but as the day wore on, the number went up -- more than 1,300 people, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees and the Syrian National Council.

Tuesday ’ s horrific videotaped beheading of American photojournalist James Foley was packaged with a new Islamic State posting on social media threatening the United States : “ We will drown all of you in blood . ”
A visibly angered President Obama gave a stern reply Wednesday afternoon , saying in a televised address that the U.S. and its allies will work together to “ extract this cancer ” that is the Islamic State .
“ ISIL speaks for no religion . Their victims are overwhelmingly Muslim , and no faith teaches people to massacre innocents , ” Mr. Obama said . “ No just God would stand for what they did yesterday , and for what they do every single day . ISIL has no ideology of any value to human beings . ”
Just hours after Mr. Obama spoke , the White House revealed that the president had authorized a secret military mission this summer to a site in Syria in a bid to free Mr. Foley and other Americans held by the terrorist group , but the hostages were not there .
“ The U.S. government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence , and when the opportunity presented itself , the president authorized the Department of Defense to move aggressively to recover our citizens , ” said Lisa Monaco , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism . “ Unfortunately , that mission was not successful because the hostages were not present . ”
The White House did not reveal exactly when or where in Syria the mission took place . Citing administration sources , The Associated Press reported that a “ number of militants ” were killed in the operation and one American sustained a minor injury .
• Sign the petition to declare you oppose a government takeover of the Internet
The president also offered his condolences via telephone to Mr. Foley ’ s parents , who also praised their son for his life ’ s work .
Speaking to reporters in front of their New Hampshire home , John and Diane Foley noted his dedication in documenting Syria ’ s conflict and the plight of ordinary Syrians . “ We believe he was a martyr for freedom , ” John Foley said .
In the video , the terrorist group said it was beheading James Foley in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes against its positions in northern Iraq .
The White House said earlier this month that the Islamic State is not a threat to Americans — a position deemed “ utter hogwash ” by Robert Spencer , director of Jihad Watch , which monitors Islamic extremism .
“ The White House says that the U.S. is not at war with the Islamic State , ” Mr. Spencer said . “ But the Islamic State certainly is at war with the U.S . ”
A U.S. intelligence official said Thursday , “ I would tell you ISIL has had a longstanding , overt interest in killing Americans . ”
Mr. Spencer said there is ample evidence that the terrorist group — which controls large portions of Iraq and Syria and has committed mass executions — is gearing up for attacks against the U.S .
The U.S. government believes some Americans have joined the Islamic State and , programmed to conduct suicide bombings , will pose risks upon their return .
Britain says hundreds of its nationals have joined the militants and have committed some of its most brutal killings . British authorities said Wednesday that they suspect the black-clad executioner in Tuesday ’ s beheading video is a Briton .
Prime Minister David Cameron said the man had not been identified , but “ from what we have seen it looks increasingly likely that is a British citizen . ”
Germany and France say about 1,300 of their nationals have joined jihadist groups , including the Islamic State , The Associated Press reported .
In the U.S. , the Islamic State flag has appeared sporadically as the terrorist group ’ s propaganda arm tries to recruit young killers .
“ They have said they are going to go after Americans , ” Mr. Spencer said . “ They have said American civilians are all legitimate targets . It seems to be absolutely certain they will be trying to kill as many Americans as possible in the United States as well as elsewhere . ”
Retired Army Gen. John M. Keane , who is pressing the White House to adopt a broad campaign against the Islamic State , agrees that the terrorist organization of more than 10,000 fighters represents wider threat .
“ [ The Islamic State ] is the new face of al Qaeda and is a threat to U.S. vital interests in the Middle East and a threat to the safety and security of the American people , ” Mr. Keane said . “ Despite some limited setbacks in northern Iraq , IS maintains the initiative and freedom of movement throughout Iraq and Syria . What the U.S. needs is not just rhetoric condemning this barbarism but a U.S.-led strategy with our allies to first stop IS and then defeat them . ”
The Islamic State has perfected the car bomb as a weapon . After U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011 , it unleashed waves of suicide and remotely detonated car bombs throughout Baghdad and other cities .
A Canadian member of the Islamic State was quoted as saying he is training others on how to build such deadly weapons — a hint that such vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices may show up in his home country .
Retired Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin , formerly the Pentagon ’ s No . 2 intelligence official , said the Islamic State ’ s game plan is to threaten the U.S. repeatedly to raise its stature among young potential jihadists .
He said the terrorist group also believes it can intimidate Mr. Obama into halting the roughly 75 airstrikes that have helped Iraqi Kurds protect their capital of Irbil and retake the Mosul Dam .
“ The notion is that Barack Obama is weak right now and he will fall back on appeasing his base , which is very much against any continuation of military ops in Iraq , ” Gen. Boykin said . “ I personally believe that this notion is a miscalculation by IS . Obama is under too much pressure now from inside his own party to try to convince anyone that the U.S. should declare victory and go home . ”
The Obama administration has sent mixed messages on the threat posed by the Islamic State , which previously called itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant .
In January , Mr. Obama seemed to brush off any dangers , comparing it in an interview with The New Yorker to a “ JV team ” compared with al Qaeda .
After the Islamic State army in June swept out of Syria into northern Iraq and took the large city of Mosul and then moved south toward Baghdad , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had a new perspective .
“ Make no mistake , and this country should not make any mistake on this , nor anyone in Congress — ISIL may not appear to be an imminent threat to the United States , ” he said . “ It is a threat to the United States . It is a threat , a clear threat to our partners in that area , and it is imminent . ”
But two weeks ago , Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said no , the Islamic State is not a threat to Americans .
“ Right now , their focus is not on attacking the U.S. homeland or attacking our interests here in the United States or abroad , ” Mr. Blinken told CNN ’ s Jake Tapper .
White House officials attempted to portray this summer ’ s failed rescue mission as proof that the U.S. will do whatever it can to rescue Americans held captive abroad .
“ The president could not be prouder of the U.S. forces who carried out this mission , ” Ms. Monaco said . “ Their effort should serve as another signal to those who would do us harm that the United States will not tolerate the abduction of our people and will spare no effort to secure the safety of our citizens and to hold their captors accountable . ”
On Wednesday , a senior Pentagon official said the State Department is seeking a small boost in troop numbers in Iraq , similar to the incremental increases the Obama administration has approved for the U.S. military operation in the northern part of the country .
“ There is a request by the State Department for additional U.S. personnel , and my understanding is that it ’ s for less than 300 [ troops ] , ” the official said .
The Obama administration has placed 849 military personnel in Iraq and tasked them with conducting airstrikes , conducting assessments and providing Iraqi forces with intelligence , Pentagon officials said .
Additionally , the framework for an international coalition to combat the Islamic State began to form Wednesday , when Germany and France said they were willing to help Kurdish fighters battle the militants .
Germany and Italy announced Wednesday that they were prepared to join Britain and France in delivering weapons and other military gear such as helmets and security vests to the Kurdish fighters .

As part of that arrangement, Softbank announced on Saturday that it had pulled in $93 billion in committed capital for a planned technology fund, fueled in large part by Saudi investment.

His longer term plan is to create thousands of jobs in industries, such as tourism and technology. The program also includes the funding of a giant sovereign wealth fund, with the proceeds of the the IPO of state oil company Saudi Aramco, expected sometime next year.

""Vision 2030 is the signature initiative of MBS, but it is facing quiet opposition at home and disbelief in international financial circles. Trump's support in the White House statement for it when MBS was in D.C. were helpful to MBS. He is likely to mention it again this time. Such support also helps MBS in his ambition to be the new face of Saudi Arabia. But succession politics in the royal family are complicated, so the U.S. needs to be cautious,"" said Simon Henderson, Baker fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Institute's Gulf and Energy Policy Program.

Trump also visits Saudi Arabia just ahead of Thursday's OPEC meeting where the kingdom will lead the cartel in a decision on extending its production cuts. Saudi Arabia has suggested production cuts lasting nine month instead of six months as previously expected. There also was talk that OPEC is considering expanding the current 1.8 million barrels a day cut, but it's not clear whether there would be support for that.",www.cnbc.com,center,Pmu2JsFOrnUAgAfL

Iran has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""liar"" after he accused the country of deceiving the world about its nuclear intentions.

Mr Netanyahu produced what he said were copies of Iranian files detailing a project to build nuclear weapons, which was reportedly mothballed 15 years ago.

Iran said it had never sought to build a bomb when it signed an international deal to curb nuclear activity in 2015.

US President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal.

American allies like the UK and France have called for the agreement to be maintained, arguing that Iran has abided by it, steadily reducing its capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium.

Hostility between Israel and Iran, already bitter enemies, has grown as Iran builds up its military in Syria, on Israel's doorstep.

What did Iran say?

Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi described Mr Netanyahu as an ""infamous liar who has had nothing to offer except lies and deceits"".

His accusations, he continued, were ""worn-out, useless and shameful"".

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the documents produced by Israel were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog.

What is the thrust of Israel's case?

Israel says that Iran is not a reliable partner and the 2015 agreement was reached in bad faith.

Speaking after Mr Netanyahu's presentation of the alleged secret Iranian files, Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador to London, said the Iranian government had deliberately concealed its military nuclear programme.

""It appears we've caught them red-handed lying about what is ultimately a crucial element in the deal, one which is a prerequisite for future implementation of that very deal,"" he said.

Not only did Mr Netanyahu give alleged details of Project Amad, the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons programme reportedly mothballed in 2003, but he said the project had continued at the Iranian defence ministry.

He quoted the head of the alleged programme as saying ""special activities"" would continue ""under the title of scientific know-how developments"".

Such work continued this year, Mr Netanyahu said, without giving evidence.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents proved ""beyond any doubt"" that Iran had not told the truth.

Donald Trump has asked for permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment.

He has warned the US will abandon the deal on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress address his concerns.

What about other key players?

But the trip , which begins Wednesday morning when Mr. Obama lands in Tel Aviv , is also about repairing relations with another audience that will be key to the president ’ s prospects for advancing important regional goals for his second term : the Israeli public .
“ This trip is very much focused on the public diplomacy side [ of relations with Israel ] , much less on the hard substance , ” says Natan Sachs , an expert in Israeli foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
The White House is calling a speech Obama will give to the Israeli public – with an audience made up largely of young people – the centerpiece of the president ’ s visit . “ The speech , ” Mr. Sachs says , “ is the vehicle for the president to make his reintroduction ” to a skeptical Israel .
Israelis , who never embraced Obama the way many other audiences around the world did , have never quite forgiven this American president for putting nearby Cairo on the list of sites for his first term ’ s signature global issues speeches – without even making a stop in Israel .
But Obama , with a speech that warms up his image among Israelis , would be able to win not just popularity points , but even critical support for US initiatives in the region , Sachs says .
“ For the Israelis , it ’ s not , ‘ What have you done for me lately , ’ it ’ s ‘ Do you love me ? ’ ” he says .
Further evidence that Obama is out to redefine Israelis ’ impression of him comes from two of the iconic Israeli sites he will visit on his trip : the exhibit of the Dead Sea scrolls , which is seen as Obama ’ s recognition of the Jewish people ’ s roots in Israel ; and the grave of Zionist visionary Theodor Herzl . Both stops are aimed at correcting the impression left from Obama ’ s Cairo speech that he sees Israel ’ s creation as the result of the Holocaust rather than a millennia-old right to ancient Jewish lands .
Obama is “ bound to get a bounce ” in Israel from his public diplomacy offensive , Sachs says , adding that improved public views of Obama could make a difference down the road .
“ The Israeli public will punish a prime minister who has a poor relationship with a popular American president , ” he says . Thus a more popular Obama could lead to “ a more pliant Netanyahu , ” he adds , for example on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
The sense that Obama ’ s trip is really more about improving the climate for future initiatives than about setting down an ambitious agenda is prominent in White House pre-trip commentary .
“ There are obviously going to be significant decisions in the months and years ahead about Iran , about Syria , about Israeli-Palestinian peace , ” says Ben Rhodes , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications . Discussions Obama will have with Israeli and other leaders “ can frame those decisions that ultimately will come down the line , ” he says . “ That 's the way in which the president is approaching the trip . ”
The perception of tilling the ground for the future is echoed by regional analysts .
“ This is a down-payment trip , ” says Aaron David Miller , vice president for new initiatives at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington . “ If Obama ’ s stock goes up [ as a result of the visit ] in the eyes of the Israeli public , it will put additional pressure on Netanyahu . ”
The perception that Obama aims to make incremental progress with this trip – while laying the groundwork for a potentially brighter horizon – also applies at the regional level , others say . “ This trip is about managing Middle East problems , not solving them , ” says Haim Malka , deputy director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington .
Whether the issue is Iran or Syria or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Obama is visiting the region with no answers in his pocket but with an eye on keeping any of a number of crises from spinning out of control , Mr. Malka and other analysts say .
Iran is certain to be topic No . 1 for Prime Minister Netanyahu . Obama will underscore his view , which he laid out to Israeli television last week , that there is still a “ window ” for an international diplomatic effort to resolve concerns about Iran ’ s uranium enrichment program .
Yet even as Obama argues that diplomacy backed up by sanctions deserves more time , the Israeli leader “ will try to convince Obama that only threatening the use of force ” to stop Iran ’ s nuclear progress – and meaning it – will have an impact on the Iranians , Malka says .
And while the civil war in Syria may not get top billing , the gravity of the violence and the growing regional implications of the two-year-old conflict are quickly moving Syria up on the regional agenda , some experts say .
“ Syria is quite frankly the most burning issue they [ Obama and Netanyahu ] have on the table to discuss , ” says David Ottoway , a senior scholar at the Wilson Center . “ If this is a year of diplomacy toward Iran , it is also a year of trying to decide when and if the US and Israel are going to intervene ” in Syria to safeguard and stop the transfer of chemical weapons , he says .
Nor is Obama expected to lay out any new initiative for advancing the goal of a “ two-state solution ” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . One reason is that Obama ’ s “ fingers were burnt ” when he last tried to nudge the peace process along , says Martin Indyk , a former US ambassador to Israel who is now director of the foreign policy program at Brookings .
But even if Obama was inclined to kick-start the peace process with a renewed effort , the two sides in the conflict simply aren ’ t ready , Ambassador Indyk and others say . Netanyahu has just cobbled together a new coalition government ( after January elections ) that is largely focused on domestic economic and social issues . And the Palestinians remain deeply divided between Fatah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank , and Hamas in Gaza .
Obama will make the short trip from Jerusalem to Ramallah in “ the Beast , ” the president ’ s armored limousine , to meet with President Abbas on Thursday . But Obama won ’ t even attempt a charm offensive with the Palestinian public , instead making some time in his Ramallah schedule to meet informally with a group of Palestinian youths .
The president ’ s last stop on a four-day trip will be Jordan – and there again , there ’ s a strong sense that the visit is more about preparing for the “ significant decisions ” of the future than about solving problems today .
Obama will meet with King Abdullah , one of America ’ s closest Arab partners – but one whose country is increasingly feeling the weight of the Syrian refugee crisis . The growing humanitarian crisis only adds to tensions in Jordan over a struggling economy and steady – but by many accounts insufficient – political reforms .

The cash transfer , as reported by The Wall Street Journal , was the first installment paid in a $ 1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a failed 1979 arms deal dating from just before the Iranian Revolution .
The cash flown to Iran consisted of euros , Swiss francs , and other currencies because U.S. law forbids transacting American dollars with Iran . While the Obama administration denied the cash transfer was done to secure the release of the four Americans , GOP lawmakers said it was tantamount to “ ransom . ”
`` Paying ransom to kidnappers puts Americans even more at risk , '' Sen. Mark Kirk , R-Ill. , said in a statement . `` While Americans were relieved by Iran ’ s overdue release of illegally imprisoned American hostages , the White House ’ s policy of appeasement has led Iran to illegally seize more American hostages . ''
The four released Americans are Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian ; Amir Hekmati , a former U.S. Marine ; Christian pastor Saeed Abedini ; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari , whose case had not been publicized before the release .
State Department spokesman John Kirby said their release was on an entirely separate track from the settlement payment and , in an interview Wednesday with ███ , said any suggestion it was tied to ransom is “ utterly false . ”
“ We just don ’ t pay ransom . … This was not ransom , ” he said .
Kirby further said there was “ no secret ” about the payment .
“ It was their money , ” Kirby told ███ , noting the funds had been frozen and it “ made no sense for us to continue to drag out their claim. ” He argued the “ compromise ” struck with Iran worked to the “ taxpayers ’ benefit ” because potentially billions more could have been on the line .
In a written statement , Kirby said the negotiations over the Americans and over the settlement were even conducted `` by different teams on each side . '' He said : `` The funds that were transferred to Iran were related solely to the settlement of a long-standing claim at the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal at The Hague . ''
However , the Journal says U.S. officials acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible .

Speaking to his nation Monday night , Netanyahu said Israel intends to dismantle the tunnels between Gaza and Israel to prevent further Hamas infiltration .
`` Bravery and determination are needed to fight a terror group which seeks our destruction , '' Netanyahu said , adding that the operation would not end before the tunnels from the Gaza Strip are neutralized .
`` We need to be ready for a prolonged campaign , '' Netanyahu said . `` We will continue to act aggressively and responsibly until the mission is completed to protect our citizens , soldiers and children . ''
There is no war more just than this , '' he added .
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri struck a defiant tone in response to Netanyahu 's warnings .
`` His threats do not scare Hamas or the Palestinian people and the occupation will pay the price for the massacres against civilians and children , '' he said .
Earlier Monday , Netanyahu blasted a United Nations Security Council statement calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza , telling U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that it recognizes the needs of a “ murderous terrorist organization , ” and not Israeli security .
During a phone conversation with Ban , Netanyahu said the statement ignores Israel 's demands for the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip , a condition already established by previous interim agreements with the Palestinians , The Jerusalem Post reported .
“ The statement did not deal with the harm done to Israeli civilians , nor to the fact that Hamas turned Gaza civilians into human shields , ” Netanyahu said . He also complained that the statement made no mention of the fact that Hamas used U.N. facilities to attack Israeli civilians .
Israel accepted a UN request for a humanitarian cease-fire three times , he said , while Hamas violated each one .
In New York Sunday , the U.N. Security Council adopted the presidential statement calling for an `` immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire '' as Muslims began celebrating the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan .
The statement calls for both Israel and Hamas `` to accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond . '' It said this would allow for the delivery of urgently needed assistance . It is the council 's strongest statement yet on the Gaza war , but it was not a resolution and therefore not binding .
Drafted by Jordan , the Arab League 's representative on the Security Council , the statement ’ s text `` expresses grave concern regarding the deterioration in the situation as a result of the crisis related to Gaza and the loss of civilian lives and casualties , '' though it does not call for the Israeli military to pull out of the territory .
Netanyahu recommended to Ban that that the international community “ work to demilitarize Gaza , ” instead of having its money used by Hamas to build terror tunnels to attack Israel .
“ They are continuing to fire even now at Israel citizens , ” he said . “ Israel will continue to deal with the terror tunnels , which is only the first step in demilitarization . ”
Secretary-General Ban reiterated the need for an immediate unconditional humanitarian ceasefireat the U.N. Monday .
“ The people of Gaza have nowhere to run . They are trapped and besieged on a speck of land . Every area is a civilian area . Every home , every school , every refuge has become a target . The casualty and damage figures also raise serious concerns about proportionality , ” Ban told reporters .
President Obama telephoned Netanyahu Sunday to express his concern over the mounting Palestinian casualties . The White House said Obama reiterated that Israel has a right to defend itself and condemned Hamas ' rocket attacks .
Obama said a lasting peace will ultimately require a demilitarized Gaza and dismantling of terror groups . The U.S. president also pushed for an immediate , unconditional cease-fire that would allow Israeli and Palestinian civilians to return to normalcy .
Meanwhile , Israeli jets resumed airstrikes in the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas rocket fire hours after the U.N. Security Council ratified the statement .
Israel 's military said it struck two rocket launchers and a rocket manufacturing facility in central and northern Gaza after a rocket hit southern Israel . The rocket caused no damage or injuries .
The military said troops on the ground were continuing work to destroy the cross-border tunnels constructed by Hamas for attacks inside Israel . Israeli forces opened artillery fire on Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza in response to the rocket fired at Ashkelon , said the office of Israel 's military spokesman

The Gaza health ministry claims the 20-day war has killed more than 1,050 Palestinians , though it is unclear how many are civilians . Israel has lost 52 soldiers , as well as two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker killed by rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza , according to the Israeli military .
Palestinian U.N . Ambassador Riyad Mansour also criticized Monday ’ s U.N. statement , saying the council should have adopted a strong and legally binding resolution a long time ago demanding an immediate halt to Israel 's `` aggression , '' providing the Palestinian people with protection and lifting the siege in the Gaza Strip so goods and people can move freely .
Mansour also expressed hope that Israel will `` honor and respect '' a new humanitarian cease-fire , which the Palestinians hope will last `` for a long time '' so all outstanding issues can be addressed , especially the siege .
`` You can not keep 1.8 million Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip in this huge prison , '' he told reporters . `` That is a recipe for disaster . It is inhumane , and it has to be stopped and it has to be lifted . ''
Israel 's U.N . Ambassador Ron Prosor sidestepped several questions on whether Israel would accept a new humanitarian cease-fire , but stressed that it had agreed to five cease-fires since the conflict began .

Al-Khatib, a respected preacher who has led the Syrian National Coalition since its creation late last year, said in a statement posted on his Facebook page that he was making good on a vow to quit if certain undefined ""red lines"" were crossed.

""I am keeping my promise today and announcing my resignation from the National Coalition so that I can work with freedom that is not available inside the official institutions,"" he said.

He also blamed world powers for providing insufficient support for the rebel cause and complained that many ""international and regional parties"" insisted on pushing the opposition toward dialogue with the regime. Most opposition leaders and activists say Assad's regime has killed too many people to be part of a solution to the conflict.

The state of Egypt today is nothing less than expected, as Islamic radicalism has created outcomes of misconduct and inhumane criminality wherever it has existed. From casting disfiguring acids on to the faces of young girls to prevent them from getting an education to beheading human beings for merely having a different belief system to burning churches, the common denominator is extremism. Dreaming that respecting the ballot in Egypt was miraculously going to solve the problem is simply unrealistic. As exemplified by ballot results in Iraq and Afghanistan, elections are unable to prevent radicals from conducting heinous criminal acts.

In fact, since the Muslim Brotherhood has ruled Egypt, the United States itself has been attacked on several fronts. These include the invasion of the U.S. embassies in Cairo and in Benghazi, Libya, and the attack on the Boston Marathon in April.

Empowering the Islamists is bringing nothing but turmoil and disorder, and traditional Western approaches to end Islamic radicalism have failed. The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, and the problem remains, as threatening as always. The reason for this failure is essentially related to the inability of Westerners to grasp the ideological, psychological and cultural underpinnings of the problem.

The question remains whether the West should continue fighting this problem, persisting in pursuing current inefficient methods or to “leave the bread to the breadmakers,” meaning letting the people Egypt to battle Islamic radicalism effectively, themselves.

To understand this last phrase, it is vital to understand the pivotal role the Egyptian radical groups have played in creating the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism.

According to traditional Shariah law, jihad (or holy war against non-Muslims) was supposed to be a mission executed at a national level. Ordinary Muslims who wanted to pursue jihad could only do so under the banner of traditional war — between an Islamic nation against another nation. This understanding of jihad — while certainly violent — still did not allow individual Muslims to attack non-Muslims at the individual level as we see today in suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism. Dedicated Muslims who wanted to carry out jihad had to wait for an Islamic government to initiate traditional warfare. In the past few decades, Egyptian radical Islamic groups changed the theology of jihad so that it became an individual responsibility rather than a national responsibility. This theological modification has changed the phenomenon of jihad from a violent act committed via traditional warfare into a barbaric act of terrorism that individuals can undertake at any time.

In order to justify this theological modification, radical groups in Egypt used a hadith, or saying, from the Prophet Muhammad, which translates as “Whoever saw an un-Islamic thing, he must change it with hands,” and a Koranic verse that says, “Then fight in Allah’s cause — thou art held responsible only for thyself.” As if these weren’t enough, an Egyptian radical, Sheik Mohamed Abdul-Salam Farag, published a book in 1981, “The Forgotten Obligation,” in which he created the notion of violent jihad as being a sixth pillar (in addition to the five pillars, or religious obligations) that Muslims observe. Accordingly, performing the five pillars — without subsequently conducting jihad — became no longer sufficient enough to make one a pious Muslim.

The third theological modification that only worsened this phenomenon was also the work of Egyptian radical groups, which considered jihad a religious obligation that must be performed by every capable Muslim, instead of its traditional understanding as a religious obligation that is not a requirement for every individual Muslim.

Since the Egyptian people created this problem, they will consequently be more efficient in resolving it than the Western world. In fact, a saying spreading across Egyptian social-media outlets states, “We — Egyptians — created this radicalism, and we will end it here.”

In addition to traditional security measures by the police and army, Egyptians have been using very creative and effective measures to fight the radicals. These include ideological reforms, fatwas, or religious decrees condemning the radicals, and even jokes that ridicule them.

Now the question remains: Will the West be wise, and let the Egyptian people fight radical Islam in their own way, or will the West interfere with ineffective suggestions and useless approaches that will only empower radicalism? Will the Egyptian people listen to the advice from the West and remain spineless in their approach toward radicals, thus turning their country into another Iraq or Afghanistan, or will they ignore counterproductive advice?

The West has been trying unsuccessfully to fight radicalism since Sept. 11, 2001. It is better for the West to “leave the bread to the breadmakers” and let the Egyptians do the job.

Over his 30-year political career , Kerry has long been knocked for delivering more talk than results . Achieving a nuclear deal he first began pursuing even before he became secretary of state could redefine his place in history .
And that , Republican critics , foreign officials , and even some ex-administration officials say , is a big problem . Kerry ’ s eagerness for a deal , they argue , risks that the Iranians will seduce him into a bad one .
“ I don ’ t know how anyone who has observed Kerry over the past two years would think differently , ” says a former administration official who worked on Iran issues .
Kerry allies and administration officials strongly dispute the critique . On two previously unreported occasions this year , Kerry has threatened to break off negotiations , at least temporarily , according to a source familiar with the talks .
Speculation about Kerry ’ s mind-set has peaked in the home stretch of the negotiations , which the six powers in Vienna agreed Tuesday to extend until July 7 , a week past the original June 30 deadline .
Kerry has certainly worked relentlessly toward a deal . His many one-on-one meetings with Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif , for instance , have raised eyebrows among foreign diplomats who worry he may put too much stock in that relationship .
Kerry ’ s personal role has also become a focus of criticism from Capitol Hill Republicans .
“ I think he is desperate for an agreement , ” Republican Sen. John McCain told MSNBC in March . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker has told Kerry directly that “ it ’ s just as much of a legacy to walk away from a bad deal . ”
Kerry ’ s loyalists say the critique underestimates both Kerry ’ s fidelity to the national interest , as well as his political savvy .
“ Newsflash : If Kerry was satisfied with less , he ’ d already have taken it . He ’ s held out for more , ” said his former longtime chief of staff , David Wade . “ A deal that doesn ’ t get the job done isn ’ t something he ’ d ever stake his reputation on , period. ” Wade said Kerry would not agree to a deal he could not confidently defend from critics in Capitol Hill hearings .
The concern is that , in search of a historic accomplishment with his name on it , Kerry might succumb to wishful thinking . As a senator , Kerry was dogged by the critique that he authored few major bills over his 30-year career . He won the Democratic nomination in 2004 but lost his bid for the presidency . And since arriving at Foggy Bottom he has been frustrated in his efforts to contain Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and , above all , in his so-far fruitless quest for Middle East peace .
Allies say the conventional wisdom sells short his Senate and Foggy Bottom record , including his recent role brokering a peaceful resolution to Afghanistan ’ s disputed presidential election amid fears of a civil war .
Kerry has also shown that he can play chicken , as evidenced by two recent episodes from the nuclear talks .
In February , Kerry was in London with plans to head to Geneva the next morning for a meeting with Zarif when word came from U.S. negotiators already in Switzerland that the Iranians were dug in on a crucial point . Kerry scratched his early-morning departure and threatened to return to Washington ; the Iranians relented and Kerry flew to Switzerland later the following day for a productive session .
The talks were snagged on a different issue ahead of the political framework agreement struck in Lausanne , Switzerland on April 2 . Kerry and Zarif were the only top ministers present at the time , and after more than two days of arguing over the same point , Kerry was fed up . He arranged for an evening visit to Zarif ’ s hotel room , during which he warned the Iranian that he was prepared to tell other ministers flying in the next day to cancel their plans . The next morning , Zarif showed new flexibility on the point and the talks proceeded .
“ His first instinct is to find a creative solution , ” says a senior administration official . “ But he realizes when things are stuck and is perfectly willing to move on . ”
Others noted that the portrait of Kerry as a mark oversimplifies how the nuclear talks work . While Kerry spends hours in meetings with the Iranians , he is not the final arbiter of the U.S. position . His work is backstopped by top White House officials — and ultimately by President Barack Obama — who lays down U.S. negotiating red lines . “ It ’ s not as if he ’ s out there without a mandate to just see what he comes up with , ” said Phil Gordon , who left as the White House ’ s top Middle East official last month .
In contrast to Kerry ’ s countless photo-ops and press statements , cameras rarely capture the activity of White House officials who manage the talks from afar . That includes copious planning meetings involving officials from across the government — including the departments of Defense , Treasury and Energy — before each new round , as well late-night sessions in the West Wing bridging the time zones between Washington and Switzerland .
During peak periods of the talks , Kerry repeatedly calls into the White House — sometimes speaking several times a day to National Security Adviser Susan Rice — to report back on Iran ’ s latest position and receive guidance on the next steps . The night before the April agreement , Kerry spoke by phone from Lausanne with Rice and Obama in Rice ’ s West Wing office . Following that meeting , according to a person familiar with the events , a core team spent most of the night at the White House going line by line through the proposed framework and sending edits back to Kerry ’ s team .
At key moments , Kerry has also stepped into a secure anti-surveillance tent and donned a microphone headset for a video-conference link to Situation Room meetings with a wider group of officials led by Obama .
“ The president ’ s going to decide if this is a good deal or not , ” said Gordon .
Of course , many critics of the talks fret that Obama faces much the same pressure as Kerry for a legacy-making achievement , especially in the realm of foreign policy , where Obama has faced an unrelenting string of crises in recent months . A new article in the conservative Weekly Standard attacking Obama ’ s “ capitulation ” to Iran notes that Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes has likened an Iran deal to Obamacare in its importance to the administration .
Obama challenged the idea that he is overeager for a nuclear deal in an interview last month with The Atlantic ’ s Jeffrey Goldberg . “ Twenty years from now … [ if ] Iran has a nuclear weapon , it ’ s my name on this , ” Obama said , adding : “ I have a personal interest in locking this down . ”
But Kerry ’ s own investment is also huge . He has pursued a nuclear deal since he was a senator , well before the administration ’ s direct diplomacy got underway : As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Kerry secretly flew to Muscat in November 2011 , where he asked the Sultan of Oman to help broker talks between Washington and Tehran . That set the stage for the administration ’ s first direct contacts with Iranian officials on the nuclear question .
Striking a deal in Vienna this summer will require persuading Iran ’ s supreme leader to backtrack on his own stated red lines , including on the pace of sanctions relief and access of inspectors to Iranian military sites and nuclear scientists .
Dennis Ross , another former senior Middle East aide under Obama with long experience in diplomatic negotiations said the key to effective deal making is “ being able to show you have a genuine interest in a deal but can live without one . ”
“ We should show little interest in a deadline and focus exclusively on our essential needs , ” Ross added . If Iran won ’ t meet those needs , Ross said , then Kerry should “ suggest a pause — but with the proviso that we will also reassess where we are , with the understanding that our positions are likely to harden . ”
Walking away from a deal would surely be a disappointment for Kerry . But it could , at least , put the questions about his motives to rest .","As he meets with Iranian officials in search of a nuclear deal in the coming days, John Kerry may sense another presence in Vienna’s Palais Coburg hotel: his legacy.

As The Associated Press writes , `` some former militant extremists [ had ] vowed to fight . '' NPR 's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson , who is in Cairo , tells our Newscast Desk that they planned to march through the city 's streets in a `` day of rage '' to protest both the removal of the president and the reported arrest of key Brotherhood leaders . Authorities accuse them of inciting violence in the days leading up to Morsi 's removal .
By nighttime in Cairo , the military had deployed armored vehicles as clashes in the city escalated . The AP — citing Egypt 's Health Ministry — reported that at least 10 people have died in violence across the country .
The Guardian , which is among the news outlets live blogging events in Egypt , says the arrival of armored vehicles on the 6 October bridge in Cairo may have tamped down battles there between pro- and anti-Morsi groups .
There was also word from State TV that the Islamist-led upper house of parliament had been dissolved .
Al-Jazeera adds that `` meanwhile , Egypt 's military has appealed for conciliation and warned against unrest , as police rounded up senior Islamists . ''
The army , as the BBC says , has pledged to allow `` peaceful protests . '' Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said their followers will not resort to violence , but have also warned that things could quickly get out of control .
We 'll keep an eye on the news from Egypt and update as warranted .
4:20 p.m . ET . Mohamed Tawfik , Egypt 's ambassador to the United States , tells NPR 's Robert Siegel , that what has happened in his country is not a coup . Tawfik says the military 's action is an expression of the people 's will .
The ambassador says the Egyptian people want an inclusive , democratic process and that the government of ousted President Mohammed Morsi was following a different path :
`` His actions was to gather as much power as possible in his own hands , to put members of his own organization in all the key positions in Egypt to be able to control all aspects of government , the media , the judiciary , the police , even religious organizations , in a way that would ensure that his group would remain in power for decades , irrespective of the democratic process . And that is what really scared the vast majority of Egyptians . ''
Despite ascribing undemocratic motives to Morsi and his allies , Tawfik also tells Siegel that the Muslim Brotherhood can and should join again in the democratic process when it moves forward :
`` They have to acknowledge that they made mistakes . And they have to decide that they want to move move forward . Everybody in Egypt accepts that there must be a future for the Muslim Brotherhood within the democratic process . We want an inclusive process . And I strongly urge them to participate in that process . They 're invited to do so . ''
3:27 p.m . ET . The AP now reports the Egyptian Health Ministry has raised the number of dead in clashes today to 10 people , with 210 injured .
3:15 p.m . ET . Egyptian Health Ministry is now saying that six people have died in clashes around the country .
The AP quotes Ministry official Khaled el-Khatib saying that four people have been killed in Cairo and two elsewhere , with 180 wounded .

(Click here for updates.)

After ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi's supporters in the Muslim Brotherhood called for mass protests Friday, there were reports of violence in the streets of Cairo and some other cities.

As The Associated Press writes, ""some former militant extremists [had] vowed to fight."" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who is in Cairo, tells our Newscast Desk that they planned to march through the city's streets in a ""day of rage"" to protest both the removal of the president and the reported arrest of key Brotherhood leaders. Authorities accuse them of inciting violence in the days leading up to Morsi's removal.

By nighttime in Cairo, the military had deployed armored vehicles as clashes in the city escalated. The AP — citing Egypt's Health Ministry — reported that at least 10 people have died in violence across the country.

The Guardian, which is among the news outlets live blogging events in Egypt, says the arrival of armored vehicles on the 6 October bridge in Cairo may have tamped down battles there between pro- and anti-Morsi groups.

There was also word from State TV that the Islamist-led upper house of parliament had been dissolved.

Al-Jazeera adds that ""meanwhile, Egypt's military has appealed for conciliation and warned against unrest, as police rounded up senior Islamists.""

The army, as the BBC says, has pledged to allow ""peaceful protests."" Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said their followers will not resort to violence, but have also warned that things could quickly get out of control.

We'll keep an eye on the news from Egypt and update as warranted.

UPDATES

4:20 p.m. ET. Mohamed Tawfik, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, tells NPR's Robert Siegel, that what has happened in his country is not a coup. Tawfik says the military's action is an expression of the people's will.

The ambassador says the Egyptian people want an inclusive, democratic process and that the government of ousted President Mohammed Morsi was following a different path:

""His actions was to gather as much power as possible in his own hands, to put members of his own organization in all the key positions in Egypt to be able to control all aspects of government, the media, the judiciary, the police, even religious organizations, in a way that would ensure that his group would remain in power for decades, irrespective of the democratic process. And that is what really scared the vast majority of Egyptians.""

Despite ascribing undemocratic motives to Morsi and his allies, Tawfik also tells Siegel that the Muslim Brotherhood can and should join again in the democratic process when it moves forward:

""They have to acknowledge that they made mistakes. And they have to decide that they want to move move forward. Everybody in Egypt accepts that there must be a future for the Muslim Brotherhood within the democratic process. We want an inclusive process. And I strongly urge them to participate in that process. They're invited to do so.""

3:27 p.m. ET. The AP now reports the Egyptian Health Ministry has raised the number of dead in clashes today to 10 people, with 210 injured.

3:15 p.m. ET. Egyptian Health Ministry is now saying that six people have died in clashes around the country.

The AP quotes Ministry official Khaled el-Khatib saying that four people have been killed in Cairo and two elsewhere, with 180 wounded. The deaths and injuries occurred in a series of nationwide confrontations between opponents and backers of ousted President Mohammed Morsi, as well as security forces.

1:30 p.m. ET. Morsi Supporters Head Toward Tahrir Square, Where Those Who Opposed The President Are Gathered:

Her research has become especially relevant in the wake of Syria 's civil war , in which a number of foreign countries are sponsoring parties to the conflict , and she has written about the dangers of arming rebel groups fighting against Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad .
I spoke to Borghard about the Obama administration 's plan to arm moderate Syrian rebels fighting the terrorist group ISIS .
Amanda Taub : Is there a pattern — or patterns — that you can typically see proxy wars following ? Are there specific problems or pitfalls that are common to them ?
Erica Borghard : What makes proxy wars unique is that there 's this vast asymmetry on a number of fronts .
Proxy wars involve states , who contract out portions of their security to non-state actors . They provide arms , and resources , and training , and money to non-state groups , with the idea that those groups will fight on their behalf and bear more of the human cost of war .
The more informal and covert you get , the more problems you end up having . You do n't have the same kind of enforcement mechanisms , the same kind of training mechanisms , the same kind of oversight that you have when you have more formal alliance agreement . The things that you have to do to maintain plausible deniability undermine your ability to influence your proxy group , and get your proxy to do what you want them to do .
AT : Are there pros and cons that you see with regard to the current strategy in Syria ? Are there things that you think the U.S. should be wary about here ?
EB : The model that we are , from my understanding , currently trying to replicate in Syria is a model that we have been moderately successful at — depending on how you define success — over the past 15 or so years .
This is what 's often called the `` Afghan model '' in the literature . It 's called the Afghan model because we debuted it in its fullest in Afghanistan 2001 , but it 's just the idea that Western air power , coupled with limited special operations forces on the ground , working in conjunction with local allies , can be a way to sort of cheaply , and with less human cost to us , achieve a limited political objective .
The initial stage of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 — this is before we had a large ground presence in Afghanistan — was special operations forces working with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and Western air power to topple the Taliban .
We replicated this model in Libya , where we had special operations forces on the ground working with the Libyan rebels to topple [ Libyan leader Moammar ] Qaddafi , along with American and NATO airpower . So this is a model that we have been testing out in various theaters , and which , it seems to me , we are trying to replicate in Iraq and in Syria .
When you study these things for enough time , you end up , unfortunately , wearing a pessimist hat most of the time
But , of course , Iraq and Syria offer unique and different challenges . There are debates about how effective this kind of model can be . Some scholars have argued that if you do n't have local allies on the ground who are at least as skilled as your adversaries , then air power can not have a decisive impact on the outcome of the conflict .
The unique challenge in Syria is that Syria is a multi-party civil war . So , unlike in Libya , where we were allied with the Libyan rebels against Qadaffi 's regime , in Syria , you have many parties to the conflict . And the ones we 're choosing to arm and aid are probably among the weaker parties .
You do n't just have a state verses a rebel group , you have multiple rebel groups , with multiple interests , almost all of whom have access to their own external support . So you have a series of proxy relationships that are existing here . Plus you have the Assad government , which is being supported by Iran . You have many different external actors , all of which have their own interests at stake , and , probably have more at stake than the United States does .
The ones we 're choosing to arm and aid are probably the weaker parties
Then , of course , you have the issue of Iraq . In Syria , my understanding is that we have a relatively limited objective , which is really degrading and ultimately defeating ISIS . Whereas in Iraq , we are not only trying to degrade and defeat ISIS , but also assist the Iraqi government in becoming a relatively stable , sovereign government that can actually have territorial sovereignty and defend its borders and have some inclusive , political routine that does not alienate the Sunni population , which is ultimately the political cause of what 's currently happening .
AT : What is the worst case scenario , here ? What are the things that the US should be worried might happen ?
EB : I do n't want come across as being overly pessimistic , because it 's not clear that there will necessarily be a terrible outcome to all of this , but the danger is something to consider .
In Syria , the moral question is : who do we enable by defeating ISIS ? Let 's say we do defeat , we do degrade , the capabilities of ISIS so that ISIS does not pose a threat to Iraqi sovereignty , and does not pose a threat to our allies . Who do we empower ? What are the second and third order effects of that ? Do we strengthen Assad , who is a cruel and reckless dictator who has systematically slaughtered Syrians ? Then , what is our culpability in that ? That 's the moral worst-case outcome .
From a more strategic or an operational perspective , the worst case is that we have to expend far more resources than we anticipated in order to achieve our objectives .
The worst case is that we have to put `` real '' American troops on the ground in Syria , which I just ca n't even imagine . It 's very hard for me to imagine a world where that happens .
Another bad possible outcome is that we arm Syrian rebels and those arms get in the hands of the very people we 're trying to destroy , or a group that we find to be , perhaps , even more threatening than ISIS . There could be a concern of blowback — that is another potential worst-case outcome . I 'm trying to put my pessimist hat on .
AT : I 'll let you have your optimist hat in a minute .
EB : Another possible bad thing is that [ right now ] you just have this sort of low-level civil war type stuff brewing in Iraq . But Iraq could break out into another round of sectarian conflict .
the long-term implications , the second and third order effects , have not been so dandy
Who knows what that will do , how that will change the calculus of Iran , and to what extent they will get drawn into , even more , into Iraq than they already are ? Which is very , very heavily . Iran has considerable influence on the government in Baghdad , and has been very involved in Iraq for decades . If Iraq erupts into this sectarian conflict , do the Iranians get drawn in ? Who else might get drawn in ? What kind of regional conflagration could result out of that ?
Unfortunately , in this line of business , I could just enumerate all the various possible ways that things could go wrong .
AT : Let 's shift away from your pessimist hat , then , for a minute , and I 'll let you put your optimist hat on .
EB : Putting on the optimist hat , [ through proxy war ] it 's possible that you can outsource a lot of the costs to your allies , a lot of the human cost to your allies , and still achieve your political objectives — assuming you can maintain control of the situation .
In Syria , that would look like : we arm and train moderate Syrian rebels . With American air power , we target ISIS 's positions from the air , while our local allies target ISIS 's positions from the ground , and we degrade the capabilities of ISIS to the point that they ca n't threaten the US or American interests or allies . That would be a successful case of a proxy war .
And now I transition back to putting my pessimist hat on . When you study these things for enough time , you end up , unfortunately , wearing a pessimist hat most of the time .
In Libya , we underestimated how long it would take and what kind of capabilities the mission would require because Qaddafi 's forces adapted
This gets at something I said earlier , about how we define success : In Libya , we successfully armed and trained the Libyan rebels , coupled with American and allied air power . We were able to prevent genocide in Benghazi , and also have the added bonus of overthrowing Qadaffi . And actually , that was n't part of the original mandate , and was not the justification for intervention . Nevertheless , it was a perk — two for one deal ! Stop genocide and overthrow a dictator !
However , the long-term implications , the second and third order effects , have not been so dandy . We overthrew Qadaffi , but in his place , we now have various tribes and warlords who have staked claims to little fiefdoms . Libya is mostly ungoverned — the central government has very little power , and ca n't project power .
Libya has become an attractive destination for nefarious characters around the world , and this could potentially undermine American and allied security more than Qadaffi did . So , even if we 're successful in achieving our limited objectives , what are the long-term consequences of these kinds of interventions ? That 's something we should consider .
AT : Do you think that the US would have a lower tolerance for Syria being the kind of place that Libya is now , because of where its located ?
EB : You would think we would , but the Syrian civil war has been festering for a number of years , and it 's really taken a crisis in Iraq to get involved Syria . It was not until ISIS threatened Iraqi sovereignty that we decided to expand the effort in Syria .
Something else that 's important to take into account is what kinds of capabilities will we need to achieve these objectives and how long can we expect to be engaged .
In Libya , we underestimated how long it would take and what kind of capabilities the mission would require because Qaddafi 's forces adapted . So , in these operations , we 're dealing with an adversary that 's human and that can respond and adapt , not a brick wall .
This is especially important when it comes to the use of air power . It 's really easy to target troops when they 're massing and open — then you have a clearly identifiable target that you can hit .
But as soon as Qadaffi 's forces saw that the United States was doing that , they dispersed , and used cover and concealment . Qadaffi 's soldiers at some point switched to using civilian vehicles for transportation , and they actually painted the roofs of their vehicles with rebel flags to avoid being targeted by NATO . So they dispersed , they adapted . We can anticipate that ISIS would do similar types of things .
Initially , we are certainly hitting `` command and control '' : targets that are actual buildings and facilities , that are for storage , for logistics , for command and control . But once we run out of those , and we 're trying to target actual troops , they 're not going to be massing in the open .
Once they face the brunt of American air power , they 're going disperse . And then it will just much more difficult . And then the skills of our allies on the ground will matter much more .
That will be one of the crucial determinants of the success of the mission . Once the adversaries adapt , how skilled are our local ground troop allies going to be at engaging the enemy ?","Political scientist Dr. Erica Borghard has spent years studying the pitfalls and benefits of ""proxy wars"" — in which one country wages war in another country indirectly, by arming, training, or otherwise supporting local armed groups.

In Libya, we underestimated how long it would take and what kind of capabilities the mission would require because Qaddafi's forces adapted. So, in these operations, we're dealing with an adversary that's human and that can respond and adapt, not a brick wall.

This is especially important when it comes to the use of air power. It's really easy to target troops when they're massing and open — then you have a clearly identifiable target that you can hit.

But as soon as Qadaffi's forces saw that the United States was doing that, they dispersed, and used cover and concealment. Qadaffi's soldiers at some point switched to using civilian vehicles for transportation, and they actually painted the roofs of their vehicles with rebel flags to avoid being targeted by NATO. So they dispersed, they adapted. We can anticipate that ISIS would do similar types of things.

Initially, we are certainly hitting ""command and control"": targets that are actual buildings and facilities, that are for storage, for logistics, for command and control. But once we run out of those, and we're trying to target actual troops, they're not going to be massing in the open.

Once they face the brunt of American air power, they're going disperse. And then it will just much more difficult. And then the skills of our allies on the ground will matter much more.

That will be one of the crucial determinants of the success of the mission. Once the adversaries adapt, how skilled are our local ground troop allies going to be at engaging the enemy?",www.vox.com,left,DkNUZKxb22oaheh9

The U.S. military conducted several strikes against Sunni extremist militants near Irbil in Iraq Friday, in what the White House calls a limited engagement.

""Military officials say unmanned aircraft struck a terrorist mortar position,"" NPR's Tamara Keith reports, ""and then when the fighters returned, they were attacked as well. Later, four FA-18 aircraft struck an ISIS convoy and another mortar position using eight laser-guided bombs.""

""White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest says U.S. military involvement will be limited,"" Tamara adds, ""but he couldn't offer an end date. He also said that if Iraqis are able to form an inclusive government, the U.S. role could even expand.""

Earnest also stated that the U.S. won't be resuming a combat role in Iraq.

This morning, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said on Twitter that the U.S. hit artillery being used against Kurdish forces near U.S. personnel. The Washington Post and The New York Times report two F-18 aircraft dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs on a mobile artillery target near Irbril.

On Thursday, President Obama authorized both humanitarian drops and airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq. This is significant because it marks the first major military intervention since U.S. troops left Iraq at the end of 2011.

Thursday night, U.S. cargo planes, escorted by F-18 fighter jets, dropped 5,300 gallons of water and more than 8,000 ready-to-eat meals on a mountain range in northern in Iraq to help a group of about 40,000 Yazidi people who were expelled by Sunni militants also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

U.S. Military Strikes Sunni Extremist Fighters In Iraq Listen · 4:49 4:49

With that, here's what you need to know about what's happening in Iraq and the U.S. intervention in that country.

-- A Narrow Mission:

On Morning Edition, NPR's Tom Bowman said U.S. officials reiterated that this is a very ""narrowly drawn mission"" designed to prevent the slaughter of thousands of civilians and to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.

The officials made clear, Tom said, that the U.S. ""is not launching a U.S. campaign against Islamic fighters.""

Tom adds that this is in line with Obama's doctrine of not getting ""entangled in long-term wars.""

-- How This All Started:

Just in case you've been checked out: The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) gained big-time notoriety back in June, when its insurgents overtook large parts of Mosul.

While the group has been responsible for most of the violent attacks in Iraq, their taking of Mosul sent a message that they were very organized and that the Iraqi government was in real trouble.

Through the months, ISIS continued its march in Iraq, and in late June it declared its intention to form a new caliphate, a system of rule that ended nearly 100 years ago with the fall of the Ottoman Empire. With that announcement, ISIS was renamed simply the Islamic State.

Reports from human rights groups painted a grim picture of ruthless destruction and the systematic expulsion and killing of religious minorities, who were told to convert, flee or be killed.

Over the past week or so, reports started to surface that the Islamic State had captured the Mosul dam, which controls the water supply to a large amount of territory. Thursday, according to multiple news outlets, that finally came to pass. The New York Times said it was a ""potentially catastrophic development for Iraq's civilian population.""

-- Big Questions:

During his speech to the nation Thursday night, Obama said when the United States has the ability to stop thousands of civilians from ""being wiped out,"" the U.S. has the responsibility to do something about it.

""Earlier this week, one Iraqi cried that there is no one coming to help,"" Obama said. ""Well, today America is coming to help.""

But, as the Times reports today, this action brings up a lot of big questions:

""For Mr. Obama, who has steadfastly avoided being drawn into the sectarian furies of the Middle East, the decision raises a host of difficult questions, injecting the American military into Iraq's broader political struggle — something Mr. Obama said he would not agree to unless Iraq's three main ethnic groups agreed on a national unity government. ""The decision could also open Mr. Obama to charges that he is willing to use American military might to protect Iraqi Christians and other religious minorities but not to prevent the slaughter of Muslims by other Muslims, either in Iraq or neighboring Syria.""

-- Some Homework:

We'll leave you with some homework. It's a piece by Stephen M. Walt, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard University, in Foreign Policy this morning.

Yes, the premise of his piece — essentially that the U.S. needs to sit this one out and watch it all burn from afar — is controversial, but his explanation offers some rich context.

ET . )
In what looks to be the bloodiest day since the July 3 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi , dozens of people in Cairo were killed Wednesday as government forces moved to clear Morsi 's supporters from sites where they have been camped .
By evening , the ministry of health reported 275 people had been killed and 2,001 had been injured across the country . The government said 43 policemen had been killed .
At the same time , Egyptian Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei — a Nobel Peace Prize laureate — announced his resignation . He tied his departure to his disapproval of Wednesday 's violence , which was dominated by what witnesses said were the gunshots , tear gas and other uses of force by security forces :
`` I saw that there were peaceful alternatives to dispersing this social clash and there were acceptable solutions proposed to lead us towards national reconciliation , '' ElBaradei wrote in his resignation letter . `` It is now difficult for me to continue to bear responsibility for decisions that I do not agree with and to which I fear their consequences and I can not bear responsibility for a single drop of blood before God , before my conscience , and before my citizens , especially as I believe that the bloodshed could 've been avoidable . `` Thus unfortunately those who gain from what happened today are those who call for violence , terror , and the more radical groups . And you will remember what I have told you and I delegate my matter to God . ''
The interim government , meanwhile , declared a state of emergency and blamed Morsi supporters for the violence . Egypt 's interim Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi defended the government 's actions , saying the crackdown was necessary to restore security and he also praised the police for self-restraint .
Shortly after 12:30 p.m . ET , the White House said it :
`` Strongly condemns the use of violence against protesters in Egypt . We extend our condolences to the families of those who have been killed , and to the injured . We have repeatedly called on the Egyptian military and security forces to show restraint , and for the government to respect the universal rights of its citizens , just as we have urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully . `` Violence will only make it more difficult to move Egypt forward on a path to lasting stability and democracy , and runs directly counter to the pledges by the interim government to pursue reconciliation . We also strongly oppose a return to a State of Emergency law , and call on the government to respect basic human rights such as freedom of peaceful assembly , and due process under the law . The world is watching what is happening in Cairo . We urge the government of Egypt — and all parties in Egypt — to refrain from violence and resolve their differences peacefully . ''
On 'Morning Edition ' just after 10 a.m . ET : NPR 's Leila Fadel reports from Cairo Listen · 4:22 4:22
In a televised statement , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for a political resolution , saying that `` violence is simply not a solution in Egypt or anywhere else . ''
Kerry called what happened Wednesday `` deplorable '' and said the U.S. `` strongly opposes '' a `` return to a state of emergency . ''
The day 's events were almost sure to renew calls from some U.S. lawmakers that aid to Egypt — much of it to that country 's military — be cut or suspended .
As the sounds of gunfire rang out across the city and smoke billowed , Leila told Morning Edition host David Greene that even though it was `` impossible to confirm '' the number of deaths because journalists were n't being allowed to get close to the action , it appeared there had been a `` bloodbath . '' At one hospital she visited , Leila added in messages to the NPR newsroom , she counted at least 37 bodies .
Although the vast majority of the victims were Egyptians , at least two journalists were among those killed . One was a Sky News photographer , according to that news outlet . The other was a reporter for the Dubai-based Gulf News .

(We most recently updated the top of this post at 5:08 p.m. ET.)

In what looks to be the bloodiest day since the July 3 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi, dozens of people in Cairo were killed Wednesday as government forces moved to clear Morsi's supporters from sites where they have been camped.

By evening, the ministry of health reported 275 people had been killed and 2,001 had been injured across the country. The government said 43 policemen had been killed.

At the same time, Egyptian Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei — a Nobel Peace Prize laureate — announced his resignation. He tied his departure to his disapproval of Wednesday's violence, which was dominated by what witnesses said were the gunshots, tear gas and other uses of force by security forces:

""I saw that there were peaceful alternatives to dispersing this social clash and there were acceptable solutions proposed to lead us towards national reconciliation,"" ElBaradei wrote in his resignation letter. ""It is now difficult for me to continue to bear responsibility for decisions that I do not agree with and to which I fear their consequences and I cannot bear responsibility for a single drop of blood before God, before my conscience, and before my citizens, especially as I believe that the bloodshed could've been avoidable. ""Thus unfortunately those who gain from what happened today are those who call for violence, terror, and the more radical groups. And you will remember what I have told you and I delegate my matter to God.""

The interim government, meanwhile, declared a state of emergency and blamed Morsi supporters for the violence. Egypt's interim Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi defended the government's actions, saying the crackdown was necessary to restore security and he also praised the police for self-restraint.

The events brought a rebuke from the Obama administration.

Shortly after 12:30 p.m. ET, the White House said it:

""Strongly condemns the use of violence against protesters in Egypt. We extend our condolences to the families of those who have been killed, and to the injured. We have repeatedly called on the Egyptian military and security forces to show restraint, and for the government to respect the universal rights of its citizens, just as we have urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully. ""Violence will only make it more difficult to move Egypt forward on a path to lasting stability and democracy, and runs directly counter to the pledges by the interim government to pursue reconciliation. We also strongly oppose a return to a State of Emergency law, and call on the government to respect basic human rights such as freedom of peaceful assembly, and due process under the law. The world is watching what is happening in Cairo. We urge the government of Egypt — and all parties in Egypt — to refrain from violence and resolve their differences peacefully.""

On 'Morning Edition' just after 10 a.m. ET: NPR's Leila Fadel reports from Cairo Listen · 4:22 4:22

In a televised statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for a political resolution, saying that ""violence is simply not a solution in Egypt or anywhere else.""

Kerry called what happened Wednesday ""deplorable"" and said the U.S. ""strongly opposes"" a ""return to a state of emergency.""

The day's events were almost sure to renew calls from some U.S. lawmakers that aid to Egypt — much of it to that country's military — be cut or suspended.

As the sounds of gunfire rang out across the city and smoke billowed, Leila told Morning Edition host David Greene that even though it was ""impossible to confirm"" the number of deaths because journalists weren't being allowed to get close to the action, it appeared there had been a ""bloodbath."" At one hospital she visited, Leila added in messages to the NPR newsroom, she counted at least 37 bodies.

Although the vast majority of the victims were Egyptians, at least two journalists were among those killed. One was a Sky News photographer, according to that news outlet. The other was a reporter for the Dubai-based Gulf News.

In an interview with All Things Considered's Robert Siegel, the Egyptian ambassador to the United States Mohamed Tawfik said the clashes started after security forces surrounded the two main sit-ins in Cairo.

""Members of the Muslim Brotherhood started shooting at police,"" he said, which meant they had to move in quicker than first planned.

Robert pressed him, asking him if that justified the killing of women and peaceful protesters and if that justified the snipers NPR's Leila Fadel had seen during her reporting.

Tawfik said there was conflicting information — that it was the Muslim Brotherhood who had sent snipers to the rooftops. The security forces, he said, lost 43 policemen, after all.

""The sit-ins,"" he said, ""had become a source of criminality,"" so action had to be taken.

We'll continue to focus on reports from authorities and news outlets with reporters at or near the scene and update as more information comes in.

Story Continued Below

International negotiators in Switzerland ran up against their deadline for the Iran nuclear talks — and then kept on running, insisting that there’s enough reason to believe that maybe they’ll get far enough on Wednesday, or maybe a couple of days after that. How many, they won’t say. What happens if that’s not enough, no one seems to fully know.

Obama’s been talking about getting an Iran deal since he first ran for president in 2008 and taking heat for it from the beginning. In year seven of his presidency, it has emerged as a key lingering piece of the transformational foreign policy he wants as his legacy and become central to dealings across a region where every week brings a new crumbling country, each with a new kaleidoscope of shifting alliances to deal with.

Obama’s decision to back down from the threat of strikes on Syria in 2013 is still seen as revealing Obama’s unwillingness to fight by many of the same regional leaders who fear he’s willing to give away too much to get an agreement now.

An Iran deal, in the White House’s view, simultaneously has no direct connection to the rest of the trouble in the Middle East and is inextricably tied to everything the administration is facing. That includes a fractured relationship with the Israeli prime minister who, along with the Saudis, is strongly opposed to the Iran talks; the United States and Saudi Arabia backing the rebels in Syria while Iran backs Bashar Assad; the Houthis in Yemen against Al Qaeda while the Saudis attack; all while Americans and Iranians align to fight off Islamic State in Iraq.

“If a deal happens, even in overtime, that is a meaningful contribution to Middle East security. Period. There is uncertainty about Iran’s long-term trajectory and its interests in places like Yemen, Syria and Iraq. The region as a whole is concerned about Iran, and rightfully so. But like it or not, Iran gets a vote in what happens,” said former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. “The negotiations have established a credible channel for the U.S. and Iran to manage areas of overlapping interests and areas of conflicting interests.”

Obama was briefed late Tuesday by the negotiating team via video conference, the White House said.

Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that discussions have stalled only over issues related to the nuclear program, not other disputes in the region.

Before the West Wing gets to sorting out what happens next, Obama and his aides are trying to sort out where they are now — and how long they’ll be in this limbo. Going a couple of days past the deadline, goes the thinking, would be a lot different than going two weeks, and not just because Congress will be back in session by then.

The broader narrative of instability in the region is already problematic, the White House knows, and failing to get an agreement after all this buildup would make that worse.

They also know that it’ll be hard to claim a win even if they somehow squeak out a deal that Obama considers a good one. Any excitement will be drowned out by all other instability in the region and by the people in Congress and around the world who will attack any agreement.

It’s not like Obama was ever planning an Iran talks victory tour. The best case that the administration was expecting was for Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to be cautious downers while the Europeans popped the corks on another uncertain win for international diplomacy.

But beyond repeating their cliché that “no deal is better than a bad deal,” there’s no sense of what getting no Iran deal would mean, or what Obama’s prepared to do if there isn’t one.

All of this comes as the administration is grappling with the reality of Tehran asserting itself in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, on top of its long-held presence in Lebanon through Hezbollah. Just Tuesday, the White House announced the lifting of the yearold hold on military aid to Egypt.

“The administration’s in the incongruous position, in a way, of trying to very sensibly see if we can keep them away from a nuclear weapon,” said Nicholas Burns, an undersecretary of state under President George W. Bush, who said he still believes a deal will happen. “At the same time, the U.S. is going to have to push back on Iran by becoming a more overt leader in the region.”

The military option, many believe, is only “on the table,” as Obama and his aides keep promising, in the loosest, most metaphysical sense. There is a military, and technically Obama does have the option of using it, but he’s not going to start a war.

Obama has kept threatening to walk away, with Earnest saying Tuesday that the president is prepared to quit talks before the June 30 deadline (which is really, really a hard deadline, he insisted). But the president has invested too much of his credibility, time and energy over too many years to make many believe he actually would.

Obama’s “very interested in these serious talks, he recognizes the stakes here, but what’s also true is that it’s time for Iran to make some serious decisions,” Earnest said Tuesday at the White House.

Republicans didn’t wait for midnight in Lausanne to begin piling on.

“Another Obama red line comes and goes,” came the hit from the Republican National Committee.

“It’s time for the United States to regain the upper hand and quit negotiating out of weakness,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has positioned himself as a chief antagonist of the administration on Iran.

“I have no doubt that the Iranian negotiating team in Lausanne wants to get a deal.

The Benghazi attack has become a political flashpoint in Washington

Federal authorities have filed the first criminal charges in the investigation of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, people briefed on the matter said.

Several suspects charged in the armed assault last September 11 include prominent Libyan militia figure Ahmed Abu Khattala, the sources said. Other identities were not disclosed.

The counts initially sought months ago in New York are still under seal, according to the sources.

The investigation of the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans continues, these people said, as investigators try to build their case against Khattala and others who authorities believe were involved.

Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment as did FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald in New York.

The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.

But word of the development comes as the Justice Department has come in for sharp criticism from congressional lawmakers about the pace and progress of the investigation.

Attorney General Eric Holder had earlier this year promised them that the Justice Department would soon make public what actions it would take.

Republicans have demanded more aggressive steps from the incoming FBI Director James Comey.

But people close to the case said the investigation has moved significantly in recent months.

In that time, the FBI has released photos of what it called persons of interest who were present during the attacks, seeking tips from the Libyan public.

It couldn't be learned when the United States plans to announce the charges or whether there is any intention to try to detain Khattala or the others.

None of those briefed on the matter would discuss the precise counts.

In a recent interview with CNN's Arwa Damon, Khattala acknowledged being at the Benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement.

Benghazi has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the Obama administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election.

The investigation is led by agents from the FBI in New York and has included some members of the Washington field office, who have traveled to Libya to interview hundreds of witnesses, those briefed on the investigation said.

Khattala told CNN that he had not been questioned by either Libyan authorities or the FBI.

U.S. law enforcement officials said it's not unusual for the FBI not to seek to interview defendants in a case while they collect other evidence.

The Benghazi attack involved scores of militants using rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.

Stevens took refuge behind a fortified door with heavy metal bars to keep the attackers from breaking in. But they set fire to the mission -- a villa -- with diesel fuel. Stevens was overcome by smoke.

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that he would not describe the investigation as proceeding rapidly.

But protesters at the larger camp around the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in the northeastern suburb of Nasr City were still battling mid-morning — under siege by far greater numbers of police.

Egypt’s interim government issued a statement expressing sorrow over the bloodshed. Speaking on state-run TV, a spokesman said the government blamed the Muslim Brotherhood “for any blood spilled” and urged protesters to refrain from using violence, the BBC reported.

Authorities will not stand for any attempts to attack state buildings and police stations in the wake of the long-anticipated crackdown, the spokesman warned.

Officials have long warned that they would move to break up the protest camps, and protesters have been bracing for the assault. The Times reported that some were throwing Molotov cocktails and broken paving stones, while military snipers targeted protesters.

There were widely varying reports about casualties. Western reporters at several morgues and hospitals saw dozens of dead protesters with gunshot wounds to the head and chest — indications that authorities were shooting to kill.

Muslim Brotherhood leaders said hundreds had been killed by indiscriminate fire from soldiers and police; the authorities said about a dozen were dead, including two police officers.

Wednesday’s events seemed likely to widen division between supporters of the Brotherhood and secularists and religious minorities who largely supported the military’s July 3 ouster of the Brotherhood-supported Mr. Morsi, following mass protests against his rule.

The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a human rights groups, said the crackdown already had spurred attacks by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in southern Egypt, The Times reported.

Anti-aircraft weapons were considered less likely , and Rhodes made clear Friday that Obama has ruled out sending any U.S. troops to Syria .
`` The one option that we 've basically taken off the table is boots on the ground , '' Rhodes said , adding that Obama has made the final decision on the step that `` dramatically increases assistance to '' rebel forces .
Presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the United States had shown Russian officials data and information on Syria 's use of chemical weapons , Russia 's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday .
`` What we saw does not look convincing to us , '' Ushakov was quoted as saying .
In a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said arming the rebels `` would lead to an escalation in the region , since the U.S. accusations that Damascus has used chemical weapons are not rooted in reliable facts , '' according to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry .
Washington and Moscow have been deeply divided over how to end the bloodshed in Syria , and the issue is expected to top the agenda when Obama and Putin meet for one-on-on talks Monday at the start of G8 summit in the UK .
`` This is a fluid situation . So it is necessary for us to consult with leaders of the G8 about the types of support that we are providing for the opposition , '' Rhodes said .
Asked about Russia 's questioning of U.S. evidence that Syria forces used chemical weapons multiple times , killing between 100 to 150 people , Rhodes said the information provided to Putin 's government included samples of sarin gas and other `` convincing '' evidence .
That evidence , according to Rhodes , includes intelligence reports , eyewitness accounts and `` physiological samples '' of the nerve agent sarin .
No single piece of intelligence led to the conclusion that the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons , said a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . The official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter .
The finding , according to the official , was a result of looking at a number of instances of suspected use , seeing similar evidence and patterns of usage and coming to the conclusion chemical weapons had been used .
Rhodes acknowledged the differences that remain between the United States and Russia on the Syrian crisis .
The administration believes al-Assad 's forces have used saran gas at least eight times in the more than two year conflict , said a U.S. Senate sourced briefed on the matter .
A boost in support by the United States for the rebels could put at risk the gains made by Syrian forces in recent days , especially in central and northern Syria , with the help of Hezbollah fighters from Iran .
In Damascus , an al-Assad loyalist who spoke to CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen said he believes the United States is `` inventing stories '' about the government 's use of chemical weapons `` because our army is winning . ''
The White House announcement comes at a critical time for the Syrian opposition , which has suffered a series of significant losses in recent weeks . Those losses have coincided in large part with the arrival of thousands of Hezbollah Shiite fighters , backed by Lebanon and Iran , to reinforce al-Assad 's forces battling the mainly Sunni uprising .
After months of gaining ground , the rebels this month lost Qusayr -- one of their strongholds near the Lebanese border -- which was considered essential for the rebels ' supply route .
Until now , the United States has limited its aid to rebels , providing communications equipment , medical supplies and food . Obama signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid in April . That assistance was expected to include body armor , night-vision goggles and other military equipment .
Sen. John McCain , who has repeatedly pushed the Obama administration to step up its support for the rebels , told CNN on Friday that they need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons .
Asked whether the rebels were losing the fight , the Arizona Republican said : `` Absolutely , there 's no doubt about it . ''
He also called for taking out al-Assad 's air assets to create a safe zone for the Syrian opposition .
`` I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly ' zone , to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are , and establish a 'no-fly ' zone with Patriot missiles , '' McCain said .
`` And if we ca n't do that , then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer -- to the Pentagon , 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we ca n't even take care of this situation ? ' '' McCain said .
Rhodes , however , indicated that a `` no-fly '' zone was unlikely , saying it would be `` dramatically more difficult and dangerous and costly '' to enforce one in Syria compared to the one NATO forces imposed with U.S. backing during Libya 's civil war .
Libyan rebels had control of large portions of the country , unlike the Syrian rebels , he noted , and the Libyan military had fewer air-defense systems . He added that a `` no-fly '' zone `` is not a silver bullet . ''
U.S. defense officials are not reviewing any new or updated options for a no-fly zone , two Pentagon sources said .
Even if U.S. planes monitored a no-fly zone along the Syrian-Jordanian border , the Syrian regime could attack targets in southern Syria using long range artillery or Scud missiles , a senior Pentagon official said .
Syria has long maintained that rebels , not government forces , are behind the use of chemical weapons . It also went to the United Nations with its claims , but al-Assad would not allow U.N. inspectors into the country to try to verify the claims .
Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world . Specifically , the supply is believed to include sarin , mustard and VX gases , which are banned under international law . Syria has denied the allegation .
Sarin gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless , odorless and tasteless . It can cause severe injuries -- including blurred vision , convulsions , paralysis and death -- to those exposed to it
In recent months , reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories , possibly because of deteriorating security in the country , raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad 's government fall .
U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Syria 's chemical weapons stockpiles and are certain they remain in the control of al-Assad 's regime , Rhodes said , adding that it would be too dangerous to destroy the chemical weapons stockpiles from afar .
As recently as last week , the French foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the Syrian civil war , citing results from test samples in France 's possession .
In early May , the head of the U.N . Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that evidence points to the use of sarin by Syrian rebel forces . But the commission later issued a news release saying it `` has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict .

""I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles,"" McCain said.

""And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer -- to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'"" McCain said.

Rhodes, however, indicated that a ""no-fly"" zone was unlikely, saying it would be ""dramatically more difficult and dangerous and costly"" to enforce one in Syria compared to the one NATO forces imposed with U.S. backing during Libya's civil war.

Libyan rebels had control of large portions of the country, unlike the Syrian rebels, he noted, and the Libyan military had fewer air-defense systems. He added that a ""no-fly"" zone ""is not a silver bullet.""

U.S. defense officials are not reviewing any new or updated options for a no-fly zone, two Pentagon sources said.

Even if U.S. planes monitored a no-fly zone along the Syrian-Jordanian border, the Syrian regime could attack targets in southern Syria using long range artillery or Scud missiles, a senior Pentagon official said.

Syria's stockpile

Syria has long maintained that rebels, not government forces, are behind the use of chemical weapons. It also went to the United Nations with its claims, but al-Assad would not allow U.N. inspectors into the country to try to verify the claims.

Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation.

Sarin gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It can cause severe injuries -- including blurred vision, convulsions, paralysis and death -- to those exposed to it

In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories, possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall.

U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and are certain they remain in the control of al-Assad's regime, Rhodes said, adding that it would be too dangerous to destroy the chemical weapons stockpiles from afar.

As recently as last week, the French foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the Syrian civil war, citing results from test samples in France's possession.

In early May, the head of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that evidence points to the use of sarin by Syrian rebel forces. But the commission later issued a news release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict.""",www.cnn.com,left,ST8IX8Xx7jlHainr

Syria agreed last year to turn over its chemical weapons to the United Nations

Russia says Syria is preparing a new timetable

Syria missed another deadline Wednesday for destroying its chemical weapons amid a British report that Bashar Assad's regime is stockpiling the weaponry for use in case the country is partitioned.

Syria agreed last year to turn over its chemical weapons to the United Nations as Western powers were threatening to attack the country for using the weapons on neighborhoods where rebels against his regime were hiding out.

Hundreds of women and children died in the attacks in what President Obama called a ""red line"" that would force him to consider military action. But Obama backed down after Russia offered to broker a deal with its ally Assad and get him to agree to relinquish his chemical weapons stockpiles.

Under a timetable set up by the U.N. Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Syria was to have given up its entire stockpile of chemical weapons by Wednesday.

Syria has delivered only a small fraction of the most dangerous components of its chemical weapons — sarin, mustard and VX gases — all of which were supposed to be handed over by Dec. 31, according to OPCW.

Delivery of all the less-dangerous industrial chemical components was supposed to be completed by Wednesday.

""They're not going to make that timeline either,"" said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the U.N. organization, which is overseeing the dismantling of Syria's illicit weapons program. The mission, which started off strong last fall, ""has reached a kind of a stasis at the moment.""

To date, only 4% of Syria's chemical weapons components have been delivered to the port of Latakia to be loaded onto ships and transported for destruction abroad.

Russia said Tuesday that Syria is preparing a new schedule and will make further shipments soon. Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mikdad said Syria is still cooperating.

However, analysts and a British publication say Syria is hiding much of its stockpile from the U.N.

Hallow,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a leading neoconservative hawk and staunch supporter of Israel , says the U.S. military interventions he has long supported to promote democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere have backfired and need to be re-evaluated .
“ I am a neoconservative . But at some point , even if you are a neoconservative , you need to take a deep breath to ask if our strategies in the Middle East have succeeded , ” the 2012 Republican presidential hopeful said in an interview .
Mr. Gingrich supported the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , but he said he has increasingly doubted the strategy of attempting to export democracy by force to countries where the religion and culture are not hospitable to Western values .
“ It may be that our capacity to export democracy is a lot more limited than we thought , ” he said .
Mr. Gingrich at times has expressed doubts about the U.S. capacity for nation-building , but he said he now has formed his own conclusions about their failures in light of the experiences of the past decade .
“ My worry about all this is not new , ” Mr. Gingrich said . “ But my willingness to reach a conclusion is new . ”
Mr. Gingrich said it is time for Republicans to heed some of the anti-interventionist ideas offered by the libertarian-minded Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , and Sen. Ted Cruz , a Texas Republican , tea party favorite and foreign policy skeptic .
“ I think it would be healthy to go back and war-game what alternative strategies would have been better , and I like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul because they are talking about this , ” Mr. Gingrich said .
Mr. Paul , a longtime critic of neoconservatives on foreign policy , argues that war must be a last resort and never should be used for nation-building .
In a June 24 column in The ███ , Mr. Paul wrote that Americans were told for many years that the radical Taliban would return to power quickly unless U.S. forces remained in Afghanistan .
“ Well , guess what , after 12 years , trillions of dollars , more than 2,200 Americans killed , and perhaps more than 50,000 dead Afghan civilians and fighters , the Taliban is coming back anyway ! ” Mr. Paul wrote .
He noted a similar pattern of radical resurgence in Iraq after American forces withdrew .
As far back as December 2003 , Mr. Gingrich was questioning the follow-up for the successful U.S. invasion .
“ I am very proud of what [ Operation Iraqi Freedom commander Gen. ] Tommy Franks did — up to the moment of deciding how to transfer power to the Iraqis . Then we go off a cliff , ” he told Newsweek magazine . He said the point should have been “ not ‘ How many enemy do I kill ? ’ , [ but ] ‘ How many allies do I grow ? ’ ”
He also noted his past wariness about U.S. military interventions , often telling audiences that “ we could directly guarantee democracy in Iraq and not stay a day longer than needed in Korea. ” “ Korea has been a 63-year engagement , ” he added with a laugh .
Mr. Gingrich argued less than two years ago that President Obama should have “ quietly tried to push ” Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak out of office .
But he now questions whether even U.S. indirect intervention in Egypt to back the overthrow of the longtime Egyptian leader and U.S. ally might have been a mistake . “ Here ’ s a simple question : ‘ Is Egypt really better off than going back to Mubarak since it ’ s hard to argue that the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s dictatorship is better than Mubarak ? ’ ” Mr. Gingrich said .
The former speaker added that U.S. military action in Syria would risk a repeat of interventionist foreign policy mistakes .
“ I explicitly would not go into Syria , ” he said . “ I would look at the whole question of how we think of the governments in other countries , ” he said .
He said the result may be another military dictatorship in Egypt and that would be better than rule by the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood .
“ It ’ s hard to argue the chaos in Syria , Iraq , Libya and Lebanon make for a better future , ” Mr. Gingrich said .
The fear of many in the United States and Israel is that the Arab Spring is bringing not Western-style democracy but simply replacing secular authoritarians with militantly Islamic religious governments that are hostile to Israel and the U.S. , he said .
“ I certainly would have allied myself in the 1970s and 1980s with the strategy of intervention and defeating the Soviet Union , but there is definitely a reflection point for conservatives and Republican Party leaders on how we have approached our major national security questions , ” Mr. Gingrich said . “ I am not alone in asking the question : ‘ Are we making progress after the Arab Spring ? ’ ”
A top official in the George W. Bush administration , which oversaw the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns and occupations , offered partial agreement with Mr. Gingrich .
“ People want to know if Gingrich has really changed his opinion — his point of view — because if he has it will make an impact , ” said former Bush political director Matt Schlapp .
“ There are plenty of conservatives and Republicans who think that those decisions to go into Afghanistan and Iraq were overly aggressive , ” said Mr. Schlapp . “ But I believe the vast majority of Republicans are hoping these life-and-death decisions we made in Afghanistan and Iraq were the right decisions to combat terrorism . ”
Mr. Gingrich said the U.S. “ should begin to focus narrowly on American interests ” rather than on attempting to change systems of governance abroad to our liking .
“ I think we really need a discussion on what is an effective policy against radical Islam , since it ’ s hard to argue that our policies of the last 12 years have effective , ” he said .
Mr. Gingrich repeated comments he expressed in an interview on Laura Ingraham ’ s radio show supporting Mr. Paul in his extended contretemps with New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , a fellow Republican . Mr. Christie sharply criticized what he called the “ esoteric , intellectual debates ” he said Mr. Paul and his allies were staging in the face of the need for stronger security polices in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks .
“ I consistently have been on the side of having the courage that Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have , and I think it ’ s sad to watch the establishment grow hysterical , but , frankly , they ’ re hysterical because they have no answers , ” Mr. Gingrich said on “ The Laura Ingraham Show . ”
Mr. Gingrich predicted that Mr. Christie ’ s attack was the “ first sign ” of more to come from the party ’ s foreign policy establishment .
“ The establishment will grow more and more hysterical the more powerful Rand Paul and Ted Cruz become , ” Mr. Gingrich said . “ They will gain strength as it ’ s obvious that they are among the few people willing to raise the right questions . ”","Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a leading neoconservative hawk and staunch supporter of Israel, says the U.S. military interventions he has long supported to promote democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere have backfired and need to be re-evaluated.

A top official in the George W. Bush administration, which oversaw the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns and occupations, offered partial agreement with Mr. Gingrich.

“People want to know if Gingrich has really changed his opinion — his point of view — because if he has it will make an impact,” said former Bush political director Matt Schlapp.

“There are plenty of conservatives and Republicans who think that those decisions to go into Afghanistan and Iraq were overly aggressive,” said Mr. Schlapp. “But I believe the vast majority of Republicans are hoping these life-and-death decisions we made in Afghanistan and Iraq were the right decisions to combat terrorism.”

Mr. Gingrich said the U.S. “should begin to focus narrowly on American interests” rather than on attempting to change systems of governance abroad to our liking.

“I think we really need a discussion on what is an effective policy against radical Islam, since it’s hard to argue that our policies of the last 12 years have effective,” he said.

Mr. Gingrich repeated comments he expressed in an interview on Laura Ingraham’s radio show supporting Mr. Paul in his extended contretemps with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fellow Republican. Mr. Christie sharply criticized what he called the “esoteric, intellectual debates” he said Mr. Paul and his allies were staging in the face of the need for stronger security polices in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.

“I consistently have been on the side of having the courage that Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have, and I think it’s sad to watch the establishment grow hysterical, but, frankly, they’re hysterical because they have no answers,” Mr. Gingrich said on “The Laura Ingraham Show.”

Mr. Gingrich predicted that Mr. Christie’s attack was the “first sign” of more to come from the party’s foreign policy establishment.

“The establishment will grow more and more hysterical the more powerful Rand Paul and Ted Cruz become,” Mr. Gingrich said. “They will gain strength as it’s obvious that they are among the few people willing to raise the right questions.”

Last week, the Israelis needed the backing of the United States more than ever, and yet, for the first time in decades, they couldn’t rely on it. It’s shameful that the Obama administration fell for the Big Lie and rewarded Palestinian hatred. But, sadly, it’s not surprising.

Officials in Washington said the United States did not take part in arms shipments to the rebels , though they recognized that Syria ’ s neighbors would do so , and that it was important to ensure that weapons did not end up in the hands of Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups .
The increased ferocity of the attacks and the more lethal weapons on both sides threatened to overwhelm diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis . Kofi Annan , the special envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League , continued to pressure Damascus to halt the violence and to respect a cease-fire . But Mrs. Clinton said that if Mr. Assad did not stop the violence by mid-July , the United Nations would have little choice but to end its observer mission in the country .
Mrs. Clinton , State Department officials said , continues to push for a “ managed transition , ” under which Mr. Assad would step aside . Russia ’ s role is viewed as critical , however , and Mrs. Clinton ’ s claims about helicopter shipments are certain to increase tensions with Moscow less than a week before President Obama is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit meeting in Mexico .
Administration officials declined to give details about the helicopters , saying the information was classified . But Pentagon sources suggested that Mrs. Clinton , in her remarks at a Brookings Institution event , was referring to a Russian-made attack helicopter that Syria already owns but has not yet deployed to crack down on opposition forces . While these helicopters , known as Mi-24s , are flown by Syrian pilots , Russia supplies spare parts and provides maintenance for them .
A Pentagon spokesman , Capt . John Kirby , said the precise status of the helicopters was not as important as the violence being directed against opponents of the Syrian government . “ The focus really needs to be more on what the Assad regime is doing to its own people than the cabinets and the closets to which they turn to pull stuff out. ” Captain Kirby said . “ It ’ s really about what they ’ re doing with what they ’ ve got in their hand . ”
The use of helicopters is contributing to a growing sense that , as Hervé Ladsous , the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations , put it , the fighting could be characterized as a civil war .
“ The government of Syria lost some large chunks of territories and several cities to the opposition and wants to retake control of these areas , ” Mr. Ladsous said at the United Nations . “ So now we have confirmed reports not only of the use of tanks and artillery , but also attack helicopters . ”
Opposition leaders are wary of the term civil war because it suggests that the conflict is somehow an even match .
“ Civil war will not come suddenly in one day or two or five , but you have to look how things are gradually changing on the ground , ” said Samir Nachar , a member of the executive committee of the Syrian National Council . “ Can you say to people , ‘ Don ’ t defend yourselves ? ’ It is impossible . ”
Council members on Tuesday were also wary of reading too much into Mrs. Clinton ’ s claim , suggesting that it was an open secret for months that the Russians were supplying weapons to Syria . There have been repeated reports of Russian armament ships docking in Syria , although Moscow has always denied that they were carrying the arms used to suppress the protests .
Speaking in Istanbul , council members also described efforts to supply the opposition with arms , specifically antitank weaponry delivered by Turkish Army vehicles to the Syrian border , where it was then transferred to smugglers who took it into Syria .
Turkey has repeatedly denied that it is giving anything other than humanitarian aid to the opposition , mostly at refugee camps near the border . It has recently made those camps harder to visit : permission was not granted to two reporters in the vicinity for five days last week . Turkey did not act alone , but with financial support from Qatar and Saudi Arabia and after consultation with the United States , said these officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the subject ’ s diplomatic delicacy .
The more powerful weapons have been delivered as far south as the suburbs of Damascus , but not into Damascus itself , they said . The presence of the antitank missiles seems to have made government forces hesitant to move their tanks around urban centers , according to sources in the Syrian National Council .
But they have done nothing to stem the violence . On Tuesday , a team of United Nations cease-fire monitors retreated before reaching Al Heffa in the northwest , when hostile crowds struck their vehicles with stones and metal rods , said a spokeswoman , Sausan Ghosheh .
“ The shelling has been continuous , ” said Houran al-Hafawi , a member of the local coordination committee of Al Heffa . “ The Syrian Army is throwing missiles and rockets from helicopter and rocket launchers from the eastern and western entrances . ”
For the Pentagon , the debate over Russia ’ s rearming of Syria took an odd twist on Tuesday when Senator John Cornyn , a Texas Republican , complained that the United States military was buying attack helicopters for Afghan security forces from the same Russian weapons company supplying the Assad government .
George Little , the Pentagon press secretary , defended the purchases of the Mi-17 helicopters from the Russian company , Rosoboronexport , as important to helping Afghanistan create a credible self-defense force , and said the issue was separate from the concern over arms shipments to Syria that were used by the government to kill civilians .

middle_east,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/21/white-house-un-must-review-chemical-weapons-syria/,Syria again challenges Obama’s ‘red line’ on chemical weapons,2013-08-21,Stephen Dinan,"President Obama ’ s “ red line ” for Syria is once again being tested after rebel forces said Wednesday that the regime of President Bashar Assad used poison gas to attack civilians near Damascus , killing potentially hundreds in what could turn out to be the deadliest deployment of chemical weapons yet .
Adding to the pressure on the White House were videos supplied by rebels showing victims convulsing and choking , and powerful photos of children wrapped in clean white shrouds , lined shoulder to shoulder with their dead faces visible .
The Syrian regime adamantly denied that it used chemical weapons .
The White House said it was trying to confirm the reports independently but that the allegations pose a test for the embattled Mr. Assad , who has said he wants to disprove allegations of chemical weapons attacks . Mr. Assad now will have to decide whether he will allow a 20-member team of United Nations chemical weapons inspectors who just arrived in his country to examine the new sites .
“ It ’ s time for them to live up to that claim , ” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters . “ And if they actually are interested in getting to the bottom of the use of chemical weapons and whether or not that ’ s occurred in Syria , then they will allow the U.N. investigative team that ’ s already in Syria to access the site where chemical weapons may have been used . ”
Rebels gave various estimates of the death toll from the artillery fire , ranging from the low hundreds to more than 1,300 .
SEE ALSO : French foreign minister calls for ‘ force ’ in Syria if poison gas used
In New York , the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session to call for a “ thorough , impartial and prompt investigation ” of the charges against Syria .
Argentina ’ s U.N. ambassador , Maria Cristina Perceval , the current council president , told reporters that there was “ strong concern ” about the latest charges of chemical weapons use “ and a general sense that there must be clarity on what happened. ” Russia and China approved the move but blocked a proposal by the United States and its allies to issue a stronger statement on the incident .
News organizations said it was impossible to verify either the death toll reports or the nature of the attack .
The reports emerged almost a year to the day after Mr. Obama issued his “ red line ” to the Syrian regime , saying he would ensure that Damascus would suffer “ enormous consequences ” if chemical weapons were used or even if they were being readied for deployment .
Pressed by reporters about what consequences could be in line and why the U.S. response has been limited to condemnation , Mr . Earnest demurred . Still , he acknowledged the administration has “ not attained our goal here yet , which is the removal of Assad from power . ”
That is partly because the U.S. remains limited in the steps it ’ s ready to take .
Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , wrote a letter this week to a congressman saying the Pentagon is opposed to even limited action in Syria backing the rebels because it is not certain it would be aiding those who support American interests .
“ Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides , ” Gen. Dempsey said in the Aug. 19 letter to Rep. Eliot L. Engel , New York Democrat .
In the letter , which was obtained by The Associated Press , Gen. Dempsey said , “ It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor . Today , they are not . ”
The general said that establishing a no-fly zone over Syria , as some lawmakers have called for , would dent the regime ’ s air power but would not be a decisive blow leading to Mr. Assad ’ s ouster and instead would draw the U.S. deeper into the conflict .
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said some sort of intervention is needed to stop the civil war , which has raged since 2011 and has killed more than 100,0000 , according to U.N. estimates .

Adding to the pressure on the White House were videos supplied by rebels showing victims convulsing and choking, and powerful photos of children wrapped in clean white shrouds, lined shoulder to shoulder with their dead faces visible.

The Syrian regime adamantly denied that it used chemical weapons.

The White House said it was trying to confirm the reports independently but that the allegations pose a test for the embattled Mr. Assad, who has said he wants to disprove allegations of chemical weapons attacks. Mr. Assad now will have to decide whether he will allow a 20-member team of United Nations chemical weapons inspectors who just arrived in his country to examine the new sites.

“It’s time for them to live up to that claim,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. “And if they actually are interested in getting to the bottom of the use of chemical weapons and whether or not that’s occurred in Syria, then they will allow the U.N. investigative team that’s already in Syria to access the site where chemical weapons may have been used.”

Rebels gave various estimates of the death toll from the artillery fire, ranging from the low hundreds to more than 1,300.

In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session to call for a “thorough, impartial and prompt investigation” of the charges against Syria.

Argentina’s U.N. ambassador, Maria Cristina Perceval, the current council president, told reporters that there was “strong concern” about the latest charges of chemical weapons use “and a general sense that there must be clarity on what happened.” Russia and China approved the move but blocked a proposal by the United States and its allies to issue a stronger statement on the incident.

News organizations said it was impossible to verify either the death toll reports or the nature of the attack.

The reports emerged almost a year to the day after Mr. Obama issued his “red line” to the Syrian regime, saying he would ensure that Damascus would suffer “enormous consequences” if chemical weapons were used or even if they were being readied for deployment.

Pressed by reporters about what consequences could be in line and why the U.S. response has been limited to condemnation, Mr. Earnest demurred. Still, he acknowledged the administration has “not attained our goal here yet, which is the removal of Assad from power.”

That is partly because the U.S. remains limited in the steps it’s ready to take.

Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote a letter this week to a congressman saying the Pentagon is opposed to even limited action in Syria backing the rebels because it is not certain it would be aiding those who support American interests.

“Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,” Gen. Dempsey said in the Aug. 19 letter to Rep. Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat.

In the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Gen. Dempsey said, “It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.”

The general said that establishing a no-fly zone over Syria, as some lawmakers have called for, would dent the regime’s air power but would not be a decisive blow leading to Mr. Assad’s ouster and instead would draw the U.S. deeper into the conflict.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said some sort of intervention is needed to stop the civil war, which has raged since 2011 and has killed more than 100,0000, according to U.N. estimates.

“The U.S. has two options: continue to largely stand on the sidelines as the regime slaughters its own people, or tip the balance of power against a brutal dictator by degrading its ability to attack civilians,” Mr. Engel said in a statement. “If we are to salvage what remains of our credibility in the region, we must act soon.”

middle_east,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/2/8337347/iran-deal-good,This is an astonishingly good Iran deal,2015-04-02,"Max Fisher, Alissa Wilkinson, Ian Millhiser, Jason Del Rey, Zack Beauchamp, Hannah Brown, Jen Kirby","When Aaron Stein was studying nuclear nonproliferation at Middlebury College 's Monterey graduate program , the students would sometimes construct what they thought would be the best possible nuclear inspection and monitoring regimes .
Years later , Stein is now a Middle East and nuclear proliferation expert with the Royal United Services Institute ( as well as the Geneva Centre for Security Policy and the Atlantic Council ) . And in April , he told me that the Iran nuclear deal , the broad strokes of which had just been announced , looks an awful lot like those ideal hypotheticals he 'd put together in grad school .
`` When I was doing my nonproliferation training at Monterey , this is the type of inspection regime that we would dream up in our heads , '' he said at the time . `` We would hope that this would be the way to actually verify all enrichment programs , but thought that would never be feasible . ''
Stein concluded it would make `` an excellent deal '' — if the negotiators could turn those broad strokes into a formal , finalized agreement . This week , they did exactly that .
The full , final Iran nuclear deal `` exceeds in all areas , '' Stein said on Tuesday . `` It makes the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote . ''
Like many observers , I doubted in recent months that Iran and world powers would ever reach this stage ; the setbacks and delays had simply been too many . Now here we are , and the terms are astoundingly favorable to the United States . Arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts are heralding it as a huge success .
Iran is giving up the bulk of its nuclear program
The deal requires Iran to surrender some crucial components of its nuclear program , in part or even in whole . Here are the highlights :
Iran will give up about 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges .
Iran will give up all but its most rudimentary , outdated centrifuges : Its first-generation IR-1s , knockoffs of 1970s European models , are all it gets to keep . It will not be allowed to build or develop newer models .
Iran will give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium ; it will hold on to only 300 kilograms of its 10,000-kilogram stockpile in its current form .
Iran will destroy or export the core of its plutonium plant at Arak , and replace it with a new core that can not produce weapons-grade plutonium . It will ship out all spent nuclear fuel .
Iran would simply not have much of its nuclear program left after all this .
A shorthand people sometimes use to evaluate the size of Iran 's nuclear program is its `` breakout time . '' If Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei woke up tomorrow morning and decided to set his entire nuclear program toward building a nuclear warhead — to `` break out '' to a bomb — as of today it would take him two or three months . Under the terms of the deal , his program would be so much smaller that it would take him an entire year to build a single nuclear warhead .
`` I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities . That 's amazing . ''
These terms are not abject surrender . Iran is allowed to keep a small nuclear program , and it won some concessions of its own . For example , what little uranium enrichment is allowed will be done at Iran 's facility at Natanz — a hardened , reinforced-concrete structure that was once used for covert enrichment and that the US had hoped to close .
Iran will also be allowed to do some research at Fordow , another hardened facility the US had wanted to close , though the research is restricted and will be barred from using fissile material . These are not big concessions , and they matter mostly for their symbolic value , but it 's something .
Still , when you look at many of the specifics laid out in the deal , the hard numbers and timetables and the detailed proscriptions , those all tend to be quite favorable to the United States .
The result is pretty clear , Stein said : `` The intention of this agreement is to take the weapons option off the table for the next 25 years , and the agreement does that . ''
The deal is strong on many terms , but it strongest on what was always going to be among the most crucial : inspections .
Whatever number of centrifuges Iran has or does n't have , whatever amount of uranium it 's allowed to keep or forced to give up , none of it matters unless inspectors have enough authority to hold Tehran to its end of the deal — and to convince the Iranians that they could never get away with cheating . To say the US got favorable terms here would be quite an understatement ; the Iranians , when it comes to inspections , practically gave away the farm .
`` I would give it an A , '' Stein said , in April , of the framework . When I asked why : `` Because of the inspections and transparency . ''
There are two reasons inspections are so important . The first is that super-stringent inspections are a deterrent : If the Iranians know that any deviation is going to be quickly caught , they have much less incentive to try to cheat , and much more incentive to uphold their side of the deal .
The second is that if Iran were to try a build a nuclear weapon now , it likely would n't use the material that 's already known to the world and being monitored . Rather , the Iranians would secretly manufacture some off-the-books centrifuges , secretly mine some off-the-books uranium , and squirrel it all away to a new , secret underground facility somewhere . That would be the only way for Iran to build up enough of an arsenal such that by the time the world found out , it would be too late to do anything about it .
Really robust inspections would be the best way stop that from happening . They would prevent Iran from sneaking off centrifuges or siphoning away uranium that could be used to build an off-the-grid nuclear weapons program , without the world finding out .
Under this deal , the inspections are so strong , Stein said , that if Iran tried to cheat on the deal , `` the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent . ''
The inspections issue has not gotten much political attention . When I spoke to Jeffrey Lewis , the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at Middlebury 's Monterey Institute of International Studies , back in March before the framework was announced , he seemed worried that negotiators would not focus on it much . Rather , overwhelming political focus in Washington and Tehran on issues like Iran 's number of allowed centrifuges seemed likely to push inspections from the top priorities .
Lewis suggested that a top item on his wish list would be inspections so robust that inspectors do n't just get to visit enrichment sites like Natanz and Fordow , but also centrifuge factories . That , he said , `` would be a big achievement . ''
Sure enough , Lewis got his wish and then some : centrifuge factory inspections is one of the terms in the framework , and it 's pretty robust . For the next 20 years , inspectors would have `` continuous surveillance at Iran 's centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities . ''
That 's part of why , when I asked Lewis to grade the final deal this week , he gave me the same answer that Stein had : `` I would give it an A . ''
`` I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities . That 's amazing , '' Stein said in April , when the first terms came out . That provision is now part of the final deal .
It 's not just centrifuge factories . Inspectors will have access to all parts of Iran 's nuclear supply chain , including its uranium mines and the mills where it processes uranium ore . Inspectors will also not just monitor but be required to pre-approve all sales to Iran of nuclear-related equipment . This provision also applies to something called `` dual-use '' materials , which means any equipment that could be used toward a nuclear program .
`` The inspections and transparency on the rotors , and the bellows , and the uranium mines is more than I ever thought would be in this agreement , '' Stein added .
How the deal prevents Iran from going nuclear for the next 25 years
When I talked to Stein this week , we discussed the scenario that this deal is all about : What happens if Iran decides it wants to build a nuclear bomb ? I asked him to walk me through how that would happen , and how effective this deal would be at stopping it .
`` They would do Fordow 2.0 , '' he said , referring to the underground Fordow facility where Iran had previously conducted secret and illegal nuclear development . In other words , they would build another underground bunker and do it there . Iran is a big country , and even very strong inspections ca n't spot every hole in the ground . But they would need two things for this , and both in large supply : uranium ore and centrifuges . This is where the deal comes in .
First , Stein explained , `` They would siphon off uranium from an undeclared mine . '' But under the deal , `` that 's not really possible . ''
`` Iran only has two mines , '' he said — both of which will be under heavy inspections and monitoring . `` It does not have rich uranium deposits , despite its claims to the contrary . We should know — we helped develop those fields in the 1970s .
`` If all of a sudden a barrel of uranium at a conversion facility does n't show up , we 'd know , '' he explained . `` They [ inspectors ] have an accounting of what comes out of the ground ; they have an accounting of what has been refined at the processing plant . They have an accounting of what 's been converted , then they have an accounting of what shows up at Natanz , and then they have an accounting of what comes out the back end . ''
But for the sake of seeing through the hypothetical , let 's say that somehow , magically , Iran is able to sneak away the large amounts of uranium ore necessary for a bomb . Then what ?
`` Then they would build centrifuges without us knowing , because a centrifuge facility is tiny , '' Stein said . `` You do n't really pick them up ; we 've never really been able to find them when they are up . ''
The deal addresses this , as well : Not only will inspectors keep tabs on every single centrifuge in the country , but they will have eyes on the centrifuge factories , on machines that could be used to make a centrifuge , even on imports of technology that could be used to build a machine that could be used to build a centrifuge .
`` In the agreement , they have to account for all of their flow forming machines [ that can be used to build a centrifuge ] , give us a list of where they are , and then put them under monitoring , '' Stein said . `` The counter to that is they just wo n't tell us , they wo n't declare everything . That 's to be expected , so do n't trust that . '' That 's where the deal 's monitoring of things like `` dual use '' technology , that can have non-nuclear as well as nuclear uses , comes into play .
Meanwhile , Iran will have a relatively small program of approved centrifuges and energy-grade uranium . But all of this will be under constant monitoring , making it essentially impossible for Iran to use them for anything nefarious without the world knowing pretty quickly .
But let 's keep the hypothetical going . Let 's say that Iran breaks the restrictions on centrifuges or uranium and that the inspectors or US intelligence , inevitably , find out . What happens then ?
What happens is that international sanctions — the sanctions that so hurt Iran 's economy that it came limping up to the negotiating table — come back . This was always going to be a very difficult part of the deal ; the sanctions are so powerful because they come from the European Union and from the United Nations , backed even by China and Russia , all of whom are more skittish than the US about punishing Iran . So how do you make sure they 'll go along with reimposing sanctions ? How do you make that threat so severe and so certain that Iran wo n't dare test it ?
The solution they came up with is an elaborate mechanism they 're calling `` snapback . ''
`` The snapback thing is really clever , I had to read it a couple of times to make sure it said what I think it said , '' Jeffrey Lewis , the Middlebury nuclear expert , told me .
If the US thinks Iran is cheating , the first step is taking it to a special commission of the seven countries that signed the deal plus the European Union . `` But wait , '' you 're saying , `` ca n't Russia or China just use this process to stall or outright block the US ? '' Nope , they ca n't , because if the US is still unhappy , after a few weeks it can kick the issue up to the UN Security Council .
`` But wait , '' you say again , `` wo n't Russia and China just veto anything the US brings up there ? '' Nope , they ca n't meddle there either . If the US complains to the Security Council , and after 30 days the Security Council does nothing — and the US can ensure it does nothing by vetoing any resolutions — then under the deal the sanctions will automatically come back into force .
`` It sounds like the US can blow up the deal any time it wants and revert to sanctions , '' Lewis said . And there 's a good reason for that : `` That 's just how things are anyway . ''
But say all of that happens — say that Iran cheats on the deal , we inevitable catch them , all the sanctions come back , and somehow Iran keeps chugging away anyway on illegal nuclear development . This seems unlikely — if this is Iran 's plan , they just signed a deal making it far more difficult to do it — but it 's worth imagining . What then ?
`` The military force issue would come back , '' Stein said . In other words , it would take us back where we were a few years ago , with the US threatening military action against Iran . It is worth again recalling that that ended with Iran agreeing to nuclear negotiations in which it willingly gave up the bulk of its nuclear program , so it seems to want to avoid this scenario .
But if this worst-case scenario should happen , then the deal is still a net positive for the US . `` I think the US hand is actually strengthened in this , to be honest with you , '' Stein said . `` A full accounting of where everything is [ gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring ] is a wonderful targeting mechanism for the Pentagon . ''
The terms in the agreement are just about the best that we could hope for — even better , in some ways , than many had thought possible . The concessions from Iran are painful and many ; the concessions by the US minor and few ; the details surprisingly robust .
`` As a framework it 's very good , '' Mark Fitzpatrick , the director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , tweeted in April when the broad terms were revealed . He added , `` A sharp critic of Iran and skeptic of the talks told me after the announcement that it seemed to be heavily tilted in favour of the West . ''
The Arms Control Association issued a statement saying that the `` historic '' agreement `` promises to lead to one of the most consequential and far-reaching nuclear nonproliferation achievements in recent decades . ''
Daryl Kimball , the Arms Control Association 's chief , told the Guardian , `` The deal is a major nuclear nonproliferation breakthrough that promises to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed state and head off a nuclear arms race in the world 's most volatile region . ''
Andrea Berger of the Royal United Services Institute called it `` an incredible achievement that much of the nuclear community will enthusiastically support . '' And on and on .
The way that all of this works is quite technical . But once you understand things like enrichment and inspections regimes and sanctions snapback , you see that the deal is actually pretty simple . Lewis put it well when we spoke :
I see it as a really straightforward measure to slow down an enrichment program that was going gangbusters . So you ask , `` Does it slow it down ? '' Yes . `` Does it slow it down in a way that is verifiable ? '' Yes . `` Does it slow it down more than bombing it would ? '' Yes . `` Okay , good deal . ''","When Aaron Stein was studying nuclear nonproliferation at Middlebury College's Monterey graduate program, the students would sometimes construct what they thought would be the best possible nuclear inspection and monitoring regimes.

A shorthand people sometimes use to evaluate the size of Iran's nuclear program is its ""breakout time."" If Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei woke up tomorrow morning and decided to set his entire nuclear program toward building a nuclear warhead — to ""break out"" to a bomb — as of today it would take him two or three months. Under the terms of the deal, his program would be so much smaller that it would take him an entire year to build a single nuclear warhead.

""I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities. That's amazing.""

These terms are not abject surrender. Iran is allowed to keep a small nuclear program, and it won some concessions of its own. For example, what little uranium enrichment is allowed will be done at Iran's facility at Natanz — a hardened, reinforced-concrete structure that was once used for covert enrichment and that the US had hoped to close.

Iran will also be allowed to do some research at Fordow, another hardened facility the US had wanted to close, though the research is restricted and will be barred from using fissile material. These are not big concessions, and they matter mostly for their symbolic value, but it's something.

Still, when you look at many of the specifics laid out in the deal, the hard numbers and timetables and the detailed proscriptions, those all tend to be quite favorable to the United States.

The result is pretty clear, Stein said: ""The intention of this agreement is to take the weapons option off the table for the next 25 years, and the agreement does that.""

The core issue that the deal really nails

The deal is strong on many terms, but it strongest on what was always going to be among the most crucial: inspections.

Whatever number of centrifuges Iran has or doesn't have, whatever amount of uranium it's allowed to keep or forced to give up, none of it matters unless inspectors have enough authority to hold Tehran to its end of the deal — and to convince the Iranians that they could never get away with cheating. To say the US got favorable terms here would be quite an understatement; the Iranians, when it comes to inspections, practically gave away the farm.

""I would give it an A,"" Stein said, in April, of the framework. When I asked why: ""Because of the inspections and transparency.""

There are two reasons inspections are so important. The first is that super-stringent inspections are a deterrent: If the Iranians know that any deviation is going to be quickly caught, they have much less incentive to try to cheat, and much more incentive to uphold their side of the deal.

""I would give it an A""

The second is that if Iran were to try a build a nuclear weapon now, it likely wouldn't use the material that's already known to the world and being monitored. Rather, the Iranians would secretly manufacture some off-the-books centrifuges, secretly mine some off-the-books uranium, and squirrel it all away to a new, secret underground facility somewhere. That would be the only way for Iran to build up enough of an arsenal such that by the time the world found out, it would be too late to do anything about it.

Really robust inspections would be the best way stop that from happening. They would prevent Iran from sneaking off centrifuges or siphoning away uranium that could be used to build an off-the-grid nuclear weapons program, without the world finding out.

Under this deal, the inspections are so strong, Stein said, that if Iran tried to cheat on the deal, ""the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent.""

The inspections issue has not gotten much political attention. When I spoke to Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at Middlebury's Monterey Institute of International Studies, back in March before the framework was announced, he seemed worried that negotiators would not focus on it much. Rather, overwhelming political focus in Washington and Tehran on issues like Iran's number of allowed centrifuges seemed likely to push inspections from the top priorities.

Lewis suggested that a top item on his wish list would be inspections so robust that inspectors don't just get to visit enrichment sites like Natanz and Fordow, but also centrifuge factories. That, he said, ""would be a big achievement.""

Sure enough, Lewis got his wish and then some: centrifuge factory inspections is one of the terms in the framework, and it's pretty robust. For the next 20 years, inspectors would have ""continuous surveillance at Iran's centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities.""

That's part of why, when I asked Lewis to grade the final deal this week, he gave me the same answer that Stein had: ""I would give it an A.""

""I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities. That's amazing,"" Stein said in April, when the first terms came out. That provision is now part of the final deal.

It's not just centrifuge factories. Inspectors will have access to all parts of Iran's nuclear supply chain, including its uranium mines and the mills where it processes uranium ore. Inspectors will also not just monitor but be required to pre-approve all sales to Iran of nuclear-related equipment. This provision also applies to something called ""dual-use"" materials, which means any equipment that could be used toward a nuclear program.

""The inspections and transparency on the rotors, and the bellows, and the uranium mines is more than I ever thought would be in this agreement,"" Stein added.

How the deal prevents Iran from going nuclear for the next 25 years

When I talked to Stein this week, we discussed the scenario that this deal is all about: What happens if Iran decides it wants to build a nuclear bomb? I asked him to walk me through how that would happen, and how effective this deal would be at stopping it.

""They would do Fordow 2.0,"" he said, referring to the underground Fordow facility where Iran had previously conducted secret and illegal nuclear development. In other words, they would build another underground bunker and do it there. Iran is a big country, and even very strong inspections can't spot every hole in the ground. But they would need two things for this, and both in large supply: uranium ore and centrifuges. This is where the deal comes in.

First, Stein explained, ""They would siphon off uranium from an undeclared mine."" But under the deal, ""that's not really possible.""

""Iran only has two mines,"" he said — both of which will be under heavy inspections and monitoring. ""It does not have rich uranium deposits, despite its claims to the contrary. We should know — we helped develop those fields in the 1970s.

""If all of a sudden a barrel of uranium at a conversion facility doesn't show up, we'd know,"" he explained. ""They [inspectors] have an accounting of what comes out of the ground; they have an accounting of what has been refined at the processing plant. They have an accounting of what's been converted, then they have an accounting of what shows up at Natanz, and then they have an accounting of what comes out the back end.""

But for the sake of seeing through the hypothetical, let's say that somehow, magically, Iran is able to sneak away the large amounts of uranium ore necessary for a bomb. Then what?

""Then they would build centrifuges without us knowing, because a centrifuge facility is tiny,"" Stein said. ""You don't really pick them up; we've never really been able to find them when they are up.""

The deal addresses this, as well: Not only will inspectors keep tabs on every single centrifuge in the country, but they will have eyes on the centrifuge factories, on machines that could be used to make a centrifuge, even on imports of technology that could be used to build a machine that could be used to build a centrifuge.

""The snapback thing is really clever""

""In the agreement, they have to account for all of their flow forming machines [that can be used to build a centrifuge], give us a list of where they are, and then put them under monitoring,"" Stein said. ""The counter to that is they just won't tell us, they won't declare everything. That's to be expected, so don't trust that."" That's where the deal's monitoring of things like ""dual use"" technology, that can have non-nuclear as well as nuclear uses, comes into play.

Meanwhile, Iran will have a relatively small program of approved centrifuges and energy-grade uranium. But all of this will be under constant monitoring, making it essentially impossible for Iran to use them for anything nefarious without the world knowing pretty quickly.

But let's keep the hypothetical going. Let's say that Iran breaks the restrictions on centrifuges or uranium and that the inspectors or US intelligence, inevitably, find out. What happens then?

What happens is that international sanctions — the sanctions that so hurt Iran's economy that it came limping up to the negotiating table — come back. This was always going to be a very difficult part of the deal; the sanctions are so powerful because they come from the European Union and from the United Nations, backed even by China and Russia, all of whom are more skittish than the US about punishing Iran. So how do you make sure they'll go along with reimposing sanctions? How do you make that threat so severe and so certain that Iran won't dare test it?

The solution they came up with is an elaborate mechanism they're calling ""snapback.""

""The snapback thing is really clever, I had to read it a couple of times to make sure it said what I think it said,"" Jeffrey Lewis, the Middlebury nuclear expert, told me.

If the US thinks Iran is cheating, the first step is taking it to a special commission of the seven countries that signed the deal plus the European Union. ""But wait,"" you're saying, ""can't Russia or China just use this process to stall or outright block the US?"" Nope, they can't, because if the US is still unhappy, after a few weeks it can kick the issue up to the UN Security Council.

""But wait,"" you say again, ""won't Russia and China just veto anything the US brings up there?"" Nope, they can't meddle there either. If the US complains to the Security Council, and after 30 days the Security Council does nothing — and the US can ensure it does nothing by vetoing any resolutions — then under the deal the sanctions will automatically come back into force.

""It sounds like the US can blow up the deal any time it wants and revert to sanctions,"" Lewis said. And there's a good reason for that: ""That's just how things are anyway.""

But say all of that happens — say that Iran cheats on the deal, we inevitable catch them, all the sanctions come back, and somehow Iran keeps chugging away anyway on illegal nuclear development. This seems unlikely — if this is Iran's plan, they just signed a deal making it far more difficult to do it — but it's worth imagining. What then?

""The military force issue would come back,"" Stein said. In other words, it would take us back where we were a few years ago, with the US threatening military action against Iran. It is worth again recalling that that ended with Iran agreeing to nuclear negotiations in which it willingly gave up the bulk of its nuclear program, so it seems to want to avoid this scenario.

But if this worst-case scenario should happen, then the deal is still a net positive for the US. ""I think the US hand is actually strengthened in this, to be honest with you,"" Stein said. ""A full accounting of where everything is [gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring] is a wonderful targeting mechanism for the Pentagon.""

This is about the best we could ask for

The terms in the agreement are just about the best that we could hope for — even better, in some ways, than many had thought possible. The concessions from Iran are painful and many; the concessions by the US minor and few; the details surprisingly robust.

""As a framework it's very good,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, the director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, tweeted in April when the broad terms were revealed. He added, ""A sharp critic of Iran and skeptic of the talks told me after the announcement that it seemed to be heavily tilted in favour of the West.""

The Arms Control Association issued a statement saying that the ""historic"" agreement ""promises to lead to one of the most consequential and far-reaching nuclear nonproliferation achievements in recent decades.""

Daryl Kimball, the Arms Control Association's chief, told the Guardian, ""The deal is a major nuclear nonproliferation breakthrough that promises to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed state and head off a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region.""

Andrea Berger of the Royal United Services Institute called it ""an incredible achievement that much of the nuclear community will enthusiastically support."" And on and on.

The way that all of this works is quite technical. But once you understand things like enrichment and inspections regimes and sanctions snapback, you see that the deal is actually pretty simple. Lewis put it well when we spoke:

I see it as a really straightforward measure to slow down an enrichment program that was going gangbusters. So you ask, ""Does it slow it down?"" Yes. ""Does it slow it down in a way that is verifiable?"" Yes. ""Does it slow it down more than bombing it would?"" Yes. ""Okay, good deal.""

The speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday marked Mr. Netanyahu 's latest public challenge to President Barack Obama to more aggressively confront Tehran .

Nuclear experts believe Iran would need 250 kilograms of uranium enriched to 20 % to make one crude bomb . Iran would need to reprocess the fuel to 90 % purity to have the fissile material for a nuclear bomb .
U.S. officials believe that any effort by Tehran to begin producing the most highly enriched uranium would be detected by IAEA monitors based at Iran 's nuclear facilities in the cities of Natanz and Qom .
Mr. Netanyahu , however , stressed Thursday that he did n't believe Western intelligence was good enough to run the risk of allowing Iran to push forward with its enrichment efforts . Israel is also concerned that Iran is moving more fuel production to an underground facility seen as impervious to attack .

Egypt is one of two Arab countries that has made peace with Israel
The U.S. also has interests with the Suez Canal and American companies in Egypt
When Egypt 's first democratically elected president was tossed out this year , the White House stopped short of calling it a coup .
Doing so would have forced an end to the $ 1.23 billion that the United States sends in military aid a year -- and changed the course of its relationship with its strongest Arab ally in the region .
But that was before Wednesday , when the military-led interim government stormed two camps full of former President Mohamed Morsy 's supporters . More than 525 people were killed and 3,717 wounded in the bloodiest day in Egypt 's recent history , officials there said .
On Thursday , President Barack Obama condemned the violence against civilians and announced the United States is canceling next month 's joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises .
But will the carnage in Egypt spur more changes in U.S. policy toward the most populous Arab country ? And might the hardening U.S. stance affect Egypt 's own approach ?

The United States helps Egypt in part because it 's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel .
In return , Egypt gets more than $ 1 billion each year in U.S. taxpayer money for military and civilian programs . No other country except Israel gets more .
That aid buys Washington an ally to depend on in a turbulent region .
The U.S. does n't want to upset that balance . And pulling aid might do so .
`` It 's a hornets ' nest . And that 's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much , '' CNN 's Fareed Zakaria said .
But it 's not just the peace process and regional stability that the United States is interested in .
Egypt controls the Suez Canal , a crucial sea route used by more than 4 % of the world 's oil traffic and 8 % of all seaborne trade . So far , the canal is running smoothly . But a disruption there could end up hitting Americans in the pocketbook , not to mention affect the safe passage of U.S. military ships and equipment .
Then there 's business for American companies , intelligence cooperation -- and the military relationship .
`` The reality is that the Egyptian military has not only been a source of stability for the United States in an otherwise turbulent Middle East , but it has also been a cash cow , '' said Khairi Abaza , a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies .

`` Currently , the Egyptian military relies on U.S. military equipment , training and services . This reliance means that Egypt is essentially a client of the U.S. military complex , and aid money is in fact re-injected back into the U.S . economy . ''
All of the factors are enough to give the U.S. pause .
`` If you want a different relationship , you have to articulate what that looks like , and accept you are going to have to give up some things to get other things . ''
From the Obama administration 's side , it 's an `` incredibly complex and difficult situation '' that will require more time to figure out .
That 's what White House spokesman Jay Carney said in July soon after Morsy was ousted , and reporters pressed him as to why the administration was n't calling it a coup .
`` It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs '' to Egypt , Carney said at the time .
Middle East analyst Robin Wright with the Wilson Center says the core issue is what our policy ought to be .
`` The United States faces a really tough dilemma now , '' she said . `` What to do about the most important country in the Arab world , the cornerstone of the peace process , a country that has received over $ 30 billion in U.S. aid since the peace process began in the late 1970s . ''
Some in Congress , including Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , already have called for halting the aid , saying the United States `` should not be supporting this coup . '' McCain traveled to Egypt on August 5 along with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina . Both held meetings with representatives of the interim government and the Muslim Brotherhood .
Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , has said the United States has n't committed much of this year 's aid -- and that 's a good thing .
`` This is an opportunity to have a pause and say to the Egyptians , 'You have an opportunity to come together , ' `` he said . `` You have to have the military understand that that 's what we 're looking for , a transition right away , as soon as possible . ''
According to senior U.S. officials last month , the administration is examining three potential options :
-- Call it a coup and issue a national security waiver to allow aid to continue .
-- Do n't call it a coup because the Egyptian military has taken steps to move the country toward a civilian transitional government and subsequent elections .

''","Story highlights The U.S. gives Egypt about $1.23 billion in military aid a year

Egypt is one of two Arab countries that has made peace with Israel

The U.S. also has interests with the Suez Canal and American companies in Egypt

President Obama has canceled joint military exercises with Egypt

When Egypt's first democratically elected president was tossed out this year, the White House stopped short of calling it a coup.

Doing so would have forced an end to the $1.23 billion that the United States sends in military aid a year -- and changed the course of its relationship with its strongest Arab ally in the region.

But that was before Wednesday, when the military-led interim government stormed two camps full of former President Mohamed Morsy's supporters. More than 525 people were killed and 3,717 wounded in the bloodiest day in Egypt's recent history, officials there said.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama condemned the violence against civilians and announced the United States is canceling next month's joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises.

But will the carnage in Egypt spur more changes in U.S. policy toward the most populous Arab country? And might the hardening U.S. stance affect Egypt's own approach?

JUST WATCHED Why hasn't the U.S. cut aid to Egypt? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why hasn't the U.S. cut aid to Egypt? 04:11

The short answer: We'll have to wait and see.

'A hornets' nest'

The United States helps Egypt in part because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel.

In return, Egypt gets more than $1 billion each year in U.S. taxpayer money for military and civilian programs. No other country except Israel gets more.

That aid buys Washington an ally to depend on in a turbulent region.

The U.S. doesn't want to upset that balance. And pulling aid might do so.

""It's a hornets' nest. And that's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said.

Give up some to get some

But it's not just the peace process and regional stability that the United States is interested in.

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route used by more than 4% of the world's oil traffic and 8% of all seaborne trade. So far, the canal is running smoothly. But a disruption there could end up hitting Americans in the pocketbook, not to mention affect the safe passage of U.S. military ships and equipment.

Then there's business for American companies, intelligence cooperation -- and the military relationship.

""The reality is that the Egyptian military has not only been a source of stability for the United States in an otherwise turbulent Middle East, but it has also been a cash cow,"" said Khairi Abaza, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

""Currently, the Egyptian military relies on U.S. military equipment, training and services. This reliance means that Egypt is essentially a client of the U.S. military complex, and aid money is in fact re-injected back into the U.S. economy.""

All of the factors are enough to give the U.S. pause.

""If you want a different relationship, you have to articulate what that looks like, and accept you are going to have to give up some things to get other things.""

'A really tough dilemma'

From the Obama administration's side, it's an ""incredibly complex and difficult situation"" that will require more time to figure out.

That's what White House spokesman Jay Carney said in July soon after Morsy was ousted, and reporters pressed him as to why the administration wasn't calling it a coup.

""It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs"" to Egypt, Carney said at the time.

Middle East analyst Robin Wright with the Wilson Center says the core issue is what our policy ought to be.

""The United States faces a really tough dilemma now,"" she said. ""What to do about the most important country in the Arab world, the cornerstone of the peace process, a country that has received over $30 billion in U.S. aid since the peace process began in the late 1970s.""

Calls mounting

Some in Congress, including Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, already have called for halting the aid, saying the United States ""should not be supporting this coup."" McCain traveled to Egypt on August 5 along with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Both held meetings with representatives of the interim government and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said the United States hasn't committed much of this year's aid -- and that's a good thing.

""This is an opportunity to have a pause and say to the Egyptians, 'You have an opportunity to come together,' "" he said. ""You have to have the military understand that that's what we're looking for, a transition right away, as soon as possible.""

Three choices

According to senior U.S. officials last month, the administration is examining three potential options:

-- Call it a coup and cut off aid.

-- Call it a coup and issue a national security waiver to allow aid to continue.

-- Don't call it a coup because the Egyptian military has taken steps to move the country toward a civilian transitional government and subsequent elections.

Now, officials -- both current and former -- recognize the climate is not encouraging.

'Time to call it a coup'

""I think it is time to call it a coup. I think it was time six weeks ago,"" former Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Wednesday.

""Suspend military assistance so the military is invested in the process of rewriting the constitution, setting the parliament and electing a new president.""

Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that while a political solution is still possible, ""it has been made much, much harder, much more complicated.""

""The path toward violence leads only to greater instability, economic disaster and suffering,"" Kerry said

He also called for an end to Egypt's new state of emergency, which prevents freedom of peaceful assembly and due process.

U.S. still considering its strategy

But as far as firm actions, the United States' game plan has yet to be drawn.

The Pentagon is mulling whether to halt or delay arms exports.

But as leaders in Washington mull their options, Americans overwhelmingly support staying out of the unrest, according to a recent United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll.

Almost eight in 10 Americans (78%) said the United States should ""mostly stay out of events"" in Egypt, according to the poll. But 16% said the U.S. should ""do more"" to end the violence.

The desire to stay out of Egypt's affairs might be connected to the fact that a majority of Americans feel what happens in the country isn't very important to U.S. interests.

According to a Pew Research Center poll, 61% of Americans say what happens in Egypt is somewhat important or not important, while 36% say it is very important.

But ultimately, it's up to Egyptians to find a peaceful resolution between the military-backed interim government and those who want Morsy back.

This deal is designed to buy time and build trust for a grander , permanent agreement . Given Iran ’ s past perfidy in similar talks , Israel and other skeptics are right to worry that Iran will not comply this time . They also believe Iran is merely maneuvering for time in case a war-weary US lessens its role in the Middle East .
But President Obama and other Western leaders are also right to test Iran ’ s motives under a well-constructed agreement . Their approach is far better than the stark alternative of a war provoked by an Israeli or US-Israeli attack on Iran ’ s nuclear facilities .
Iran has far more to prove than simply reveal a peaceful nuclear intent . Its continuing actions in Syria , Iraq , Gaza , Lebanon , and elsewhere suggest a lingering revolutionary fervor to advance its influence by military means and to brandish its Shiite brand of Islam over rival Sunnis , especially in Saudi Arabia .
At the same time , Iran is struggling under tougher sanctions and is more aware of its growing isolation . Its revolution has not gone beyond its borders . Its young people remain restless after a 2009 popular revolt against a rigged election ; they are inspired by the spirit of the 2011 Arab Spring and dispirited by high unemployment .
Last June ’ s surprise election of a new president , Hassan Rouhani , may have added to a possible shift in motives by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his closest confidants . The ruling clerics may be worried enough now about their survival that they are willing to give up dangerous foreign adventurism .

For the next six months, its compliance in allowing intrusive inspections, in suspending its enhanced enrichment of uranium, and in not making the Arak plutonium reactor operational, will begin to reveal whether the 1979 Iranian Revolution may be coming to an end.

This deal is designed to buy time and build trust for a grander, permanent agreement. Given Iran’s past perfidy in similar talks, Israel and other skeptics are right to worry that Iran will not comply this time. They also believe Iran is merely maneuvering for time in case a war-weary US lessens its role in the Middle East.

But President Obama and other Western leaders are also right to test Iran’s motives under a well-constructed agreement. Their approach is far better than the stark alternative of a war provoked by an Israeli or US-Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Iran has far more to prove than simply reveal a peaceful nuclear intent. Its continuing actions in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere suggest a lingering revolutionary fervor to advance its influence by military means and to brandish its Shiite brand of Islam over rival Sunnis, especially in Saudi Arabia.

At the same time, Iran is struggling under tougher sanctions and is more aware of its growing isolation. Its revolution has not gone beyond its borders. Its young people remain restless after a 2009 popular revolt against a rigged election; they are inspired by the spirit of the 2011 Arab Spring and dispirited by high unemployment.

Last June’s surprise election of a new president, Hassan Rouhani, may have added to a possible shift in motives by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his closest confidants. The ruling clerics may be worried enough now about their survival that they are willing to give up dangerous foreign adventurism.

Yet motives on both sides are not only personal but national. In both Tehran and Washington, various leaders will debate the merits and potential pitfalls of this temporary agreement, or the one that might come after it.

In a mid-November poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans support a nuclear deal with Iran. That indicates a popular will for peace that is reflected by reports within Iran. Each nation is coming to terms with each other after decades of estrangement, marked by occasional violence.

For now, however, actions speak louder than words and this temporary agreement is designed to evoke verifiable action by each side. Once initial trust is gained, the deal can allow a deeper search for motives. An openness in revealing intent is half way to achieving a peaceful outcome.",www.csmonitor.com,center,lYEgo1osQPh6RexS

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey — As the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobani rages, Turkish Kurds are growing increasingly angry at the military's lack of action there.

Protests erupted across Turkey this week, leaving at least 31 dead, including three police officers, and scores injured. At least 10 of the dead were killed in the city of Diyarbakir alone, according to Turkish media. Yet even as the violence seems to have waned temporarily, tensions remain and many fear protests will erupt again.

""If Kobani falls, and I don't want to say this, but there will be a domino effect,"" said Fatma Sik Barut, the co-mayor of the Sur municipality within the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. ""There is the very distinct possibility of an urban war (in Turkey).""

The boiling anger and resentment is deeply ingrained in the relationship between Turkey and the Kurds in the country's south. What is largely considered the earliest Kurdish nationalist revolt occurred in 1925 when a cleric named Said led a short-lived uprising to re-establish an Islamic caliphate in Turkey. The rebellion ended with his hanging two months later.

The Turkish government brutally cracked down on the rebellion's following, sending many Kurdish families who supported the rebellion scurrying across the border into northern Syria.

""Many of the Sheikh Said families went to Kobani,"" Barut said, tying the fight for the town against Islamic State forces not just to a political but also a personal history for many of Turkey's Kurds.

""It looks like there is a war against all the things the Kurds have gotten,"" Barut said about the battle for Kobani. ""The Kurds think they are really alone.""



Even with all that history churning the waters, the Kobani situation is just the latest in a long string of Kurdish grievances.

Many Kurds in Southern Turkey remain angry with the Turkish government's long-standing and rather unfriendly stance toward Syria's Kurdish rebels, the Popular Protection Units (YPG), which has been among the most successful forces fighting the Islamic State in Syria.

Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the YPG's parent organization, a guerrilla group known as the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), is no different from the Islamic State itself.

That remark took many Kurds aback, especially considering Erdogan began a peace process with the PKK early last year. As part of the agreement, the PKK, which had been at war with the Turkish government for several decades, withdrew to Iraq in exchange for a series of concessions. Since then, the Kurds see the Turks as having failed to live up to their end of the bargain.

Seemingly in response to Erdogan's remarks the PKK's jailed leader, Abdullah ""Apo"" Ocalan, gave the Turkish government an Oct. 15 deadline to fulfill their end of the bargain. But if Kobani falls, ""it will be the end of the (peace) process,"" Ocalan said in a statement earlier this week.

Meanwhile, on the ground, the state of Turkish-Kurdish relations is much more visceral.

Neslihan Coban, 63, lost her son Mazlum, 23, on Wednesday, the second day of protests. She arrived at the hospital to find her son lying dead, his stomach slashed by a long knife, she says.

According to an eyewitness who met Neslihan at the hospital, Mazlum had been driving his car in a ""noise protest,"" where drivers honked their horns to bring attention to the demonstration. Someone pulled him out of the car, says Neslihan, and stabbed him. According to doctors he bled out by the time he arrived at the hospital.

Neslihan specifically blames the Huda Party, a Kurdish Islamist Party that many say is aligned with the Islamic State, but she also blames the Turkish government for letting this kind of thing happen.

""Turkey is a terrorist country,"" she says, ""I will never forgive any of them, for they are the murderers of my son.""

Despite her loss, Neslihan says she still supports the protests and makes clear that things will continue to get worse if the Turkish government does nothing in Kobani.

""If it continues there will be an urban war here,"" she says, eerily using the same language as Barut.

The administration ’ s inconsistencies go beyond its false assertion for days afterward that a made-in-America anti-Muslim video spurred “ spontaneous ” Sept. 11 assaults in which U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens , his information officer and two former Navy SEALs were killed .
The House and Senate intelligence committees are scheduled Thursday to hold closed-door hearings on the Benghazi attack – grilling top CIA , FBI and State Department officials – amid Republican charges of a pre-election White House cover-up . Former CIA Director David H. Petraeus also will testify before Congress about the Benghazi attack , appearing before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in a closed-door hearing Friday . A Senate hearing is also likely , though details remained uncertain Wednesday night .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is visiting Australia and will not testify this week .
• The level of security at the consulate provided by the State Department .
• Officials ’ statements about a Benghazi protest that did not occur .
• The availability of U.S. troops to come to the rescue during the assault .
• The nearly monthlong lag in getting FBI investigators into Benghazi .
Still lingering is the issue of an exact timeline for President Obama on Sept. 11 after the White House received a State Department email about 4 p.m. ( 10 p.m. Libya time ) stating that the consulate was under attack . The White House has not said what he was told by his advisers and what orders , if any , he issued during the eight-hour onslaught .
“ If you look at the timeline , in retrospect , it ’ s obvious they were lying through their teeth , ” said Ken Allard , a retired Army colonel and national security columnist . “ It seemed like the truth was being pulled out of them , piece by piece . It reminds me of Watergate . The constant drip , drip , drip . ”
No larger discrepancy exists than the one surrounding the motive for the attack on the consulate by scores of militants , who used diesel fuel to set fire to its four main buildings .
On Sept. 12 , Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper told the White House that a spontaneous demonstration over the Internet video grew into a violent attack . Two days later , Mr. Petraeus echoed that account in closed-door comments to senators , according to news reports .
At the time , Mr. Petraeus had ended an extramarital affair with his biographer , Paula Broadwell , who was at the center of an FBI investigation over threatening emails to a women she saw as a romantic rival . Conservatives have asked whether the Petraeus scandal prompted the director to toe the administration line . Mr. Petraeus has since resigned .
Senators are expected to ask Mr. Clapper and Mr. Petraeus , who has agreed to testify at another time and place , how they came to their conclusions in the face of facts that did not fit the White House ’ s rush to dismiss Islamic terrorists as the attackers .
The CIA ’ s station chief in Tripoli , Libya , immediately branded the attack as the work of militants .
The Defense Intelligence Agency on Sept. 12 briefed the Pentagon that Ansar al-Shariah , a Libyan group linked to al Qaeda , likely carried out the attack . An email from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli that arrived at the White House about 5 p.m. said Ansar al-Shariah had claimed responsibility .
Over the next two days , Libyan security officials told the Western press that the attack was planned to coincide with the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States .
In Washington , Patrick F. Kennedy , the State Department undersecretary in charge of diplomatic security , told congressional staffers on Sept. 12 that the assault bore all the hallmarks of a well-orchestrated terrorist operation .
Despite the mounting evidence , Mr. Clapper and other Obama officials stuck to the video-made-them-do-it pronouncement , although the president made vague references to terrorism on two occasions .
Perhaps the height of the disconnect occurred Sept. 19 , when Matthew G. Olsen , director of the National Counterterrorism Center , became the first administration official to testify in public about the attack .
“ They were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy , ” he told the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee .
That same day at the White House , press secretary Jay Carney told reporters : “ Right now , I ’ m saying we don ’ t have evidence at this point that this was premeditated or preplanned to coincide to happen on a specific date or coincide with that anniversary . ”
A senior intelligence official told The ███ that Mr. Clapper abandoned the video argument five to six days after the attack and had informed the White House .
But Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , told reporters that Mr. Clapper stuck to that opinion for 10 days .
There is also conflict over a reported demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi .
The most conspicuous official to back that version is Susan E. Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , who made the Sunday talk-show rounds on Sept. 16 to drive home the point that Libyan demonstrators incensed over the video had turned violent .
“ The information , the best information and the best assessment we have today , is that in fact this was not a preplanned , premeditated attack , ” Mrs. Rice said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ What happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video .
“ People gathered outside the embassy , and then it grew very violent , and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons , which unfortunately are quite common in postrevolutionary Libya , and that then spun out of control . But we don ’ t see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan , premeditated attack , ” she said .
That may have been consistent with Mr. Clapper ’ s briefing , but not with a lot of other evidence , including Western press interviews with eyewitnesses who said there were no protesters .
Two weeks later , a State Department official held a conference call with reporters and disowned the public remarks of one of its own . The official said the State Department never concluded that an anti-Muslim video provoked the attack .
What ’ s more , the official acknowledged that there had never been a demonstration , spontaneous or otherwise . Security cameras showed no activity outside the consulate walls . Then , at 9:40 p.m. Libya time , streams of armed men began an assault .
Their onrush raised another key question . Why did mission security seem so thin ? There were a handful of Libyan private security guards outside the wall . Three members of a friendly militia resided in a barracks inside . Mr. Stevens had five American security guards ; ultimately , they were no match for the invaders . Some reports said a Libyan guard joined the attackers .
Two days later at the State Department ’ s press briefing with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland , a reporter asserted that “ very few ” security personnel were there .
“ I ’ m going to reject that , ” Mrs. Nuland said . “ Let me tell you what I can about the security at our mission in Benghazi . It did include a local Libyan guard force around the outer perimeter . This is the way we work in all of our missions all around the world , that the outer perimeter is the responsibility of the host government .
“ There was obviously a physical perimeter barrier , a wall . And then there was a robust American security presence inside the compound , ” she said . “ This is absolutely consistent with what we have done at a number of missions similar to Benghazi around the world . ”
It may have been consistent with missions around the world , but in this case the consulate sat in a city that was becoming home to an increasing number of Islamic militants .
Whistleblowers inside the State Department began leaking internal memos that found their way to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , and told a story that differed from the official line .
Personnel on scene told Washington that security was inadequate . Lt. Col. Andrew Wood , an Army Green Beret who headed three site-security teams , said he repeatedly asked to keep them in Libya , but was rebuffed by State Department officials .
“ The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there , ” testified Col. Wood , whose last men were pulled out a month before the attack . “ The situation remained uncertain , and reports from some Libyans indicated it was getting worse . Diplomatic security remained weak . ”
Eric Nordstrom , the top diplomatic security officer in Libya that summer , recalled asking his supervisor for 12 officers for Benghazi . He was rebuffed .
In the phone conservation with a superior in Washington , he said , “ It ’ s dealing and fighting against the people , programs and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me . And I added [ to ] it by saying , for me , the Taliban is on the inside of the building . ”
The administration also asserted it had no intelligence that foretold the attack . That may be true , if intelligence means an intercepted phone call or human source .
But if the mounting number of attacks on Western targets before Sept. 11 was deemed as a sign , then the attack on the consulate was predictable .
Militants repeatedly attacked the International Red Cross building . Terrorists planted a bomb at the U.S. Consulate that blew a hole in one wall . Islamists ambushed the British ambassador ’ s convoy , prompting London to pull all its diplomats out of Benghazi .
“ When that occurred , it was apparent to me that we were the last flag flying in Benghazi , ” Col. Wood testified . “ We were the last thing on their target list to remove from Benghazi . ”
There also were conflicting statements from the Pentagon on why U.S. forces never showed up in Benghazi , especially during the long siege on the CIA annex , where the two former SEALs were killed by mortar fire early Sept. 12 .
At first , Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said no forces were used because he did not have a good picture of conditions on the ground .
He said Sept. 27 that he operated under a “ basic principle is that you don ’ t deploy forces into harm ’ s way without knowing what ’ s going on , without having some real-time information about what ’ s taking place . And , as a result of not having that kind of information , the commander who was on the ground in that area and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation . ”
But it turns out there were no forces , based on a Pentagon timeline released last week .
Mr. Panetta ordered two special-operations units , one in the U.S. , one in Croatia , to position themselves in Sicily , across the Mediterranean from Benghazi . He did not give the order until two to four hours after the attack had begun . The troops did not arrive in Sicily until the night of Sept. 12 , more than 12 hours after the last Americans had left the mission and flown to Tripoli .
The ███ has reported that U.S. Africa Command , which has military jurisdiction over North Africa , has no quick- reaction force . One is being set up , but is not ready .
Also late in arriving was the FBI . Headquarters in Washington said agents did not show up in Benghazi until Oct. 4 because of security concerns .
But up to that time , Western reporters had rummaged through the charred remains of the consulate unimpeded and found sensitive documents , including Mr. Stevens ‘ diary . CNN reported that the journal showed the ambassador worried about the rise of violence and Islamic extremism in Benghazi and feared he was on an al Qaeda hit list .
“ The timelines put out by the administration make no sense , and it ’ s extremely curious the administration made little effort to get the FBI into Benghazi in a timely manner to conduct the investigation , ” said Larry Johnson , a former CIA officer . “ That investigation would have been critical to identifying the people who carried out the attack . ”
This week , Rep. Frank R. Wolf , Virginia Republican , upped the ante by urging House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , to assemble a special bipartisan committee to investigate .
“ Too many questions remain surrounding the Benghazi attack and response , and the questions seem to grow by the day , ” Mr. Wolf said in a letter .","The Obama administration’s public versions of events in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya have been riddled with discrepancies, starting soon after the American dead and survivors left behind a charred diplomatic compound and bullet-scarred CIA building in Benghazi.

‘This is the way we work’

There is also conflict over a reported demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.

The most conspicuous official to back that version is Susan E. Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who made the Sunday talk-show rounds on Sept. 16 to drive home the point that Libyan demonstrators incensed over the video had turned violent.

CNN reported that the journal showed the ambassador worried about the rise of violence and Islamic extremism in Benghazi and feared he was on an al Qaeda hit list.

“The timelines put out by the administration make no sense, and it’s extremely curious the administration made little effort to get the FBI into Benghazi in a timely manner to conduct the investigation,” said Larry Johnson, a former CIA officer. “That investigation would have been critical to identifying the people who carried out the attack.”

This week, Rep. Frank R. Wolf, Virginia Republican, upped the ante by urging House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, to assemble a special bipartisan committee to investigate.

“Too many questions remain surrounding the Benghazi attack and response, and the questions seem to grow by the day,” Mr. Wolf said in a letter.

Washington (CNN) – President Obama on Thursday sharply criticized the Egyptian military's deadly crackdown. In doing so, he also acknowledged an administration bet gone bad.

No, the administration still won't use the term ""coup"" to describe the forced ouster of Egypt's democratically elected government. But, in the president's words, ""the United States strongly condemns"" the action of an interim government it was counting on to take a measured path after seizing power.



""Instead we've seen a more dangerous path taken through arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsy's associates and supporters and now, tragically, violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more,"" the president said Thursday morning during a break from his August vacation.

A day earlier, it was Secretary of State John Kerry delivering the criticism of the military-led interim government. To the tough rhetoric the president added this: a decision to cancel planned joint military exercises next month.

A review of public statements shows that officials in the Obama administration last year thought Mr. Assad ’ s brutal tactics , such as an all-out assault on the city of Aleppo , would cause him to face internal opposition and lose power to the hodgepodge of Islamic and secular insurgents fighting his regime .
“ I think if they continue this kind of tragic attack on their own people in Aleppo , I think it ultimately will be a nail in Assad ’ s own coffin , ” Leon E. Panetta said in July as defense secretary . “ He ’ s just assuring that the Assad regime will come to an end by virtue of the kind of violence that they ’ re permitting against their own people .
“ I think it ’ s pretty clear that what Assad has been doing to his own people , and what he continues to do to his own people , makes clear that his regime is coming to an end . ”
Ten months later , Mr. Assad not only remains in power but also has solidified support from Iran , which has organized militias to augment Syria ’ s armed forces . There also is evidence that Mr. Assad authorized the use of chemical weapons , a “ red line ” that the Obama administration warned a year ago the Syrian regime should not cross or else face consequences .
“ I think everyone is surprised at how resilient the regime has been , ” said James Russell , a former Pentagon official and now an instructor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey , Calif. “ The main thing is that his army has not turned its guns on the regime , and the Mukhabarat state security service has not turned and run when faced with an enemy in the field . The security services have been the Assad family ’ s pillar , and it has proven to be stronger than we thought . ”
The White House is re-examining its entire approach to Syria , with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel saying one option is to arm the rebels directly — a measure President Obama rejected last year .
In February , Mr. Panetta revealed a wide split within the administration . He , along with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , endorsed giving arms to vetted rebels . But the White House vetoed the move .
Meanwhile , a NATO-led air campaign in Libya is credited with tipping the battle in favor of rebels who ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 . Mr. Obama was decidedly cool toward the operation but acceded to the wishes of Britain and France .
Mr. Panetta was not the only Obama official who predicted last year that Mr. Assad would fall . Mrs. Clinton predicted that the Syrian dictator ’ s military would get tired of the killing and bump him from power , as what happened in Tunisia and Egypt .
“ We also know from many sources there are people around Assad now who are beginning to hedge their bets , ” Mrs. Clinton said at a conference in Tunisia in February 2012 . “ They didn ’ t sign up to slaughter people and they are looking for ways out . We saw this happen in other settings in the last years . I think it is going to begin happening in Syria . ”
Five months later , Mrs. Clinton , while in Tokyo , said of the Assad regime : “ The days are numbered . And as we saw with the recent high-level defection , with the increasing numbers of defections , the sand is running out of the hourglass . ”
James Phillips , a Middle East analyst at the Heritage Foundation , called these statements “ wishful thinking . ”
“ I think the Obama administration ’ s Syria policy has been flawed from the beginning by wishful thinking , ” he said . “ It initially saw Assad as a reformer who should be engaged rather than a brutal dictator who relied on terror to maintain control of his own people and exported terrorism to advance Syria ’ s hostile foreign policy . ”
As the conflict erupted in March 2011 and intensified , Mr. Obama and others called on Mr. Assad to leave but put no pressure on him , Mr. Phillips said .
Mr. Obama turned to the United Nations , which gave Russia , a strong Syrian ally , and China the opportunity to veto a get-tough resolution .
“ The lesson is that when an administration leads from behind , U.S. national interests get left behind , ” Mr. Phillips said .
P.J . Crowley , who was Mrs. Clinton ’ s spokesman early in the administration ’ s first term , said he thinks Mrs. Clinton ’ s assessment is correct and that Mr. Assad will fall .
“ It is hard to see how he will be able to die in office , after a long life , as his father did , ” Mr. Crowley said .
The administration has made mistakes , he said , such as comparing the Syrian revolt to the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt .
“ The Syrian security forces made a different choice , remaining devoted as an institution to the Assad family rather than the Syrian people , ” he said . “ There have been many defections and there will be many more . The Syrian military is under enormous pressure and is likely to crack at some point . The military leadership might decide to save itself at Assad ’ s expense , but there is no indication that we are close to that moment . ”
Mr. Crowley also said the administration “ did underestimate Assad ’ s dark side . ”

The new deal on Iran’s nuclear program could bring one of the most sweeping changes in decades to Washington’s strategic calculus — if it holds.

The Pentagon has devoted tens of thousands of troops, billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and a huge amount of brainpower to deterring the Iranian nuclear nightmare that this weekend’s announcement might ultimately forestall.

From aircraft carrier strike groups to massive bunker-busting weapons to the bases of so-called Southwest Asia — a polite fiction the Air Force uses to sidestep acknowledging its troops and warplanes in places such as Qatar and Kuwait — the American military effort to deter Iranian aggression is immense.

So if Iran gives up its ability to obtain nuclear weapons, there’s no telling what ripple effects ultimately could result for the U.S. military and security throughout the Middle East and the world.

In announcing the Geneva agreement late Saturday, President Barack Obama said he believes Washington and the world have the duty to explore those possibilities.

“I have a profound responsibility to try to resolve our differences peacefully rather than rush toward conflict,” he said at the White House. “Today, we have a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive peaceful settlement, and I believe we must test it.”

Even the most optimistic Middle East analyst probably is not cockeyed enough to expect Iran’s nuclear agreement to also mean it will withdraw the many tentacles it uses to work its will in places from Syria to Iraq to the tiny Gulf kingdom of Bahrain. But eliminating the nuclear threat from the geostrategic equation in the neighborhood would reduce the risks to the U.S. and its allies — especially Israel — by many orders of magnitude.

( WATCH: Kerry remarks on Iran nuclear deal)

And there could be political and diplomatic ramifications much farther afield.

For example, a nuclear-free Iran might mean the U.S. and its European allies could scale back or abandon their plans to build an American-backed missile defense shield, designed to protect European capitals from an Iranian attack. American destroyers already patrol the Mediterranean Sea as part of the missile defense effort, and U.S. and Romanian officials broke ground late last month on the Aegis Ashore missile defense complex at Romania’s Deveselu Air Base.

The European missile defense shield has been a major diplomatic problem for the U.S. and Russia, partly because Russian President Vladimir Putin fears it could threaten the country’s strategic arsenal. If the Iranian nuclear threat went away and took with it the dispute over European missile defense, that would be one less problem between Washington and Moscow — although there are many others.

Missile defense advocates in the United States, such as Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who have been pushing for a new East Coast site to defend against a potential Iranian attack, might find that case much tougher to make without a threat from Tehran.

There could be other such second- and third-order effects. Just the same, no one in Washington is daydreaming yet about how to spend any Iranian peace dividend.

The president himself tried to manage expectations in his remarks Saturday night to praise the deal. “It won’t be easy, and huge challenges remain ahead,” he said. And administration officials said they remain clear-eyed about Iran’s record of duplicity.

Conservatives were even more skeptical about the nuclear deal.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — a vocal sanctions hawk who wants to add new restrictions to the defense authorization bill the Senate left in limbo — said Saturday night he thought Iran was getting off easy since it’s keeping its enrichment centrifuges.

The question at the center of eleventh-hour negotiations opening in Geneva on Wednesday is whether Iran and the West can truly see eye to eye on a specific set of rules by which the main U.N. nuclear watchdog — the International Atomic Energy Agency — will be allowed to access nuclear and other sites inside Iran after a deal is signed .

The Obama administration has appeared undeterred . Administration officials have downplayed the Iranian parliament ’ s move and stuck to a rhetorical line laid down last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry that Washington is looking ahead , not at the past .
Although Iran may have spent years hiding its efforts from the IAEA , Mr. Kerry told reporters , the Obama administration is prepared to look beyond such history . “ We ’ re not fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what they did at one point in time or another , ” he said . “ We know what they did . We have no doubt . We have absolute knowledge with respect to the certain military activities they were engaged in . ”
The comments triggered outrage among some analysts , including Mark Dubowitz , executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , who once advised the administration on Iran policy .
“ If you look forward without looking back , then you miss decades of Iranian nuclear mendacity and a well-established record of Iranian cheating and challenging the IAEA , ” Mr. Dubowitz said in an interview . “ I think Secretary Kerry should be more cautious in assuming that the U.S. intelligence community has ‘ absolute knowledge ’ of Iran ’ s nuclear program .
“ The Iranians stonewalled the IAEA for years . They ’ ve been denying inspectors access , and they ’ ve been building illicit nuclear facilities that we ’ ve been unable to detect , ” he said . “ We ’ ve gone through six separate U.N. Security Council resolutions since 2006 , and time and time again , in every report , the IAEA has said it was unable to certify that Iran ’ s nuclear program is peaceful — that there are no undeclared sites or activities and there is no illicit diversion of nuclear material . ”
Indeed , a timeline on the official website of the IAEA outlines a history of back-and-forth between the U.N. nuclear inspectors and Iranian authorities dating back to 2002 .
Although there is sporadic evidence of cooperation from Tehran over the years , the period was highlighted by repeated incidents of frustration by IAEA inspectors , who felt they were either outright blocked or intentionally misled during investigative visits to Iran .
Such frustration reached a critical moment in 2006 , when the U.N. Security Council responding by passing a resolution demanding that “ Iran suspend uranium enrichment by 31 August or face possible economic [ and ] diplomatic sanctions . ”
The Security Council flatly asserted that , despite years of attempts by IAEA inspectors to gain access to sites inside Iran , the agency was “ still unable to provide assurances about Iran ’ s undeclared nuclear material and activities . ”
Even with the resolution in place , Tehran continued to defy the agency , prompting the Security Council to level its first slate of sanctions banning foreign companies from selling nuclear-related materials and technology to Iran and freezing the assets of several officials tied to the nuclear program .
Iranian stonewalling of IAEA inspectors continued into 2007 , prompting an expansion of the sanctions and the establishment of a U.N. arms embargo against the Islamic republic .
By 2012 , the sanctions had been renewed and widened several more times and the Obama administration was pushing for a worldwide embargo on Iranian crude oil .

The difference today is that there is a real chance of achievement , Mr. Parsi said . He asserted that on two occasions over the past 12 years — in 2003 and in 2010 — authorities in Tehran made clear attempts to reach out to the West with overtures to resolve the nuclear crisis but were spurned both times by Washington .
“ The bottom line is this : Neither side has had completely clean hands when it comes to this enmity that exists between the Iran and the U.S. , ” Mr. Parsi said .
Regardless of the developments in Iran ’ s parliament , he said , Tehran will have no choice but to cooperate with the IAEA under terms of the deal in consideration .
“ The process that has been put into place , ” he said , “ does not require trust in Iran . It requires that the mechanism for verification of what the Iranians have committed themselves to doing is done and that if the Iranians cheat , they will be caught . ”
Skepticism still looms large , especially in light of evidence that Iranian authorities have continued to clash with the IAEA even as the past year and a half of negotiations have progressed .
One example was a confidential IAEA report in February that accused Iranian officials of failing to address accusations that they carried out explosives tests and other activities that could have been aimed at developing a nuclear bomb .

“Why would you design a deal that gives Iran nuclear and economic benefits before the IAEA reaches its conclusion about the peaceful nature of the Iranian program?” Mr. Dubowitz asked. “My contention is that this deeply flawed nuclear deal is going to make war more likely, not less likely, and when that war comes, Iran will be more powerful and the consequences will be more severe.”

WASHINGTON — President Obama signed an order Sunday directing his administration to begin issuing waivers to Iran nuclear sanctions — but the waivers will only go into effect once Iran meets its obligations under the agreement limiting its nuclear program.

The presidential memorandum marks what's being called ""adoption day"" for the international agreement intended to roll back Iran's nuclear program. The milestone, four administration officials said, is a mere formality, driven more by the calendar than by any action by Iran.

""Today marks an important milestone toward preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and ensuring its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful going forward,"" Obama said in a White House statement released Sunday afternoon.

Obama directed Secretary of State John Kerry to issue the waivers and to ""take all appropriate additional measures to ensure the prompt and effective implementation of the U.S. commitments"" in the agreement.

Sunday marks 90 days since the United Nations Security Council approved the agreement. ""So adoption day is a calendar-driven event and it’s the day at which all the parties begin to take the steps they need to make sure they take to get to implementation day,"" said State Department spokesman John Kirby. ""And we’re not at implementation day; that’s a whole different purpose.""

No date is set for implementation day. Under the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, implementation will come only when the International Atomic Energy Agency certifies that Iran has lived up to its obligations to reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium, dismantle two-thirds of its centrifuges, and halt construction of new nuclear facilities.

Western officials have said they expect that to take four to six months. Iran is motivated to act quickly, said one of the four senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the State Department.

The agreement, signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran, requires Obama and the European Union to direct the issuance of waivers on adoption day. Even though they won't go into effect for months, the arrangement allows businesses to know what sanctions are being waived, another senior administration official said.

""These next steps will allow us to reach the objectives we set out to achieve over the course of nearly two years of tough, principled diplomacy and will result in cutting off all four pathways Iran could use to develop enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said. ""I am confident in the extraordinary benefits to our national security and the peace and security of the world that come with the successful implementation of the (plan of action).""

Most of the sanctions being lifted apply only to non-U.S. citizens and companies doing business with Iran. Most sanctions will still apply to U.S. citizens under separate sanctions imposed on Iran for its support of terrorism and human rights violations. But sales of civilian passenger aircraft and handicrafts — most notably carpets — will be allowed.

The sanctions against Iran are authorized by Congress but implemented via executive order. Obama can waive those executive orders after Democrats in the Senate filibustered a resolution that would have blocked the agreement last month.

But the the adoption day comes amid renewed tensions with Iran over its involvement in Syria's civil war and its Oct. 10 test launch of a ballistic missile — reportedly capably of carrying a nuclear warhead.

But as he has throughout the negotiation, Obama maintained Friday that those issues are separate from the more urgent need to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.

""This is something that I made very clear during the debate around the Iran nuclear deal: The Iran nuclear deal solves a specific problem, which is making sure that they don't possess a nuclear weapon,"" he said after meeting with the South Korean president to discuss, among other things, North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

And so we are going to have to continue to put pressure on them through the international community and, where we have bilateral channels, through bilateral channels to indicate to them that there are costs to bad behavior in the region and around the world,"" Obama said.

In Munich on Saturday, a top Iranian military official said Iran was eager to cooperate with the international inspectors and would implement the agreement with ""utmost prudence.""

""It will be the gateway to Iran's taking next steps and will demonstrate the level of sincerity in the settlement of the problems which were created unjustly by others,"" the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, told Iran's state news agency.

`` With great sadness we confirm that three Americans were killed in the attack at CURE Hospital , '' said a statement posted on the Embassy 's Twitter page . `` No other information will be released at this time . ''
The shooting was the latest in a string of deadly attacks on foreign civilians in the Afghan capital this year .
Two of the dead Americans were a father and son , Minister of Health Soraya Dalil said , adding that the third American was a Cure International doctor who had worked for seven years in Kabul .
One of the doctors has been identified as Dr. Jerry Umanos , who practiced pediatric medicine at Lawndale Christian Health Center in Chicago , officials from the center said .
Dalil said an American nurse also was wounded in the attack .
`` A child specialist doctor who was working in this hospital for the last seven years for the people of Afghanistan was killed , and also two others who were here to meet him , and they were also American nationals , were killed , '' Dalil said . `` The two visitors were father and son , and a woman who was also in the visiting group was wounded . ''
The alleged attacker was a member of the Afghan Public Protection Force assigned to guard the hospital , according to District Police Chief Hafiz Khan . He said the man 's motive was not yet clear .
`` The shooter , who was not an employee of CURE , has been identified as a member of the security detail assigned to the hospital , shot himself after the attack , '' CURE Hospital said in a statement . `` He was initially treated at the CURE Hospital and has now been transferred out of our facility into the custody of the government of Afghanistan . ''
`` Five doctors had entered the compound of the hospital and were walking toward the building when the guard opened fire on them , '' Torkystani said . `` Three foreign doctors were killed . ''
According to its website , the Cure International Hospital was founded in 2005 by invitation of the Afghan Ministry of Health . It sees 37,000 patients a year , specializing in child and maternity health as well as general surgery . It is affiliated with the Christian charity Cure International , which operates in 29 countries with the motto `` curing the sick and proclaiming the kingdom of God . ''
The attacker had emerged from surgery in the afternoon and was in recovery at Cure International before being questioned , Dalil added .
The Afghan capital has seen a spate of attacks on foreign civilians in 2014 , a worrying new trend as the U.S.-led military coalition prepares to withdraw most troops by the end of the year .
It was unclear whether the Taliban were behind Thursday 's shooting , though the insurgents have claimed several major attacks that killed foreign civilians this year , an escalation after years of mostly targeting foreign military personnel and Afghan security forces .
In January , a Taliban attack on a popular Kabul restaurant with suicide bombers and gunmen killed more than a dozen people , while in March gunmen slipped past security at an upscale hotel in the Afghan capital and killed several diners in its restaurant . Two foreign journalists were killed and another wounded in two separate attacks .
The hospital shooting is also the second `` insider attack '' by a member of Afghan security forces targeting foreign civilians this month .
On April 4 , an Afghan police officer shot two Associated Press staff working in the eastern province of Khost , killing photographer Anja Niedringhaus and wounding veteran correspondent Kathy Gannon .","The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan confirmed Thursday that three American doctors -- including a father and son -- were killed by an Afghan security guard who opened fire at a Kabul hospital.

Chuck Schumer 's rebuke of President Barack Obama 's nuclear deal with Iran is stinging but it likely is n't enough to derail the historic accord .
The Republican-controlled Congress is expected to pass a measure disapproving of the deal , which Obama has pledged to veto . And despite Schumer 's move , both the administration and congressional Democrats supporting the Iran deal remain confident they have the votes to sustain the veto . They 're looking to the House of Representatives as the firewall to ensure the nuclear agreement can be implemented .
Schumer 's opposition was expected by Obama administration officials and most members of his party on Capitol Hill even if it 's fueling speculation that his prospects to become the next Senate Democratic leader could be damaged .
`` Not particularly surprising to anybody here at the White House , '' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said about Schumer 's decision to come out as a `` no '' vote , which he announced late Thursday .
Most Democrats understood the enormous political pressures Schumer , the highest-ranking Jewish lawmaker in Congress , felt from powerful interests in his home state , and say his longstanding positions on Mideast foreign policy made it a good bet he could n't back the deal .
But they also believed he would lay low and wait until shortly before the vote to publicly split with the administration . It was Schumer 's post on Medium giving a laundry list of reasons he thinks the deal has `` serious weaknesses '' that caught many Democrats off guard . And some say with several weeks left before the vote that lengthy analysis of what he views as the deal 's flaws could prove influential among undecided Democrats .
`` There is no denying that he was the one of the largest fish in the pool , which is why so much attention was centered on him from the very beginning , '' one senior House Democratic source told CNN .
In recent weeks , Schumer had individual meetings with Obama , Secretary of State John Kerry and lead negotiator Wendy Sherman . He also had dinner with Kerry , Sherman and Energy Secretary Ernest Moinz .
Given his decision , U.S. officials have complained that it 's unclear where all that work went , especially since they believe Schumer 's statement did n't reflect the substance of those conversations , either about the deal itself or the consequences if Congress were to vote it down .
Now that Schumer 's opposition is public , the big question is how actively he will lobby others to join him and vote to reject the deal .
According to multiple Democratic aides , Schumer spent Friday making calls to Senate colleagues and House Democrats from the New York delegation to tell them why he decided to oppose the deal . He also called the White House to let them know in advance of making his views public . Schumer planned to make calls to fellow Democratic members ahead of making his position public , but after the news was leaked late on Thursday he did n't get the chance to give members a heads up .
`` There are some who believe that I can force my colleagues to vote my way . While I will certainly share my view and try to persuade them that the vote to disapprove is the right one , in my experience with matters of conscience and great consequence like this , each member ultimately comes to their own conclusion , '' Schumer said in a written statement on Friday .
Other Democratic congressional sources are n't convinced he wo n't use some political pressure to push those on the fence over to his side , and say he will be closely watched in the coming weeks .
Despite the high profile break with Schumer , the math to get votes to override the president 's veto favors the administration at this point .
The White House needs one chamber to sustain the veto and procedurally , the first vote would be in the House , where Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-California , was an early supporter of the deal . She is a skilled vote counter and has worked diligently to move her caucus to support the President . Pelosi 's close coordination with the administration may also be a way for her to redeem herself after her own high profile split with the president on his trade bill earlier this summer .
Multiple House Democratic leadership aides continue to express confidence they have the votes . If all Republicans vote to override , they would need 44 House Democrats to join them to block the agreement . At this point , there are nine House Democrats who are publicly opposed .
House supporters also point to a letter signed by 151 House Democrats in May backing the administration 's negotiations with Iran on the nuclear deal . While the letter was n't an explicit endorsement of the deal unveiled last month , none of the members who signed onto that letter have publicly opposed the deal yet .
In the Senate , where Schumer 's voice is more influential , Republicans need to lock down 60 votes to clear a procedural vote to bring up a GOP resolution of disapproval . Schumer and New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez , who has been critical , are expected to vote with the 54 Senate Republicans likely to stand united against the deal , but that is still leaves the GOP four votes short of overcoming a Democratic filibuster .
Even if opponents get the votes to pass the resolution of disapproval in the Senate , they still need a total of 13 to block the nuclear deal . The No . 2 Senate Democrat , Dick Durbin of Illinois , is helping the administration round up votes , and several Democrats who were mum until recently , including Schumer 's junior senator , Kirsten Gillibrand , and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin , now say they will support the deal .
The remaining undecided Senate Democrats include Ben Cardin of Maryland , the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and Cory Booker of New Jersey . Both potentially face similar political pressures as Schumer from Jewish groups in their states who want the deal to fall apart .
Others who say they are still evaluating the agreement include Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut , Mark Warner of Virginia , Chris Coons of Delaware , Debbie Stabenow of Michigan , Gary Peters of Michigan , Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Jon Tester of Montana , Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota .

(CNN) – The leader of a panel charged with reviewing September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, said Sunday that criticism of his report was unfounded and did not accurately reflect how his review was carried out.

Thomas Pickering, a former ambassador and co-chair of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that critics at last week’s congressional hearing into the attack were wrong in their assertions his board failed to interview key witnesses.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, will hold the first in a new round of hearings on the subject on May 8.

In two letters to the State Department, dated April 16 and April 26, Issa has sought explicit guidance on how attorneys representing witnesses with knowledge of the Benghazi attacks, including their prelude and aftermath, can receive the security clearances necessary to review classified materials.

“Attorneys representing Department personnel in this matter will require clearance to possess and discuss Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information,” Issa wrote on April 16 to Mary McLeod, the principal deputy legal adviser to the State Department.

Updated at 5 p.m. ET

President Obama met with congressional leaders this afternoon to outline his strategy for confronting the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and Syria. He's also scheduled to address the nation on Wednesday night, to make that strategy public. It comes as a new poll by The Washington Post and ABC News shows a dramatic rise in U.S. public support for airstrikes against Islamist extremist groups.

Here's a look at several commentators on what the strategy might entail:

It Will Be Cautious

The Washington Post's David Ignatius writes: ""Yes, Obama does seem to have a strategy, and it gets pretty good marks from allies abroad. But many components aren't ready yet, and some aren't fully conceptualized.

""Obama's decision-making on Iraq and Syria has been the policy equivalent of the wariness that Abraham Lincoln famously characterized, in referring to Gen. George McClellan, as 'the slows,' "" Ignatius writes. ""Obama still worries about the potential costs of getting it wrong; he needs to focus more on getting it right, including building political support at home.""

It Will Be Different

The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib says Obama will stress how this time, it will be different — regional players will need to have ""skin in the game"":

""[He] will say this fight will be different from the ones his predecessor launched in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Seib writes. ""The soldiers on the front line this time, he will say, will have to be the very Sunni Arabs threatened by Islamic State's rise, not American troops sent to save them from it. That, he will imply, is the smart, not the stupid, way to take on the challenge.""

It Will Be Complex

Doyle McManus, writing for The Los Angeles Times:

""Recognizing the threat is easier than addressing it, though. The strategy, which Obama aides admit they are still 'building out,' has a daunting list of moving parts.

""It depends on Iraq's balky politicians to form a new government that can attract support from aggrieved Sunni Muslims.

""Then it requires organizing an international coalition against the Sunni-led Islamic State that includes Arab governments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iraq, whose leaders mostly loathe one another.""

And, It Will Take A Long Time

The New York Times says:

""The first phase, an air campaign with nearly 145 airstrikes in the past month, is already underway to protect ethnic and religious minorities and American diplomatic, intelligence and military personnel, and their facilities, as well as to begin rolling back ISIS gains in northern and western Iraq.

""The next phase ... is expected to involve an intensified effort to train, advise or equip the Iraqi military, Kurdish fighters and possibly members of Sunni tribes.

""The final, toughest and most politically controversial phase of the operation — destroying the terrorist army in its sanctuary inside Syria — might not be completed until the next administration. Indeed, some Pentagon planners envision a military campaign lasting at least 36 months.""",www.npr.org,center,JV2pUt25lPivHd0W

Why Mubarak was released

Officially, the case was dismissed on a technicality: prosecutors were supposed to follow a special procedure in May 2011 when they added Mubarak as a co-defendant to a pre-existing case, but they didn't file the paperwork in time. Of course, there is more going on here. Despite the judge's insistence that the ruling ""has nothing to do with politics,"" this is all about politics.

politics — not rule of law —guided this case from the beginning

The charges against Mubarak were always political. In February, 2011, he was ousted by popular revolution and by the military; shortly after, he was imprisoned on charges of corruption (for selling natural gas to Israel at below-market prices, for instance) and of murder, for ordering security forces to kill civilians who had gathered against him in protest. While the charges were almost certainly accurate — security forces did kill hundreds of protesters, and Mubarak's regime was notoriously corrupt — the case against him was rushed through to satisfy the revolutionary mood of the moment.

Now, the revolutionary mood is over. Egypt is today ruled by Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, a military dictator and secular nationalist just like Mubarak had been. (Also like Mubarak, Sisi has officially relinquished his military title.) Sisi's regime looks an awful lot like Mubarak's and includes a number of the same people. Under Mubarak, the Egyptian judiciary was a reliable political organ, staffed with regime loyalists; it remains so today.

The politics clearly favored Mubarak's release, and it is politics — not rule of law — that clearly guided this case from the beginning. (In May, Mubarak was sentenced to three years for a separate set of corruption charges, but he had already served three years as of the very month he was convicted, meaning his sentence is over and he has no outstanding charges.)

Mubarak's release is unsurprising, but hugely important symbolically

Sisi may not have ordered the judge to free Mubarak, but he wouldn't have to.

In the last four years, Egypt's political climate and state media have veered from the secular authoritarianism of Mubarak, to the secular liberalism of the 2011 revolution, to the Islamism of the 2012 democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government, and with Sisi's July 2013 coup back to secular authoritarianism.

The judges are smart enough to know who's in charge and how things are to work.

Sisi also glorifies himself as the continuation of the two beloved military leaders who preceded Mubarak, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar El Sadat. Mubarak also presented himself as a continuation of Nasser and Sadat.

This moment also signifies the turn in Egyptian popular opinion since 2011. In 2013, huge numbers of Egyptians protested to ask the military to stage a coup against the democratically-elected Muslim Brotherhood government, which had grown unpopular. Many of the same youths who had fought for democracy in 2011 cheered when the military seized power that summer and slaughtered Muslim Brotherhood supporters in the streets. Public attitudes toward Mubarak are not exactly warm, but the idea of a Mubarak-style military dictatorship has become popular again.

And there is also a high degree of exhaustion with politics in Egypt. The economy is in tatters; years of protests and turmoil have ultimately left very few Egyptians better off. These are all reasons why, for the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who protested to depose and imprison Mubarak in 2011, only a few hundred gathered in Cairo when he was released on Saturday.

The Afghan president signaled he was not prepared to sign the agreement during a meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice . According to the White House , he outlined `` new conditions '' for signing it , just days after a tentative deal had been reached .
The White House said Monday that Rice responded by saying this would mean the U.S. would then start planning to pull out all its forces after 2014 , adding that a signed agreement is necessary to plan for thousands of troops to stay in the country to train and mentor Afghan security forces to face the Taliban .
`` Without a prompt signature , the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan , '' she told the Afghan president .
Their meeting in Kabul came the day after Karzai 's surprise decision to ignore Sunday 's recommendation by an Afghan assembly of dignitaries to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement , a refusal that cast doubt on whether American and allied troops would remain in Afghanistan to train Afghan forces after most foreign troops withdraw next year .
According to Karzai 's office , he told Rice during Monday 's meeting that he would n't back down from that decision , deferring it to whoever succeeds him as president in April elections .
Karzai announced his decision at a gathering of 2,500 tribal elders and regional leaders known as a Loya Jirga , even though the council not only overwhelmingly approved the deal after a four-day meeting but urged him to sign it by Dec. 31 .
Washington has asked him to change his mind . But the mercurial Karzai , in the meeting with Rice , says he laid out a series of new demands -- albeit ones mostly involving steps the U.S. has already said it would take .
One new demand was that the United States should address a suggestion by the Loya Jirga that all Afghan prisoners be released from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
According to the statement , Karzai `` said the United States of America should respond to the suggestion mentioned in the resolution of the Loya Jirga to free all the Afghan prisoners in Guantanamo . ''
There are nearly 20 Afghans currently being held at the American facility in Cuba .
Karzai 's office said that in the meeting with Rice , he also asked for further assurances from the United States that its forces will not raid Afghan homes and that America express a sincere commitment to help start stalled peace talks with the Taliban . He also reiterated his demand that the United States commit to holding free and transparent elections on April 5 .
The statement further added that Karzai asked Rice to convey his concerns about the raids and peace talks to President Barack Obama so that he can `` give assurances regarding the issues to the Afghan people . ''
Obama has already addressed the issue of raids in a letter to Karzai last week that was read to the assembly .
In it , Obama assured Karzai that under the agreement , the U.S. will continue to respect `` Afghan sovereignty . '' He also said the U.S. military will not conduct raids on homes except under `` extraordinary circumstances '' involving urgent risks to U.S. nationals .
The US has repeatedly urged Karzai to sign a deal that would allow about 8,000 American troops to stay in the country beyond a 2014 withdrawal deadline .
The two-term Afghan leader has insisted that the winner of an April 5 election to succeed him should be the one to sign the deal . More than $ 8 billion in annual funds for Afghanistan 's fledgling security forces and development assistance also are at stake .
Karzai may be concerned about his legacy , worried he might be seen as responsible for an agreement that some Afghans will likely see as selling out to foreign interests .
Karzai 's statement said that Rice told the Afghan president that the U.S. was committed to transparent elections that will be held on time and without interference as prescribed by Afghan law .
It added that Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , the top U.S. and coalition commander , told Karzai he had ordered his troops `` to act according to the security agreement and suggestions of the consultative Loya Jirga . ''
But is also said Rice did not provide a commitment on the peace talks .
Karzai has blamed the United States for the collapse of talks that were to be held at a Taliban office in the Gulf State of Qatar .
The Taliban office , which opened in Doha last June after talks between the United States and Qatar , closed after Karzai accused the religious movement of trying to set up a government-in-exile by identifying its office as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .
A furious Karzai told the Loya Jirga delegates on Sunday that Obama had promised him the Taliban would not open an embassy .
Rice met with Karzai at the end of a previously unannounced three-day trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops and civilians for the Thanksgiving holidays , the White House said , adding that the meeting was at Karzai 's request . Her spokesman , Patrick Ventrell , said the meeting was the last stop on her trip .
Karzai , who had convened the Loya Jirga , complicated the debate by announcing on the opening day that he wanted delegates to endorse the deal but he would not sign it .
He repeated that stance Sunday laying down a series of ill-defined conditions and promising to continue negotiations with the United States . They included demands that America ensure peace in a country that has been at war for more than 12 years and guarantee transparent elections .
Karzai , who is constitutionally barred from running in the upcoming presidential vote , also accused the United States of meddling in the 2009 elections , which were marred by fraud , and said he wanted to keep that from happening again .

“ He was an inspiration for us and so many others , '' said John Foley , his eyes tearing and his voice catching . `` We miss his courage , his love , his determination , his laugh and his smile . ”
Foley , a New Hampshire-born journalist who specialized in chronicling life in the world 's most dangerous places , disappeared in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost . Foley , who had previosuly worked in Afghanistan for Stars and Stripes , was not seen or heard from again until the shocking and brutal video , in which his executioner blamed U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State in Iraq , surfaced .
Foley had been kidnapped previously in Libya , but had been freed and then returned to the craft he loved .
His mother called for compassion from her son 's killers , who are holding another American journalist , Steven Sotloff , who they have also threatened to kill .
“ Jim ’ s death can bring our country together in a stronger way in the values that Jim held dear , ” said Diane Foley , who spoke with her husband from their home in the Granite State . “ He never wanted us to hate or be bitter . ”
U.S. intelligence officials were analyzing Wednesday a video released by Islamic militants showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley , focusing on identifying the surrounding landscape and the British accent of his executioner .
The identification of his killer is said to be of top importance to U.S. and European intelligence officials .
The video -- originally posted by ISIS to YouTube , which later took the video down -- also shows an ISIS militant standing over a second man dressed similarly to Foley in an orange jumpsuit . The video identifies the second man as American journalist Steven Sotloff , and warns that he , too , could be killed . Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013 , and freelanced for Time , the National Interest and MediaLine .
White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden confirmed the video ’ s authenticity Wednesday . U.S. officials who asked not to be identified earlier told ███ that the man beheaded in the video is Foley .
The orange jumpsuits worn by both captives in the video are synonymous in Jihadi propaganda with Guantanamo Bay and the first wave of prisoners who were held there at Camp X-Ray .
███ has learned that the video , which is being taken seriously by U.S. officials , is being analyzed by a group within the U.S. intelligence community that specializes in media exploitation . The Islamic State militant group , formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , is believed to have other Americans in their custody .
An intelligence source told ███ that the landscape of the video is being analyzed to determine a likely location . Investigators also are planning to analyze the voices in the tape , including the masked executioner who appears to speak with a British accent , and whether or not the individual is linked to Britons known to have traveled to Syria .
British officials have said that several hundred people from Britain have traveled to Syria to join the battle against President Bashar Assad , and some may have crossed into Iraq as part of the rapid advance of the Islamic State group . French and German officials have recently put the combined total of those countries around 1,300 .

Earlier Tuesday , GlobalPost CEO and co-founder Philip Balboni in a statement asked `` for your prayers for Jim and his family . '' AFP chairman Emmanuel Hoog said the French news agency was `` horrified '' by the video and called Foley `` a brave , independent and impartial journalist . ''","The parents of James Foley, the American photojournalist whose horrific beheading by Islamic militants was shown on a YouTube video Tuesday night, called their son a hero and an inspiration who ""didn't deserve to be slaughtered"" in an emotional news conference Wednesday.

“He was an inspiration for us and so many others,"" said John Foley, his eyes tearing and his voice catching. ""We miss his courage, his love, his determination, his laugh and his smile.”

Foley, a New Hampshire-born journalist who specialized in chronicling life in the world's most dangerous places, disappeared in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. Foley, who had previosuly worked in Afghanistan for Stars and Stripes, was not seen or heard from again until the shocking and brutal video, in which his executioner blamed U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State in Iraq, surfaced.

Foley had been kidnapped previously in Libya, but had been freed and then returned to the craft he loved.

""This was his passion,"" John Foley said.

His mother called for compassion from her son's killers, who are holding another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, who they have also threatened to kill.

“Jim’s death can bring our country together in a stronger way in the values that Jim held dear,” said Diane Foley, who spoke with her husband from their home in the Granite State. “He never wanted us to hate or be bitter.”

U.S. intelligence officials were analyzing Wednesday a video released by Islamic militants showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley, focusing on identifying the surrounding landscape and the British accent of his executioner.

The identification of his killer is said to be of top importance to U.S. and European intelligence officials.

The video -- originally posted by ISIS to YouTube, which later took the video down -- also shows an ISIS militant standing over a second man dressed similarly to Foley in an orange jumpsuit. The video identifies the second man as American journalist Steven Sotloff, and warns that he, too, could be killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013, and freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.

White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden confirmed the video’s authenticity Wednesday. U.S. officials who asked not to be identified earlier told Fox News that the man beheaded in the video is Foley.

The orange jumpsuits worn by both captives in the video are synonymous in Jihadi propaganda with Guantanamo Bay and the first wave of prisoners who were held there at Camp X-Ray.

Fox News has learned that the video, which is being taken seriously by U.S. officials, is being analyzed by a group within the U.S. intelligence community that specializes in media exploitation. The Islamic State militant group, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is believed to have other Americans in their custody.

An intelligence source told Fox News that the landscape of the video is being analyzed to determine a likely location. Investigators also are planning to analyze the voices in the tape, including the masked executioner who appears to speak with a British accent, and whether or not the individual is linked to Britons known to have traveled to Syria.

British officials have said that several hundred people from Britain have traveled to Syria to join the battle against President Bashar Assad, and some may have crossed into Iraq as part of the rapid advance of the Islamic State group. French and German officials have recently put the combined total of those countries around 1,300.

Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King's College London, said the video was evidence that British jihadis were ""some of the most vicious and vociferous fighters"" in Syria and Iraq.

The masked militant in the clip speaks fluent English with what Lancaster University linguist Claire Hardaker said sounds like a London accent.

It is Islamist-leftist dogma that Israel’s millennia of attachment to its homeland count for nothing.

Adding a final shameful chapter to a foreign-policy record that already runneth over with them, Barack Obama on Friday abandoned America’s commitment to Israel’s security, and to the vindication of democracy over sharia-supremacist aggression. In an act of cowardly venom, the president had the United States abstain from — and thereby effectively enact — a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemns Israeli settlement activity.

EDITORIAL: Obama’s Shameful Parting Shot at Israel

Nevertheless, Israel did not set out to conquer the disputed territory. The Jewish state took it fair and square when they won the defensive war against enemies that sought Israel’s destruction. Thus the unending pattern that the United States and Western European powers cravenly refuse to address: Islamic factions and nations are free to reserve the right to eradicate Israel, but Israel must pretend the aggression never happened and the continuing threat does not exist.

He says limited strike may be risky but less so than doing nothing or trying for regime change
Miller : If Obama does n't act after large chemical weapons attack , he 'll be written off as ineffective
Among the most enduring urban legends about high-level policy-making in the U.S. government is the proverbial memo with three options : 1. do nothing ; 2. do everything ; 3. find a middle ground and muddle through .
And yet in truth , Barack Obama really does have only three options in Syria . It appears that the president , rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria , has chosen option three , the least bad alternative . And here 's why .
This is n't really an option . Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad 's use of chemical weapons . Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988 ; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict ; and the president is accused of fiddling , Nero-like , while Syria burns .
Just focus on the events of the past five days in Washington . What has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare . Rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation , its size and character .
Combine that with the Secretary of State John Kerry 's brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president 's PBS interview , and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable .
Indeed , forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line . And if the president does n't enforce it , he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term .
Neither his regional allies ( Israel and the Saudis ) nor his adversaries ( Iran , Hezbollah , Russia ) will find him credible or believable . As it is now , everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence .

He says limited strike may be risky but less so than doing nothing or trying for regime change

Miller: If Obama doesn't act after large chemical weapons attack, he'll be written off as ineffective

Among the most enduring urban legends about high-level policy-making in the U.S. government is the proverbial memo with three options: 1. do nothing; 2. do everything; 3. find a middle ground and muddle through.

And yet in truth, Barack Obama really does have only three options in Syria. It appears that the president, rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria, has chosen option three, the least bad alternative. And here's why.

Do nothing

This isn't really an option. Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons. Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict; and the president is accused of fiddling, Nero-like, while Syria burns.

Aaron David Miller

Just focus on the events of the past five days in Washington. What has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare. Rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation, its size and character.

Combine that with the Secretary of State John Kerry's brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president's PBS interview, and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable.

Indeed, forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line. And if the president doesn't enforce it, he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term.

Neither his regional allies (Israel and the Saudis) nor his adversaries (Iran, Hezbollah, Russia) will find him credible or believable. As it is now, everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence.

Do everything

From the beginning, Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on Syria, even suggesting that the president, by not acting sooner, enabled all of this misery to unfold. Syria, the president's critics maintain, is a major threat to U.S. interests -- and to our allies in the region -- and only a takedown of the al-Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem.

The argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no-fly zones, the use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition.

President Obama has wisely and willfully avoided this approach. And he continues to avoid it now. The reason has to do with the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state.

The first is a falsehood. For three reasons.

First, the alternative to this agreement was continuing and tightening the sanctions that were weakening the Iranian regime and greatly diminishing its ability to fund terror groups around the world. Second, because the agreement so strengthens Iran, it makes war far more likely. When evil, expansionist regimes get richer, they don’t spend their wealth on building new hospitals. Third, because we have been at war with Iran for decades. But only one side has been fighting.

With national elections eight weeks away , Israeli politicians tried to showcase accomplishments without raising expectations .
“ It could last nine months or it could last nine weeks , ” Defense Minister Ehud Barak said of the cease-fire . “ When it does not last , we will know what to do . We see clearheadedly the possibility that we will have to do this again . ”
And so it went on the day after the latest round in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict . What was widely heralded as a game changer by Palestinian politicians and independent analysts alike was viewed by Israeli officials and commentators as a maintenance mission that had succeeded in its stated goals : restoring quiet after months of intensifying rocket fire , and culling the weapons cache of Gaza ’ s armed groups .
Details of the cease-fire agreement announced Wednesday by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Egyptian foreign minister remained unclear . Both sides pledged to stop the violence , and Palestinians say Israel will loosen its restrictions on fishing off Gaza ’ s Mediterranean coastline and farming along its northern and eastern borders . But the critical question of whether the border crossings would be open wide for people and commerce was not fully addressed , with only a vague promise that discussions would ensue after 24 hours . The exact agenda , time , location and even participants in these discussions have not been announced .
At the same time , Mustafa Barghouti , a West Bank leader who has spent the past several days in Gaza , said the Palestinian factions had agreed to meet in Cairo for another round of unity talks in the next few days , as President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority prepares to take his case for observer-state status to the United Nations next week . Though Hamas and Fatah , the party Mr. Abbas leads , have signed four reconciliation agreements in the five years since Hamas took control of Gaza after winning elections here , Mr. Barghouti said this time was different .
“ Hamas is stronger , of course , and Abbas is having to change his line because negotiations failed , ” he said after appearing with Mr. Haniya at a rally . “ This time Israel felt the heat of the Arab Spring , and Gaza was not isolated ; the whole Arab world was here . The road is open for unity . ”
First , though , Hamas faces an enormous rebuilding effort , with at least 10 of its government buildings — including the ministries of culture , education and interior ; the prime minister ’ s headquarters ; and police stations — now reduced to rubble littered with payroll sheets and property tax rolls . A spokesman said that the government kept most records on laptops , but the Abu Khadra , a huge complex of constituent services , is gone .
Dr. Hassan Khalaf , director of Al Shifa Hospital , which was not attacked , dismissed the worry . “ We can gather under the sky under a tent , ” he said . “ They can come to my house . ”
In Jerusalem , Dan Meridor , a senior minister of intelligence and atomic energy , told reporters that Israel had “ used force in a very moderate and measured way. ” He said the military had struck 10 times the number of targets compared with the previous government ’ s invasion of Gaza four years ago but killed far fewer people than during that invasion : slightly over 10 percent . One of the main military achievements , he said , was the destruction of most of the long-range Iranian Fajr-5 missiles in Gaza .

Responding to criticism from the far right and many residents of the south that Israel did not go far enough by failing to cripple Hamas , Mr. Meridor said : “ Could we win Gaza from Hamas ? Obviously , if we decide to do it . Then we have to ask ourselves what we will do once we are there . ”
Analysts said that by stopping short of a ground invasion , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emerged from the crisis looking like a moderate , responsible leader , not a trigger-happy adventurer . Currently facing no credible rival for the premiership , he also can campaign on an improved relationship with President Obama , who , according to Israeli officials , displayed no vindictiveness as he helped mediate the dispute , despite the widely held perception that Mr. Netanyahu had supported Mitt Romney . He can claim credit for the start of a mechanism for better communication with Egypt ’ s new leadership .
“ Everybody wanted a situation where they could not have a ground operation and they could have Hamas sing ‘ Hatikva , ’ ” said Gadi Wolfsfeld , a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya , Israel , referring to the Israeli national anthem . “ Frankly , I have to say kudos to Netanyahu , and I don ’ t usually pay him compliments . I think he got the best out of a bad situation . ”
Of course there were mixed feelings . On Mr. Netanyahu ’ s Facebook page , Gila Glickerman , the mother of a combat soldier , thanked the prime minister for bringing her son home , while Shai Solomon wrote , “ You ’ ve just lost a vote at the ballot box . ”
Orly Peretz , a mother of five who lives in Ashkelon — one of the southern cities hardest hit by the approximately 1,500 rockets fired from Gaza in the latest conflict — said she felt relaxed Thursday for the first time in a long time , and was unconcerned about what Israel might have relinquished in the cease-fire . “ It doesn ’ t matter how it comes about ; people want their quiet , ” she said . But Linda Kabuli , who owns a salon in the even harder-hit town of Sderot , said she would have preferred a ground invasion “ to eliminate every terrorist . ”
“ This is Hamas ’ s victory , the terrorists , ” Ms. Kabuli said . “ And the proof is that they got up and danced and sang . Today is a holiday for them ; it ’ s not a day of mourning . ”
There were , actually , still funerals going on in Gaza City , but Hamas declared Nov. 22 a national holiday not just this year but going forward . Women , not seen much in public in the past week , ventured to the hairdresser . Men waited at an A.T.M . to withdraw money . Teenage boys spooned ice cream from waffle cones on a street corner . Shopkeepers swept debris , and people snapped pictures of the devastation on smartphones .
Everything was different , not just from the previous day , but from earlier this month , when Hamas had prevented Fatah from holding a rally commemorating the anniversary of Yasir Arafat ’ s death , and from March , when Islamic Jihad accused Hamas of giving up on resistance after it had struggled to contain Israel-bound rocket fire from more militant groups .
Thursday morning , minutes after five masked men from Islamic Jihad declared victory before a bank of news cameras , hundreds of Fatah members paraded past the same point with pictures of Mr. Arafat , as Hamas security officials kept order .
“ It ’ s the first time in 70 years I feel proud and my head is high , ” said Mohamed Rajah , 71 , a refugee from Haifa who had kissed the militants when they arrived . “ It ’ s a great victory for the people of Palestine . Nobody says it ’ s Hamas , nobody says it ’ s Islamic Jihad or Fatah — Palestine only . ”","But there was collective relief in Israel as thousands of army reservists, sent to the Gaza border ahead of a possible ground invasion, gradually began returning home.

Orly Peretz, a mother of five who lives in Ashkelon — one of the southern cities hardest hit by the approximately 1,500 rockets fired from Gaza in the latest conflict — said she felt relaxed Thursday for the first time in a long time, and was unconcerned about what Israel might have relinquished in the cease-fire. “It doesn’t matter how it comes about; people want their quiet,” she said. But Linda Kabuli, who owns a salon in the even harder-hit town of Sderot, said she would have preferred a ground invasion “to eliminate every terrorist.”

“This is Hamas’s victory, the terrorists,” Ms. Kabuli said. “And the proof is that they got up and danced and sang. Today is a holiday for them; it’s not a day of mourning.”

There were, actually, still funerals going on in Gaza City, but Hamas declared Nov. 22 a national holiday not just this year but going forward. Women, not seen much in public in the past week, ventured to the hairdresser. Men waited at an A.T.M. to withdraw money. Teenage boys spooned ice cream from waffle cones on a street corner. Shopkeepers swept debris, and people snapped pictures of the devastation on smartphones.

Everything was different, not just from the previous day, but from earlier this month, when Hamas had prevented Fatah from holding a rally commemorating the anniversary of Yasir Arafat’s death, and from March, when Islamic Jihad accused Hamas of giving up on resistance after it had struggled to contain Israel-bound rocket fire from more militant groups.

Thursday morning, minutes after five masked men from Islamic Jihad declared victory before a bank of news cameras, hundreds of Fatah members paraded past the same point with pictures of Mr. Arafat, as Hamas security officials kept order.

“It’s the first time in 70 years I feel proud and my head is high,” said Mohamed Rajah, 71, a refugee from Haifa who had kissed the militants when they arrived. “It’s a great victory for the people of Palestine. Nobody says it’s Hamas, nobody says it’s Islamic Jihad or Fatah — Palestine only.”",www.nytimes.com,left,g3ltsH7vAcuZYBVY

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

As the U.S. government reportedly plans to cut back significantly on its aid to Egypt against the wishes of key Arab allies and Israel, a question looms over the American relationship with one of the most important countries in the region: Who lost Egypt?

The answer starts June 4, 2009, with President Obama’s speech, “A New Beginning,” at Cairo University in which he outlined — only a few months after his first inauguration — what he considered the future of U.S. relations in the Middle East.

“I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed, confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice,” Mr. Obama told the audience.

Many of those throughout the Arab world took the president at his word. But the promises turned out to be rather hollow.

“Contradictory diplomatic and military messages suggest how enfeebled the U.S. has become in dealing with one of its closest allies in the Middle East,” Jonathan Guyer, a senior editor of the Cairo Review of Global Affairs, wrote this week. “In fact, Washington does not even know what it expects from Cairo.”

So what went wrong?

The Western journalistic community that embraced the 2011 demonstrations against undemocratic and corrupt governments throughout the Arab world, including Egypt, often played the role of cheerleaders, failing to understand how autocratic forces like the Muslim Brotherhood hijacked the political process.

At the outset, it is important to understand that the term Arab Spring is abhorrent to many Egyptians and almost everyone who knows much about the country — one of the many erroneous reporting memes from Western journalists. For one thing, three seasons — which don’t include spring — exist in Egypt: the flooding of the Nile (roughly June through September), the growing of crops (roughly October through February), and the harvest that lasts from March through May.

The term Arab Spring — apparently used first by the Christian Science Monitor and Foreign Policy — irked Arab writers like Rami Khouri of the Beirut-based Daily Star. He noted that the protesters themselves preferred the words revolution, or “thawra” in Arabic, and awakening, or “sahwa.”

Arab Spring also rings hollow because it can refer to the failed Prague Spring of 1968, which Russian troops put down brutally, or the Spring of Nations in Europe of 1848, which also arguably resulted in little change.

During Egypt’s election campaign, many journalists and the Obama team failed to understand the Muslim Brotherhood, a group many reporters described as “moderate,” a term I rejected from the outset. Mohammed Morsi, the head of a party backed by the Brotherhood, won roughly 25 percent of the votes in the first round of the elections in late May 2012. In a runoff election against a discredited crony of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Ahmed Shafik, Mr. Morsi won 51.7 percent of the vote to 48.3 for Mr. Shafik. That’s hardly a resounding endorsement.

Within months, Mr. Morsi essentially had declared himself the supreme ruler of the country and led Egypt through the arrest and torture of opponents, along with the collapse of the economy that left many people without food.

Western journalists and the Obama team described the Muslim Brotherhood as the democratically elected government. After 14 million Egyptians protested against the Brotherhood, the military took over, albeit with a heavy hand that I abhor. Nevertheless, the reduction in foreign aid to Egypt is likely to make relations significantly worse rather than bringing about democratic change — if that is the administration’s intention.

Who lost Egypt? The Obama administration has made numerous errors, while Western journalists have played a significant role in losing one of our most important allies.

(CNN) -- ""Mr. Speaker, We are being slaughtered, we are being exterminated,"" cried out Vian Dakhil in a devastating appeal to the Iraqi parliament that deserves the attention of the entire world.

Everyone should watch.

The Iraqi legislator, a member of the country's Yazidi minority, collapsed at the end of her heartbreaking plea, imploring her country to stop the genocide of her people. ""In the name of humanity,"" she said, ""Save us! Save us!""

The Yazidis are caught in the brutal march of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, the extremist Jihadi organization. It has called itself the Islamic State, and has anointed itself the caliphate and its leader the ruler of all the world's Muslims.

ISIS is carving a path of destruction as it sets its sights on imposing its rule, and its interpretation of Islam, on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and beyond. In the process of achieving its military gains, ISIS is massing large caches of weaponry, taking over oil fields in Iraq, filling its coffers with cash and developing what could eventually become enormous military, economic and political power, if it is able to achieve its objectives.

Preventing genocide, saving the Yazidis, is an imperative humanitarian goal in itself. But stopping ISIS, the al Qaeda offshoot that is too extreme even for al Qaeda, is important for preventing an even more disastrous turn in the boiling Middle East, and it is indispensable for global stability.

It wasn't just Dakhil asking for help, and it's not only up to the dysfunctional Iraqi parliament to provide support. There is an important role for world powers -- for the United States -- in helping save the Middle East from one of the most ruthless and dangerous organizations operating today in one of the most important parts of the globe.

Who is the ISIS?

Iraq's Kurds, in the north of the country, are brave and determined. They love the United States, which twice helped them survive the genocidal efforts of Saddam Hussein. Their army, known as the Peshmerga (""those who confront death,"" in Kurdish), have been fighting against ISIS, but they are outgunned. That's partly because the Iraqi army dropped its (American) weapons and fled when ISIS rolled in from Syria and captured Mosul.

The Kurds are prepared to challenge ISIS, and there is no one better to do it. They are moderate, pro-Western, committed to a multiethnic, religiously diverse Iraq and ready for the challenge. They have everything to gain from victory and everything to lose from defeat. America should help arm them. Skeptics have worried that by helping to stop the Sunnis of ISIS, the United States would be siding with Shiite Iran. But the Kurds are the perfect way to avoid that binary trap.

Opponents of arming the Kurds also worry that it might add to the disintegration of Iraq. That is not necessarily the case. If Iraq survives, it should do so only as a federal state, in which Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds share power.

If Iraq does not survive, and Iraqi Kurds at long last get a state of their own, it would hardly be a catastrophic outcome.

middle_east,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/25/crisis-in-kabul-security-at-us-embassy-in-disarray/,"Crisis in Kabul: Security at U.S. Embassy in disarray, diplomats at risk",2013-07-25,Sara Carter,"U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan have serious security lapses that pose “ unnecessary risk to staff , ” including poor emergency preparedness and inadequate protections that might allow classified materials to fall into the hands of attacking enemies , according to an internal report that raises fresh questions about the State Department ’ s commitment to safety in the aftermath of the Benghazi tragedy .
The confidential State Department inspector general ’ s report , obtained by The ███ under the Freedom of Information Act , directly criticizes the department ’ s Bureau of Diplomatic Security for failing to perform a physical inspection before approving the security plan for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul , which was the target of a brash attack by Taliban insurgents two years ago .
When IG investigators inspected the embassy in Kabul , they found inadequate emergency shelters , food , water rations , medical supplies and backup communication equipment that would be essential to repel or survive an attack , according to the report , which was released to The Times partly redacted for security reasons .
Similar inspections elsewhere found the U.S. diplomatic post in Afghanistan ’ s western city of Herat lacked an emergency action plan instructing employees on how to respond to an attack and that a Provincial Reconstruction Team outpost in Qala-e-Naw lacked an agreement with allied forces to provide a military response in case of attack .
“ The lack of adequate emergency shelters [ redacted ] the lack of sufficient emergency supplies and equipment , the lack of redundancy in communications , the [ redacted ] absence of an agreement with the non-Department law enforcement on emergency assistance , and the inability to identify and destroy sensitive material unnecessarily increased the risk of injury to embassy staff and of compromising sensitive material during an emergency situation , ” the report warns .
The problems with security planning and resources aren ’ t the only red flags for the safety of American diplomats in Afghanistan .
A separate report this summer from the office of the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction found that U.S. civilian and military personnel face increased security risks because officials at the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development don ’ t have “ express authority to terminate or default contracts ” with known Afghan contractors connected to enemy forces . Only the Defense Department has the authority , the report found .
In other words , enemy fighters are in a position to use American tax dollars paid to criminal Afghan contractors to attack U.S. troops and personnel , the special inspector general ’ s report warned .
State Department officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment over the past week . But the Obama administration recently called for extensive funding to fortify its outposts , and Secretary of State John F. Kerry told trainees at the Foreign Service Institute recently that diplomatic outposts need “ the resources and the support and the investments that make the risks that we take today worthwhile . ”
The vulnerabilities identified in the two inspector general reports are all the more stark given that the Kabul embassy sustained a significant attack Sept. 13 , 2011 , that left some employees with minor injuries and the facility with damage .
“ While there were no deaths or serious injuries in the 9/13 attack , there was unnecessary risk to staff during the 9/13 attack because of a lack of these resources and protections , ” the State Department inspector general ’ s report said .
An after-action review of the 2011 attack found that the Kabul embassy :
• Was hindered in its ability to communicate emergency messages to its personnel because of unreliable alarm and voice broadcasting equipment .
• Generated confusion among employees about when , and for what purposes , they should use their cellphones during an emergency .
• Employed law enforcement personnel who were “ unsure as to what emergency response role they were expected to play , if any ” during the attack .
• Lacked a complete inventory of documentation , electronic data and sensitive equipment that would require destruction during an emergency .
The March report , titled Evaluation of Emergency Action Plans for U.S. Mission Afghanistan , is one of numerous inspector general reports released over the past year warning of weak diplomatic security around the globe . The reports , which focus on high-threat diplomatic posts in war zones or dangerous regions , uncovered systemic failures by State Department officials and security personnel in protecting employees overseas .
In fact , the State Department report noted that the current emergency action plan in Kabul “ did not reflect the increased threat in Kabul or the significant growth in staffing levels at Embassy Kabul from 2009 to 2012 . ”
The Bureau of Counterterrorism ’ s 2011 country reports on terrorism stated that the number of attacks increased in Afghanistan from 1,122 in 2007 to 2,872 in 2011 . In fact , “ six of the ten major attacks in Afghanistan during 2011 were in Kabul , two of those attacks were on diplomatic facilities ” and a number of hotels frequented by Westerners were attacked .
Concern about embassy security soared after the deadly attack on Sept. 11 , 2012 , by an al Qaeda affiliate on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya . The attack killed U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three U.S. contractors working in the war-torn region .
James Carafano , a senior defense analyst with the Heritage Foundation , said the systemic failures unmasked by the various inspector general reports must be addressed by a congressional investigation .
“ One of the reasons why it was so important to get to the bottom of what happened at Benghazi was not to play political ‘ gotcha ’ but to understand what went wrong and why so if systemic problems were identified they could be addressed , ” Mr. Carafano said .
“ We still have not gotten all the answers to the important question , but now we are getting additional information that suggests that there are shortfalls in security at other “ high-risk ” missions , embassies and consulates so maybe we do have a larger problem here and it is starting to look like the Benghazi-cover-up helped mask these larger issues , ” he said .
The Obama administration came under fire from Republican lawmakers after Susan E. Rice , as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , went on the Sunday talk shows five days after the Benghazi tragedy and suggested that the attack was a spontaneous riot instigated by an anti-Islamic video distributed on the Internet .
It was discovered later that Stevens had called the State Department for help , the attack was well-organized by the al Qaeda affiliate , and no U.S. military reaction force was summoned to help .
Questions keep mounting about how much the State Department has done to address security vulnerabilities .
The Washington Guardian reported in February that U.S. embassies and diplomatic facilities around the world had exempted themselves from security requirements without the knowledge of senior officials in Washington .
Then in June , the agency ’ s inspector general warned that failure by State Department officials to adequately protect U.S. diplomats in Beirut left them vulnerable to growing militant groups in the region . At the time of the report , State Department officials had not placed the embassy in Beirut on its latest list of high-threat diplomatic missions even though Lebanon is listed at the “ critical ” threat level for violence with rocket attacks and small-arms fire from the Syrian civil war .
Shortly after The ███ reported on the issue , State Department officials placed Beirut on the high-threat list .
A U.S. military official , who worked in security advisory roles in Iraq and Afghanistan for more than eight years , told The Times that one problem is that the “ selection of an embassy facility is sometimes based more on aesthetics than security. ” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
During the September 2011 attacks in Kabul , armed Taliban militants fired small arms from the rooftops of high-rise buildings surrounding the embassy . They also targeted the headquarters of NATO ’ s International Security Assistance Forces , where senior U.S. commanders work and reside . The complex attack also included targeted suicide bombings of police and military checkpoints in the city .
“ Many times , security is not the emphasis during the planning process but it ’ s more of a check-the-block afterthought , ” the official said . “ Basically , you can ’ t put an embassy underneath unsecure overhanging structures . In the case of Kabul , they did and according to the IG report the embassy failed on multiple fronts to ensure their employees safety based on what was required by the [ emergency action plan ] . They were lucky no one died in the embassy attack . “
The official noted that failure to inspect facilities routinely also place employees and U.S. assets at risk .
Mr. Carafano said the State Department can not use sequester cuts as an excuse not to protect its employees because the department ’ s security funding was increased “ dramatically ” after the September attacks in Benghazi .
“ The Department of State has been at war with al Qaeda longer than anyone . Since the bombings at the U.S. embassies in Africa in the 1990s , they have had to defend their personnel in some of the most dangerous places on earth . It is incredible to believe that more than a decade after Sept. 11 there are shortfalls in this mission , ” Mr. Carafano said .","U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan have serious security lapses that pose “unnecessary risk to staff,” including poor emergency preparedness and inadequate protections that might allow classified materials to fall into the hands of attacking enemies, according to an internal report that raises fresh questions about the State Department’s commitment to safety in the aftermath of the Benghazi tragedy.

“While there were no deaths or serious injuries in the 9/13 attack, there was unnecessary risk to staff during the 9/13 attack because of a lack of these resources and protections,” the State Department inspector general’s report said.

An after-action review of the 2011 attack found that the Kabul embassy:

• Stored rations and supplies in unsecured containers.

• Was hindered in its ability to communicate emergency messages to its personnel because of unreliable alarm and voice broadcasting equipment.

• Generated confusion among employees about when, and for what purposes, they should use their cellphones during an emergency.

• Employed law enforcement personnel who were “unsure as to what emergency response role they were expected to play, if any” during the attack.

• Lacked a complete inventory of documentation, electronic data and sensitive equipment that would require destruction during an emergency.

Systemic security failures

The March report, titled Evaluation of Emergency Action Plans for U.S. Mission Afghanistan, is one of numerous inspector general reports released over the past year warning of weak diplomatic security around the globe. The reports, which focus on high-threat diplomatic posts in war zones or dangerous regions, uncovered systemic failures by State Department officials and security personnel in protecting employees overseas.

In fact, the State Department report noted that the current emergency action plan in Kabul “did not reflect the increased threat in Kabul or the significant growth in staffing levels at Embassy Kabul from 2009 to 2012.”

The Bureau of Counterterrorism’s 2011 country reports on terrorism stated that the number of attacks increased in Afghanistan from 1,122 in 2007 to 2,872 in 2011. In fact, “six of the ten major attacks in Afghanistan during 2011 were in Kabul, two of those attacks were on diplomatic facilities” and a number of hotels frequented by Westerners were attacked.

Concern about embassy security soared after the deadly attack on Sept. 11, 2012, by an al Qaeda affiliate on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. The attack killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three U.S. contractors working in the war-torn region.

James Carafano, a senior defense analyst with the Heritage Foundation, said the systemic failures unmasked by the various inspector general reports must be addressed by a congressional investigation.

“One of the reasons why it was so important to get to the bottom of what happened at Benghazi was not to play political ‘gotcha’ but to understand what went wrong and why so if systemic problems were identified they could be addressed,” Mr. Carafano said.

“We still have not gotten all the answers to the important question, but now we are getting additional information that suggests that there are shortfalls in security at other “high-risk” missions, embassies and consulates so maybe we do have a larger problem here and it is starting to look like the Benghazi-cover-up helped mask these larger issues,” he said.

Questions keep mounting

The Obama administration came under fire from Republican lawmakers after Susan E. Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, went on the Sunday talk shows five days after the Benghazi tragedy and suggested that the attack was a spontaneous riot instigated by an anti-Islamic video distributed on the Internet.

It was discovered later that Stevens had called the State Department for help, the attack was well-organized by the al Qaeda affiliate, and no U.S. military reaction force was summoned to help.

Questions keep mounting about how much the State Department has done to address security vulnerabilities.

The Washington Guardian reported in February that U.S. embassies and diplomatic facilities around the world had exempted themselves from security requirements without the knowledge of senior officials in Washington.

Then in June, the agency’s inspector general warned that failure by State Department officials to adequately protect U.S. diplomats in Beirut left them vulnerable to growing militant groups in the region. At the time of the report, State Department officials had not placed the embassy in Beirut on its latest list of high-threat diplomatic missions even though Lebanon is listed at the “critical” threat level for violence with rocket attacks and small-arms fire from the Syrian civil war.

Shortly after The Washington Times reported on the issue, State Department officials placed Beirut on the high-threat list.

A U.S. military official, who worked in security advisory roles in Iraq and Afghanistan for more than eight years, told The Times that one problem is that the “selection of an embassy facility is sometimes based more on aesthetics than security.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

‘Security is not the emphasis’

During the September 2011 attacks in Kabul, armed Taliban militants fired small arms from the rooftops of high-rise buildings surrounding the embassy. They also targeted the headquarters of NATO’s International Security Assistance Forces, where senior U.S. commanders work and reside. The complex attack also included targeted suicide bombings of police and military checkpoints in the city.

“Many times, security is not the emphasis during the planning process but it’s more of a check-the-block afterthought,” the official said. “Basically, you can’t put an embassy underneath unsecure overhanging structures. In the case of Kabul, they did and according to the IG report the embassy failed on multiple fronts to ensure their employees safety based on what was required by the [emergency action plan]. They were lucky no one died in the embassy attack. “

The official noted that failure to inspect facilities routinely also place employees and U.S. assets at risk.

Mr. Carafano said the State Department cannot use sequester cuts as an excuse not to protect its employees because the department’s security funding was increased “dramatically” after the September attacks in Benghazi.

“The Department of State has been at war with al Qaeda longer than anyone. Since the bombings at the U.S. embassies in Africa in the 1990s, they have had to defend their personnel in some of the most dangerous places on earth. It is incredible to believe that more than a decade after Sept. 11 there are shortfalls in this mission,” Mr. Carafano said.

But the spotlight on Obama’s so-far flaccid performance has obscured a larger reality; the Syria episode has revealed the weakness of multiple institutions and would-be leaders in American life.

That the president and congressional leaders of both parties could be in agreement on a matter of national security — and that much of the country would shrug — is a historic event.

( PHOTOS: Syria: Where politicians stand)

A fair appraisal of losers — lost influence and lost face — in the Syria debacle so far would include the following:

*Political parties

The diminishment of the parties has been underway for years, fueled by the rise of outside groups and politicians who don’t depend on their parties for money and influence. This reality is the main reason Washington has been paralyzed in recent years — neither House Speaker John Boehner nor Obama has any confidence they could bring their own parties along on a deal over the budget, entitlements or other domestic issues.

But the very real possibility that these leaders can’t summon enough followers to produce a majority to authorize force in Syria - particularly in response to something as repugnant as the alleged use of chemical weapons - puts the reality of that weakness in a stark new light.

When George W. Bush asked the Hill to authorize the war in Iraq, only six Republicans in all of Congress voted against his request. On Syria, Obama lost two Democrats – Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tom Udall of New Mexico – in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee alone (in addition, Ed Markey of Massachusetts voted present.)

( WATCH: Obama on Syria, Russia deal & rallying Congress)

It’s a stark illustration of how far party discipline has decayed that a measure supported by Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faces such uncertain prospects for passage. Indeed, party leaders have almost emphasized their lack of leverage in pressing for passage of the White House-backed resolution.

“It’s not a question of whipping. It’s a question of discussing,” Pelosi said last week. After Boehner endorsed the Syria resolution, his spokesman blasted out a statement declaring flatly: “The Speaker expects the White House to provide answers on members’ questions and take the lead on any whipping effort.”

In other words: good luck with all that, Mr. President.

*The mass media

Many millions of Americans will tune into Obama’s speech Tuesday night. Millions more will see it covered in news reports the following day.

Countless others will spend Tuesday evening catching up with the Kardashians or watching the news they really care about, on ESPN or E! News.

The reality for Obama – and his future successors – is that Americans no longer congregate around a small number of outlets for their news and entertainment. A presidential speech that cuts into all the broadcast networks and cable news will reach a big slice of the public, but it won’t command universal interest or attention from the American people.

Historically, presidents have relied heavily on their power to make everyone stop and pay attention. That power has waned and Obama plainly knows it: he has only addressed the nation twice so far from the Oval Office. By comparison, Ronald Reagan gave 34 Oval Office addresses in his presidency and George H. W. Bush gave 12 in his single term, according to presidential historian Martha Kumar.

In his political campaigns, Obama has tried to counteract the fracturing of the media landscape by speaking in unconventional venues for a president – “The Tonight Show” or Men’s Health magazine. For moving mass opinion on a serious matter in a short period of time, that approach has its limits.

“The president in some ways can be overexposed and the value of any one presidential communication is diminished,” said Tevi Troy, the former George W. Bush adviser and author of “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched and Obama tweeted.” Back in the age of FDR’s fireside chats, Troy said, Roosevelt only addressed the nation in that fashion a few times a year: “He actually thought that Churchill spoke too much and lost potency.”

An Algerian jihadist group linked to the Islamic State released a video Wednesday showing a French tourist who was abducted Sunday and beheaded, a U.S. terrorist watchdog group says.

French President Francois Hollande confirmed the killing of Hervé Gourdel, condemning it as a ""cruel and cowardly"" act.

""Our compatriot has been murdered,"" Hollande said before his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.



After seizing Gourdel, 55, a mountaineering guide from Nice, on Sunday, the extremist group Jund al-Khilafah warned that he would be killed within 24 hours unless the French president halted French airstrikes in Iraq against the Islamic State extremist group.

France insisted it would not back down on the attacks.

France was the first U.S. ally to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State but insisted it would target only the extremist forces in Iraq, not Syria.

SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that analyzes and monitors jihadist groups, said Jund al-Khilafah released the beheading video online Wednesday.

The video is titled in French ""A message of blood for the French government."" It shows Gourdel kneeling, his arms tied behind his back, in front of a half-dozen armed and masked men.

Gourdel speaks briefly, expressing love for his family, before one of the militants reads out a speech denouncing ""French criminal crusaders"" against Muslims in Algeria, Mali and Iraq, Agence France-Presse reported.

Gourdel was abducted in the northeast Kabylie region of Algeria, the BBC reported.

The Islamic State, based in regions of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded three Western hostages since August. Two of the victims, James Foley and Steve Sotloff, were U.S. journalists. The third, David Haines, was a British aid worker.

The Islamic State has threatened to behead another British aid worker, Alan Henning.

Americans are among the hostages, the U.S. State Department says

Panetta calls hostage-taking a ""terrorist attack""

Islamists attacked a gas field in eastern Algeria, killing two people and seizing hostages, including Westerners, Algeria's interior minister said Wednesday.

The incident may be linked to France's military support for the government of nearby Mali, according to reports from the region.

The Westerners, accompanied by Algerian security forces, were en route to In Amenas Airport when they were attacked early in the morning by a group of no more than 20 people, the official, Diho Weld Qabliyeh, told Algerian state television. The security forces returned fire, and the attackers withdrew to the base of the petroleum operation, some 3 kilometers away, he said.

Upon arrival at the base, he continued, the attackers ""took in a number of Westerners and Algerians -- some people told us they were nine, some people told us 12.""

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Americans were among the hostages.

Accounts over the number differed.

An Algerian and a Westerner were killed in the attack, and two other Westerners, two of the security forces and two guards from the base were wounded, Qabliyeh said.

A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office, citing the Algerian government, said a British national was among the dead.

With President Mohammed Morsi out of sight and reportedly in military custody , Egypt has begun yet another dangerous new phase in its fitful transition to democracy . The nation is under the temporary leadership of interim President Adly Mansour . He and the military leaders who pushed Morsi from power now face the likelihood that the ousted president 's supporters will — as some promised they would if he was removed from office — fight back .
Mansour , the 67-year-old chief justice of Egypt 's Supreme Constitutional Court , was formally installed in his new role early Thursday . He has been placed in his new post by the country 's military , which on Wednesday removed Morsi from office just one year after he became Egypt 's democratically elected leader . The military says Mansour will serve only until new elections can be held . It has also suspended the nation 's constitution . As we reported Wednesday , President Obama says the U.S. is `` deeply concerned '' about the Egyptian military 's actions , and he called on Egypt 's generals to `` move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government . ''
The coup came after several days of massive , sometimes violent , protests against Morsi 's government . Millions of Egyptians took to the streets to express their anger over the country 's deep economic problems and what they saw as the ineffectiveness of Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood colleagues . It was an ironic fall for the president , who came to power in the wake of equally massive demonstrations in early 2011 that led to the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak 's regime . As NPR 's Greg Myre writes on the Parallels blog , the Arab Spring has become a roiling Arab Summer .
On Morning Edition , NPR Cairo bureau chief Leila Fadel spoke with Heba Morayef , director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch .
`` Morayef says a coup is a dangerous precedent to set , '' Leila reported . `` Some Brotherhood supporters have resorted to violence across the country . As have opponents to the Brotherhood . And the country remains dangerously polarized as the political elite on both sides demonize the other , she says . Opponents to the Brotherhood refer to them as terrorists . Men have been dragged by their beards on the side of the road on suspicion of being in the Brotherhood , Morayef says , fearing that now the military is joining in . ''
Arrest warrants have been issued for at least 300 Muslim Brotherhood leaders . Also on Morning Edition , NPR 's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson said the Egyptian military `` has expressed great concern about keeping the peace and limiting the bloodshed '' as Egyptians react to Wednesday 's coup . `` The fear is that if they do n't ... go after these leaders , a resistance or a backlash will be organized . ''
But , Soraya added , Muslim Brotherhood members say the hunt for their members is a `` return to the enmity of the past , '' when there was a crackdown on the Islamist group by the Mubarak regime .
`` They are still out there '' and taking their concerns to the streets , Soraya said of the Brotherhood 's millions of members . `` The question is , will they stay out there in large numbers '' as the military clamps down ?
We 'll be watching the news from Egypt in coming days . In the meantime , here 's what some other news outlets are saying in their headlines :

8:53 p.m . ET . Military Vows To Protect The Right Of Protest :
Even as Egypt 's military cracks down on the Muslim Brotherhood , it 's vowing to protect the people 's right to protest . Reuters reports :
The Egyptian armed forces said on Thursday they would not take arbitrary measures against any political group and would guarantee the right to protest , as long as demonstrations did not threaten national security .
The military posted a statement to Facebook , promising to avoid any `` exceptional or arbitrary measures against any faction or political current . '' It continued :
`` Peaceful protest and freedom of expression are rights guaranteed to everyone , which Egyptians have earned as one of the most important gains of their glorious revolution . ''
That promise might be put to the test in a few hours ; the Muslim Brotherhood is calling for mass protests on Friday .
4:36 p.m . ET . Egypt Tells Kerry There Was No Military Coup :
Egypt 's Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr says the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi was not a military coup , Reuters reports . Amr spoke with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and foreign ministers of other nations on Thursday , calling Morsi 's removal `` the overwhelming will of the people . ''
Amr , who is serving as interim head of Egypt 's foreign ministry , says the road map for new elections will also honor the people 's will .
`` There is no role , no political role whatsoever , for the military , '' he said . `` This is the total opposite of a military coup . ''
America , Amr underlined , is a strategic partner for Egypt , and Kerry reportedly agreed :
`` Kerry had assured him , Amr said , that Egypt was a strategic ally whose stability was important . Kerry also asked about human rights and the Egyptian minister said there would be no acts of vengeance against Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood . ''
Defining whether what happened was a coup or not is important , as the AP noted earlier this week ; it could affect the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt . It could also trigger economic sanctions .
`` The deposed president is currently in military custody along with 12 of his aides , '' correspondent Merrit Kennedy , who 's in Cairo , tells our Newscast Desk .
An Egyptian security official tells NPR 's Leila Fadel that Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie has been arrested . That mirrors reports from other news outlets , including The Associated Press , which says Badie has been flown to Cairo from a `` resort village in Marsa Matrouh , a Mediterranean coastal city west of Cairo not far from the Libyan border .

Defining whether what happened was a coup or not is important, as the AP noted earlier this week; it could affect the $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt. It could also trigger economic sanctions.

10:55 a.m. ET. Morsi's Aides Also In Custody:

""The deposed president is currently in military custody along with 12 of his aides,"" correspondent Merrit Kennedy, who's in Cairo, tells our Newscast Desk.

10:30 a.m. ET. Reports: Muslim Brotherhood Leader Arrested:

An Egyptian security official tells NPR's Leila Fadel that Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie has been arrested. That mirrors reports from other news outlets, including The Associated Press, which says Badie has been flown to Cairo from a ""resort village in Marsa Matrouh, a Mediterranean coastal city west of Cairo not far from the Libyan border.""

That witness is Mark I. Thompson , a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for operations in the agency ’ s counterterrorism bureau . Sources tell ███ Thompson will level the allegation against Clinton during testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif .
███ has also learned that another official from the counterterrorism bureau -- independently of Thompson -- voiced the same complaint about Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to trusted national security colleagues back in October .
Extremists linked to Al Qaeda stormed the U.S. Consulate and a nearby annex on Sept. 11 , in a heavily armed and well-coordinated eight-hour assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya , Chris Stevens , and three other Americans .
Thompson considers himself a whistle-blower whose account was suppressed by the official investigative panel that Clinton convened to review the episode , the Accountability Review Board ( ARB ) . Thompson 's lawyer , Joseph diGenova , a former U.S. attorney , has further alleged that his client has been subjected to threats and intimidation by as-yet-unnamed superiors at State , in advance of his cooperation with Congress .
Sources close to the congressional investigation who have been briefed on what Thompson will testify tell ███ the veteran counterterrorism official concluded on Sept. 11 that Clinton and Kennedy tried to cut the counterterrorism bureau out of the loop as they and other Obama administration officials weighed how to respond to -- and characterize -- the Benghazi attacks .
`` You should have seen what ( Clinton ) tried to do to us that night , '' the second official in State 's counterterrorism bureau told colleagues back in October . Those comments would appear to be corroborated by Thompson 's forthcoming testimony .
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the counterterrorism officials ' allegation `` 100 percent false . '' A spokesman for Clinton said tersely that the charge is not true .
Daniel Benjamin , who ran the department 's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time , also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges .
`` I ran the bureau then , and I can say now with certainty , as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism , that this charge is simply untrue , '' he said . `` Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack , I was in frequent contact with the Department . At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of . ''
He went on to call his bureau a `` central participant in the interagency discussion about the longer-term response to Benghazi . '' He said `` at no time was the Bureau sidelined or otherwise kept from carrying out its tasks . ''
Documents from the State Department , the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council , first published in the May 13 edition of `` The Weekly Standard , '' showed that senior officials from those agencies decided within days of the attacks to delete all references to Al Qaeda 's known involvement in them from `` talking points '' being prepared for those administration officers being sent out to discuss the attacks publicly .
Those talking points -- and indeed , the statements of all senior Obama administration officials who commented publicly on Benghazi during the early days after the attacks -- sought instead to depict the Americans ' deaths as the result of a spontaneous protest that went awry . The administration later acknowledged that there had been no such protest , as evidence mounted that Al Qaeda-linked terrorists had participated in the attacks . The latter conclusion had figured prominently in the earliest CIA drafts of the talking points , but was stricken by an ad hoc group of senior officials controlling the drafting process . Among those involved in prodding the deletions , the documents published by `` The Weekly Standard '' show , was State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland , who wrote at one point that the revisions were not sufficient to satisfy `` my building 's leadership . ''
The allegations of the two counterterrorism officials stand to return the former secretary of state to the center of the Benghazi story . Widely regarded as a leading potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 , Clinton has insisted she was not privy to decisions made by underlings about the inadequate security for the U.S. installations in Benghazi that were made in the run-up to the attacks . And she has portrayed her role -- once the attacks became known in Washington -- as that of a determined fact-finder who worked with colleagues to fashion the best possible response to the crisis .
Clinton testified about Benghazi for the first and only time in January of this year , shortly before leaving office . She had long delayed her testimony , at first because she cited the need for the ARB to complete its report , and then because she suffered a series of untimely health problems that included a stomach virus , a concussion sustained during a fall at home , and a blood clot near her brain , from which she has since recovered . However , Clinton was never interviewed by the ARB she convened .
███ disclosed last week that the conduct of the ARB is itself now under review by the State Department 's Office of Inspector General . A department spokesman said the OIG probe is examining all prior ARBs , not just the one established after Benghazi .
The two U.S. officials -- former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and former Ambassador Tom Pickering -- who oversaw the internal review of the attacks defended their report .
`` From the beginning of the ARB process , we had unfettered access to everyone and everything including all the documentation we needed . Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened , and that 's what we did , '' they said in a statement Monday .
The counterterrorism officials , however , concluded that Clinton and Kennedy were immediately wary of the attacks being portrayed as acts of terrorism , and accordingly worked to prevent the counterterrorism bureau from having a role in the department 's early decision-making relating to them .
Also appearing before the oversight committee on Wednesday will be Gregory N. Hicks , the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks . Like Thompson , Hicks is a career State Department official who considers himself a Benghazi whistle-blower . His attorney , Victoria Toensing , a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee , has charged that Hicks , too , has faced threats of reprisal from unnamed superiors at State . ( Toensing and diGenova , who are representing their respective clients pro bono , are married . )
Portions of the forthcoming testimony of Hicks -- who was one of the last people to speak to Stevens , and who upon the ambassador 's death became the senior U.S. diplomat in Libya -- were made public by Rep. Issa during an appearance on the CBS News program `` Face the Nation '' on Sunday .
Hicks told the committee that he and his colleagues on the ground in Libya that night knew instantly that Benghazi was a terrorist attack , and that he was astonished that no one drafting the administration 's talking points consulted with him before finalizing them , or before U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice delivered them on the Sunday talk shows of Sept. 16 .

Iran has vowed `` harsh retaliation '' for the U.S. airstrike near Baghdad 's airport that killed Tehran 's top general and the architect of its interventions across the Middle East , as tensions soared in the wake of the targeted killing . ( AP Photo/Anmar Khalil )
BEIRUT ( AP ) — The latest on U.S.-Iran tensions ( all times local ) :
Residents of the Iraq ’ s capital of Baghdad say three explosions rang out heard inside the heavily-fortified Green Zone , home to the U.S. Embassy and the seat of Iraq ’ s government .
This is was the second such attack in recent days .
Alert sirens were sounded Sunday in the area on the west bank of the Tigris river .
There was no immediate confirmation from authorities but the explosions were believed to have been from mortars or rockets that struck the area .
The strikes come after top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad . His killing has escalated the crisis between Iran and the U.S .
Turkey ’ s president called for de-escalation between Iran and the U.S. following America ’ s killing of an Iranian general . He says the slaying of a top commander will likely not go unanswered , and voiced concern about regional security risks .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s first public comments on the killing came in a televised interview Sunday . He says he was surprised because the strike occurred just hours after a phone call with President Donald Trump .
Erdogan said he “ especially had suggested to ( Trump ) that tensions with Iran should not be heightened ” during that call .
Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani ’ s killing in a drone strike in Baghdad has escalated the crisis between Iran and the U.S .
Tehran has since abandoned all limits of its 2015 nuclear deal , and Iraq ’ s parliament called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil .
Iranian state television reports that Iran will no longer abide by any of the limits of its 2015 nuclear deal .
The announcement came Sunday night after another Iranian official said it would consider taking even-harsher steps over the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Friday in Baghdad .
It ’ s unclear what this means for the program , especially when it comes to enrichment of uranium . Authorities did not immediately elaborate .
A former leader of Iran ’ s Revolutionary Guard says the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa can be targeted to avenge a general killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad .
Mohsen Rezaee made the comment Sunday in Tehran at a ceremony in honor of the slain leader Qassem Soleimani .
He has previously alleged Israel somehow leaked information about Soleimani ’ s whereabouts to U.S. forces , who killed him Friday in a drone strike .
The U.S-led coalition in Iraq says it is pausing operations in support of Iraqi forces in the fight against Islamic State militants .
The coalition says it ’ s focus will now be on protecting U.S. personnel and bases in Iraq , and it is suspending training for Iraqi forces .
The coalition ’ s decision Sunday comes days after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran ’ s top commander in Baghdad .
The killing has heightened tensions in the region and tested the U.S.-Iraq alliance . Attacks on bases that house U.S. forces are expected to increase .
Iraqi lawmakers also voted Sunday in favor of a new bill that calls for the expulsion of all 5,000 US troops from Iraq .
Iraq ’ s parliament has voted to expel the U.S. military from the country .
Lawmakers voted Sunday in favor of a resolution that calls for ending foreign military presence in the country . The resolution ’ s main aim is to get the U.S. to withdraw some 5,000 U.S. troops present in different parts of Iraq .
The vote comes two days after a U.S. airstrike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani inside Iraq , dramatically increasing regional tensions .
The Iraqi resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group .
The resolution was backed by most Shiite members of parliament , who hold a majority of seats .
Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session , apparently because they oppose abolishing the deal .
The leader of Lebanon ’ s Hezbollah group says America ’ s military in the Middle East region , including U.S. bases , warships and soldiers are fair targets following the U.S. killing of Iran ’ s top general .
Hassan Nasrallah says evicting U.S. military forces from the region is now a priority .
The U.S. military , which recently killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani “ will pay the price , ” he added in a speech Sunday .
“ The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased , ” Nasrallah added .
Pope Francis is calling for dialogue and self-restraint in his first public comments amid soaring tensions between the U.S. and Iran , after a U.S. airstrike killed Iran ’ s top general in Iraq .
During his Sunday noon blessing , Francis warned : “ War brings only death and destruction. ” He led the tens of thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter ’ s Square in a silent prayer for peace .
Speaking off the cuff , Francis said : “ I call on all side to keep alive the flame of dialogue and self-control , and to avoid the shadows of enmity . ”
Francis had hoped to visit Iraq this year to minister to the Christian minorities that have been targeted by the Islamic State group . Vatican officials and local Catholic bishops in Iraq have voiced concern about the impact of any new conflict on the weakest and most marginal in Iraq .
Iraq ’ s parliament has begun an emergency session and will likely vote on a resolution requiring the government to ask foreign forces to leave Iraq .
The resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group .
The resolution is backed by most Shiite members of parliament , who hold a majority of seats .

BEIRUT (AP) — The latest on U.S.-Iran tensions (all times local):

9:50 p.m.

Residents of the Iraq’s capital of Baghdad say three explosions rang out heard inside the heavily-fortified Green Zone, home to the U.S. Embassy and the seat of Iraq’s government.

This is was the second such attack in recent days.

Alert sirens were sounded Sunday in the area on the west bank of the Tigris river.

There was no immediate confirmation from authorities but the explosions were believed to have been from mortars or rockets that struck the area.

The strikes come after top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. His killing has escalated the crisis between Iran and the U.S.

___

9:20 p.m.

Turkey’s president called for de-escalation between Iran and the U.S. following America’s killing of an Iranian general. He says the slaying of a top commander will likely not go unanswered, and voiced concern about regional security risks.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s first public comments on the killing came in a televised interview Sunday. He says he was surprised because the strike occurred just hours after a phone call with President Donald Trump.

Erdogan said he “especially had suggested to (Trump) that tensions with Iran should not be heightened” during that call.

Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani’s killing in a drone strike in Baghdad has escalated the crisis between Iran and the U.S.

Tehran has since abandoned all limits of its 2015 nuclear deal, and Iraq’s parliament called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil.

Turkey shares a border with Iran, Iraq and Syria.

___

8:05 p.m.

Iranian state television reports that Iran will no longer abide by any of the limits of its 2015 nuclear deal.

The announcement came Sunday night after another Iranian official said it would consider taking even-harsher steps over the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Friday in Baghdad.

It’s unclear what this means for the program, especially when it comes to enrichment of uranium. Authorities did not immediately elaborate.

___

6:30 p.m.

A former leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard says the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa can be targeted to avenge a general killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

Mohsen Rezaee made the comment Sunday in Tehran at a ceremony in honor of the slain leader Qassem Soleimani.

He has previously alleged Israel somehow leaked information about Soleimani’s whereabouts to U.S. forces, who killed him Friday in a drone strike.

Israel and Iran are longtime foes.

5:50 p.m.

The U.S-led coalition in Iraq says it is pausing operations in support of Iraqi forces in the fight against Islamic State militants.

The coalition says it’s focus will now be on protecting U.S. personnel and bases in Iraq, and it is suspending training for Iraqi forces.

The coalition’s decision Sunday comes days after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s top commander in Baghdad.

The killing has heightened tensions in the region and tested the U.S.-Iraq alliance. Attacks on bases that house U.S. forces are expected to increase.

Iraqi lawmakers also voted Sunday in favor of a new bill that calls for the expulsion of all 5,000 US troops from Iraq.

___

4:45 p.m.

Iraq’s parliament has voted to expel the U.S. military from the country.

Lawmakers voted Sunday in favor of a resolution that calls for ending foreign military presence in the country. The resolution’s main aim is to get the U.S. to withdraw some 5,000 U.S. troops present in different parts of Iraq.

The vote comes two days after a U.S. airstrike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani inside Iraq, dramatically increasing regional tensions.

The Iraqi resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group.

The resolution was backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats.

Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session, apparently because they oppose abolishing the deal.

4:20 p.m.

The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group says America’s military in the Middle East region, including U.S. bases, warships and soldiers are fair targets following the U.S. killing of Iran’s top general.

Hassan Nasrallah says evicting U.S. military forces from the region is now a priority.

The U.S. military, which recently killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani “will pay the price,” he added in a speech Sunday.

“The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased,” Nasrallah added.

4:10 p.m.

Pope Francis is calling for dialogue and self-restraint in his first public comments amid soaring tensions between the U.S. and Iran, after a U.S. airstrike killed Iran’s top general in Iraq.

During his Sunday noon blessing, Francis warned: “War brings only death and destruction.” He led the tens of thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square in a silent prayer for peace.

Speaking off the cuff, Francis said: “I call on all side to keep alive the flame of dialogue and self-control, and to avoid the shadows of enmity.”

Francis had hoped to visit Iraq this year to minister to the Christian minorities that have been targeted by the Islamic State group. Vatican officials and local Catholic bishops in Iraq have voiced concern about the impact of any new conflict on the weakest and most marginal in Iraq.

___

3:55 p.m.

Iraq’s parliament has begun an emergency session and will likely vote on a resolution requiring the government to ask foreign forces to leave Iraq.

The resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group.

The resolution is backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats.

The request was put forward Sunday by the largest bloc in the legislature, known as Fatah. That bloc includes leaders associated with the Iran-backed paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units, which were a major force in the fight against IS.

But a growing dragnet picked up dozens more Brothers today , illustrating the difficulty they will have resisting the decision .
Reuters reports that security forces fanned out across Cairo and other cities today . An overnight clash between Brotherhood backers and opponents left one person dead , Agence France-Presse reports , and police used tear gas from police to break up the fighting .
The country has been in turmoil since massive protests against Muslim Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsi culminated in a military takeover in July . The government has gradually tightened the screws on the group , banning it in September and imprisoning thousands of members and supporters , including several top leaders . Wednesday 's terrorist designation gives security forces new tools to squeeze the organization , including stiffer jail terms and even the possibility of death penalties for some leaders .
Ahmed Imam , a spokesman for a political party founded by ex-Brotherhood member Abdel-Moneim Abolfotoh , warned that the terrorism designation `` leaves the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters only one choice , which is violence , '' The Associated Press reports .

Muslim Brotherhood supporters have vowed to defy the Egyptian government's decision to designate the group a terrorist organization and all the restrictions that come along with the classification. But a growing dragnet picked up dozens more Brothers today, illustrating the difficulty they will have resisting the decision.

Reuters reports that security forces fanned out across Cairo and other cities today. An overnight clash between Brotherhood backers and opponents left one person dead, Agence France-Presse reports, and police used tear gas from police to break up the fighting.

The country has been in turmoil since massive protests against Muslim Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsi culminated in a military takeover in July. The government has gradually tightened the screws on the group, banning it in September and imprisoning thousands of members and supporters, including several top leaders. Wednesday's terrorist designation gives security forces new tools to squeeze the organization, including stiffer jail terms and even the possibility of death penalties for some leaders.

Ahmed Imam, a spokesman for a political party founded by ex-Brotherhood member Abdel-Moneim Abolfotoh, warned that the terrorism designation ""leaves the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters only one choice, which is violence,"" The Associated Press reports.

On Thursday, a public bus bombing in Cairo wounded five people in an attack that was notable for targeting something other than a police or military site. Two days earlier, a suicide bomber detonated outside a police building in a Nile Delta town north of Cairo, killing 15 people. The Brotherhood denied involvement in the attacks.

President Trump ’ s administration indicated that the strikes , which saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at Syria ’ s Shayrat airbase near Homs , were linked only to the chemical weapons attack Tuesday that killed at least 86 people , including 27 children , in Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib Province .
And while they may have chastened Mr. Assad , analysts say , they do not appear to signal a broader change of US policy on Syria that would pose a longer-term threat to his hold on power .
“ This [ missile attack ] clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for , ” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters late Thursday . `` I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today . There has been no change in that status . ”
Those comments might offer some reassurance to Assad that the air strikes were more a slap on the wrist than the beginning of a knockout blow . And with the war in Syria slowly turning in his favor – and with his two key allies , Russia and Iran , continuing to stand by him – Assad looks likely to stay in power , a reality that Syria ’ s neighbors and the international community reluctantly have had to accept .
“ We should not invest the limited American military attack with any strategic connotations so far , ” says Fawaz Gerges , a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics ( LSE ) . “ It ’ s an attack divorced from any strategic political vision . It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration has any concrete ideas to find a political solution . I ’ m very skeptical . ”
Mr. Gerges warns , however , that military action on its own , absent a strategy , is inherently hard to contain , and could lead to an unintended deepening of US military involvement if Russia and Iran redouble their support for Assad even as Syrian rebels try to use the US strikes as leverage .
“ This administration is enamored with hard power , ” says Gerges , author of the book , “ ISIS : A History. ” But “ without soft power – without diplomacy , and a political strategy – military actions might be counter-productive . ”
Julien Barnes-Dacey , a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations , warns that the strikes ’ ability to trigger an escalation derives from the region ’ s very different perceptions of US military power , including fears in Syria and Iran that the ultimate objective could become regime change .
“ Obviously , Trump has framed this through a narrow proliferation lens , and the attacks were very limited . But I don ’ t think anyone else on the ground or internationally is going to see them through that same narrow lens , ” says Mr. Barnes-Dacey , speaking from Brussels .
“ For [ Syria ’ s ] opposition and its backers , there ’ s long been a sense that once you get US skin in the game , an escalatory cycle will quickly take over . ”
Whether or not the retaliatory strikes have any impact on Assad ’ s hold on power , his survival after six years of war has come at an increasing cost . Assad took office in 2000 on the death of his father , Hafez , and hopes were initially invested in him as a reformer who would modernize the ossified police state he inherited .
Seventeen years later , Assad has achieved an international pariah status unseen since the days of Iraq ’ s Saddam Hussein . His country has been devastated , the economy ruined , an estimated more than 400,000 people are dead , and the conflict has created the largest refugee crisis Europe has witnessed since World War II .
His regime controls only about 35 percent of Syria , with the rest carved up between various Arab and Kurdish militias and the extremist Islamic State group ( ISIS ) . He stands accused of employing chemical nerve agents against his own population and executing tens of thousands of people in regime prisons . Even if the war subsides and thoughts turn to rebuilding , it is difficult to see which countries or what global institutions would be willing to bankroll a multi-billion dollar reconstruction process with Assad still enthroned in the presidential palace .
“ Maybe Bashar will stay for some time now , but eventually , sooner or later [ he will go ] , nothing stays the same in this region , ” Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said recently , speaking to a group of foreign reporters . Mr. Hariri ’ s father , Rafik , was assassinated in 2005 , with Assad ’ s Syria widely believed to have been involved .
“ It would be foolish to think that this regime is still in control in Syria , ” Hariri adds . “ The people who are in control in Syria are the Russians and the Iranians . ”
Moscow , meanwhile , has reacted angrily to the air strikes , calling them an “ aggression against a sovereign nation ” and announcing an end to the de-confliction mechanism set up between Washington and Moscow to prevent accidental clashes between US and Russian aircraft over Syria , where both nations fly ostensibly on “ anti-terror ” missions against ISIS .
The Pentagon alerted Russia before it launched the cruise missile attack , as well as NATO allies Turkey and Britain , and the Russian forces do not appear to have activated their S-300 and S-400 air defense systems , which could have intercepted some of the cruise missiles .
“ There was an effort to minimize risk to third party nationals at the airport – I think you can read Russians from that . We took great pains to try to avoid that , ” Trump ’ s national security adviser , Lt. Gen. H.R . McMaster , told reporters .

It remains to be seen whether the missile strike against the air base is a one-off response to the use of nerve agents or whether the Trump administration will repeat such operations anytime Syrian government forces inflict mass civilian casualties , whether with chemical weapons or conventional means .
Military action “ would not likely reverse the tide of the conflict against Assad , ” says Mr. Hof . “ But it could be significant enough to teach Assad that mass civilian casualty events will no longer be cost-free . This would be important , because as long as civilians are on the bullseye , there can be no meaningful or productive peace negotiations . ”","The US has launched its first punitive military strikes against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria since the civil war there began six years ago, a powerful message that Washington will no longer tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population.

President Trump’s administration indicated that the strikes, which saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at Syria’s Shayrat airbase near Homs, were linked only to the chemical weapons attack Tuesday that killed at least 86 people, including 27 children, in Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib Province.

And while they may have chastened Mr. Assad, analysts say, they do not appear to signal a broader change of US policy on Syria that would pose a longer-term threat to his hold on power.

“This [missile attack] clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters late Thursday. ""I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There has been no change in that status.”

Those comments might offer some reassurance to Assad that the air strikes were more a slap on the wrist than the beginning of a knockout blow. And with the war in Syria slowly turning in his favor – and with his two key allies, Russia and Iran, continuing to stand by him – Assad looks likely to stay in power, a reality that Syria’s neighbors and the international community reluctantly have had to accept.

“We should not invest the limited American military attack with any strategic connotations so far,” says Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics (LSE). “It’s an attack divorced from any strategic political vision. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration has any concrete ideas to find a political solution. I’m very skeptical.”

Mr. Gerges warns, however, that military action on its own, absent a strategy, is inherently hard to contain, and could lead to an unintended deepening of US military involvement if Russia and Iran redouble their support for Assad even as Syrian rebels try to use the US strikes as leverage.

“This administration is enamored with hard power,” says Gerges, author of the book, “ISIS: A History.” But “without soft power – without diplomacy, and a political strategy – military actions might be counter-productive.”

Julien Barnes-Dacey, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, warns that the strikes’ ability to trigger an escalation derives from the region’s very different perceptions of US military power, including fears in Syria and Iran that the ultimate objective could become regime change.

“Obviously, Trump has framed this through a narrow proliferation lens, and the attacks were very limited. But I don’t think anyone else on the ground or internationally is going to see them through that same narrow lens,” says Mr. Barnes-Dacey, speaking from Brussels.

“For [Syria’s] opposition and its backers, there’s long been a sense that once you get US skin in the game, an escalatory cycle will quickly take over.”

Cost of Assad's rule

Whether or not the retaliatory strikes have any impact on Assad’s hold on power, his survival after six years of war has come at an increasing cost. Assad took office in 2000 on the death of his father, Hafez, and hopes were initially invested in him as a reformer who would modernize the ossified police state he inherited.

Seventeen years later, Assad has achieved an international pariah status unseen since the days of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein. His country has been devastated, the economy ruined, an estimated more than 400,000 people are dead, and the conflict has created the largest refugee crisis Europe has witnessed since World War II.

His regime controls only about 35 percent of Syria, with the rest carved up between various Arab and Kurdish militias and the extremist Islamic State group (ISIS). He stands accused of employing chemical nerve agents against his own population and executing tens of thousands of people in regime prisons. Even if the war subsides and thoughts turn to rebuilding, it is difficult to see which countries or what global institutions would be willing to bankroll a multi-billion dollar reconstruction process with Assad still enthroned in the presidential palace.

“Maybe Bashar will stay for some time now, but eventually, sooner or later [he will go], nothing stays the same in this region,” Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said recently, speaking to a group of foreign reporters. Mr. Hariri’s father, Rafik, was assassinated in 2005, with Assad’s Syria widely believed to have been involved.

“It would be foolish to think that this regime is still in control in Syria,” Hariri adds. “The people who are in control in Syria are the Russians and the Iranians.”

Russia holds its fire

Moscow, meanwhile, has reacted angrily to the air strikes, calling them an “aggression against a sovereign nation” and announcing an end to the de-confliction mechanism set up between Washington and Moscow to prevent accidental clashes between US and Russian aircraft over Syria, where both nations fly ostensibly on “anti-terror” missions against ISIS.

The Pentagon alerted Russia before it launched the cruise missile attack, as well as NATO allies Turkey and Britain, and the Russian forces do not appear to have activated their S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, which could have intercepted some of the cruise missiles.

“There was an effort to minimize risk to third party nationals at the airport – I think you can read Russians from that. We took great pains to try to avoid that,” Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, told reporters.

The Pentagon’s target, meanwhile, an operational air base, is seen as having a negligible impact on Assad’s ability to continue waging war. Initial accounts of the attack suggest that aircraft and hangars were destroyed and the runway rendered inoperable.

Assad’s real military weakness, however, is not a lack of aircraft but insufficient ground forces to battle rebel groups, which is why his regime has had to rely on allies such as Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and Shiite paramilitary forces from Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia’s contribution to the Assad war effort has been mainly air support, and Moscow could deploy more aircraft to Syria if needed to plug any shortfall caused by US bombing.

On Thursday, Assad was quoted as repeating his determination to claw back the entire country, telling a Croatian newspaper that there was no “option except victory.”

“If we do not win this war, it means that Syria will be deleted from the map,” he told Vecernji List newspaper. “We have no choice in facing this war, and that’s why we are confident, we are persistent, and we are determined.”

Why chemical weapons?

Assad’s critical manpower shortage may be a reason the regime allegedly opted for chemical weapons in Idlib, analysts say.

“Assad doesn’t have anywhere close to the men to retake his territory, that’s why he’s using chemical weapons,” says Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This [US strike] is a clear message he will not be able to gas his way over the two-thirds of Syrian territory outside his control.”

President Barack Obama would put strikes against Syria on hold if Bashar Assad ’ s regime were to turn over control of its chemical weapons , he said Monday , as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that he will wait to hear the president make his case to the nation Tuesday before holding an initial vote on military action .
The moves came at the tail end of a tumultuous day for a White House that appeared to be knocked off-message by Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s positive response to a question about whether the administration would consider a proposal that would allow Syria to avoid a military strike by turning over any stockpile of chemical weapons .
Obama said he ’ s open to — though skeptical of — a potential deal to transfer control of Assad ’ s weapons . “ Absolutely . If in fact that happens , ” Obama said in an interview with ABC , one of six he sat for at the White House on Monday .
The president said his team will engage in talks with Russia and Syria . “ We ’ re going to run this to ground , ” he told CNN . “ And John Kerry and the rest of my national security team will engage with the Russians and the international community to see can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious . ”
These talks , he said in multiple interviews , could be a “ breakthrough , ” but he said the administration must move ahead skeptically . “ We don ’ t want just a a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on their right now , ” he told NBC .
Though the plan seemed to emerge Monday after Kerry , the secretary of state , mentioned the idea early in the day , Obama said the idea of having Russia intervene to try to get Syria to turn over control of its chemical weapons has been on the table for more than a year .
“ This is not new , ” he told Fox News . “ I ’ ve been discussing this with President Putin for some time now , ” he said , including conversations at last year ’ s G-20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico , and more recently . “ I did have those conversations ” last week at the G-2o in St. Petersburg , Russia , he told PBS .
Obama ’ s interviews — with ABC ’ s Diane Sawyer , CBS ’ s Scott Pelley , CNN ’ s Wolf Blitzer , Fox News ’ s Chris Wallace , NBC ’ s Savannah Guthrie and PBS ’ s Gwen Ifill — capped off a day of remarks in support of a Syria strike from high-profile surrogates including Kerry , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and National Security Adviser Susan Rice , as well as Rice deputies Tony Blinken and Ben Rhodes .
The interviews also came as the White House continued its outreach to members of Congress , bringing more than 70 to the West Wing on Monday , including most of the Congressional Black Caucus .
Obama had initially anticipated broad congressional support for a strike and said as much in remarks as recently as late last week , but conceded Monday that support isn ’ t strong . “ I wouldn ’ t say I ’ m confident ” that Congress will authorize action , he told NBC .
Just as Obama ’ s interviews began to air at 6 p.m . ET , Reid announced that he would hold off on filing cloture until after the president ’ s speech to the nation , which is set for Tuesday at 9 p.m . ET .
“ I don ’ t think we need to see how fast we can do this . We have to see how well we can do this , ” Reid ( D-Nev. ) told senators . “ What we need to do is make sure that the president has the opportunity to speak to all 100 senators all 300 million people before we do this . ”
Reid said he consulted with the president before making his decision .
The move could mean the first procedural vote will occur as late as Thursday without GOP cooperation . But Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) could strike an agreement to have a vote earlier , possibly Wednesday , when Reid had earlier predicted the first vote would come .
Obama said he hasn ’ t decided whether he would go ahead with a strike if Congress voted against it .
“ I think it ’ s fair to say that I haven ’ t decided . I am taking this vote in Congress and what the American people are saying very seriously , ” he said .
If an agreement to avert a military attack can ’ t be reached , Obama acknowledged that in addition to swaying members of Congress , he also needs to convince the American people — and even some in his own household — that action is necessary .
“ I knew by bringing this to Congress that there was a risk that the American people , you know , just could not arrive at a consensus around even a limited strike . Because if you ask somebody , you know , I read polls like everybody else , ” he told NBC . “ And if you ask somebody , if you ask Michelle , ‘ Do we do we want to be involved in another war ? ’ The answer is no . ”
Early Monday , Kerry suggested a potential solution , which Russia and Syria quickly seized on . “ He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week .

One of odder ones was the sight of hundreds of lobbyists from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee fanning out on Capitol Hill to lobby members of the House and Senate to support Obama 's plan to launch what Secretary of State John Kerry called `` unbelievably small '' air strikes against empty regime controlled buildings in Syria .
AIPAC officials claimed they were doing this because the air strikes would help Israel .
But this claim was easily undone . Obama and Kerry insisted nothing the US would do would have any impact on the outcome of the Syrian civil war . This was supposed to be the strikes ' selling point . But by launching worthless strikes , Obama was poised to wreck America 's deterrent posture , transforming the world 's superpower into an international joke .
In harming America 's deterrent capabilities by speaking loudly and carrying an `` unbelievably small '' stick , Kerry and Obama also harmed Israel 's deterrent posture .
Israel 's deterrence relies in no small measure on its strategic alliance with the US .
Once the US is no longer feared , a key part of Israeli deterrence is removed .
Obama did not announce his intention to bomb empty buildings in Syria in order to impact the deterrent posture of either the US or Israel . He probably gave them little thought . The only one who stood to gain from those strikes - aside from Syrian President Bashar Assad who would earn bragging rights for standing down the US military - was Obama himself .
Obama wanted to launch the unbelievably small strikes to prove that he was n't lying when he said that Syria would cross a red line if it used chemical weapons .
So if the strikes were going to harm the US and Israel , why did AIPAC dispatch its lobbyists to Capitol Hill to lobby in favor of them ?
Obama ordered AIPAC to go to Capitol Hill to lobby for the Syria strikes . He did so knowing that its involvement would weaken public support for AIPAC and Israel . Both would be widely perceived as pushing the US to send military forces into harm 's way to defend Israel .
Then , with hundreds of AIPAC lobbyist racing from one Congressional office to the next , Obama left them in a lurch . He announced he was cutting a deal with Russia and had decided not to attack Syria after all .
What did AIPAC get for its self-defeating efforts on Obama 's behalf ?
Obama is now courting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the hopes of making a deal that Iran will use as cover for completing its nuclear weapons program . Such a deal may well involve ending sanctions on Iran 's oil exports and its central bank - sanctions that AIPAC expended years of effort getting Congress to pass .
And that 's not all . Monday , as Obama meets with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly in New York , Vice President Joe Biden will become the highest ranking administration official to date to address the J Street conference .
J Street was formed in order to weaken AIPAC , and force it to the left . Sending Biden to headline at the J Street conference is an act of aggression against AIPAC . It also signals that Obama remains committed to strengthening the anti-Israel voices at the margins of the American Jewish community at the expense of the pro- Israel majority .
The question is why is AIPAC cooperating with Obama as he abuses it ? Why did n't they just say no ?
AIPAC is not strong enough to stand up to the president of the United States , particularly one as hostile as Obama .
Not only would it have suffered direct retaliation for its refusal , Obama would have also punished Israel for its friend 's recalcitrance .
In a recent interview with The Times of Israel , Eitan Haber , late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin 's closest aide , made the case that Israel is powerless in the face of White House pressure . Haber claimed that only when a person becomes prime minister does he understand `` to what extent the State of Israel is dependent on America . For absolutely everything ... we are dependent on America . ''
Haber noted that the US can collapse every aspect of Israel . From this he concluded that no Israeli leader can stand up to Washington .
Haber recalled a menacing conversation Rabin had with then-US secretary of state James Baker during which Baker became angry at Rabin .
`` America is right even when it is wrong , '' Baker admonished the Israeli leader .
Haber warned that Israel can not stand up to the US even when the US is behaving in a manner that endangers Israel . `` It 's possible that they do n't understand the region and that they are naïve and stupid , '' he said , `` But they are America . ''
Haber was right that that the White House can destroy Israel 's economy , defenses and diplomatic position any time it wishes . In the past administration threats of economic sanctions or delays in sending spare parts for weapons platforms have been sufficient to make Israeli leaders fall into line .
For the past five and a half years Obama has dangled US diplomatic support at the UN Security Council over Israel 's head like the Sword of Damocles .
Obama forced Netanyahu to make concession after concession to secure his veto of the PLO 's request that the UN Security Council accept `` Palestine '' as a member state two years ago . Netanyahu 's sudden support for Palestinian statehood and his 10- month long freeze on Jewish property rights in Judea and Samaria were the most public concessions he was forced to cough up .
The timing of the EU announcement that it was barring EU entities from forging ties with Israelis that operate beyond the 1949 armistice lines was revealing in this context . The EU announced its economic sanctions the day Kerry announced the start of negotiations between Israel and the PLO . The message to Israel was absolutely clear : Do what we order you to or you will face economic sanctions far more damaging .
Obama 's appointment of Samantha Power to serve as US ambassador to the UN was another signal of ill intent . Power became the object of fear and fury for Israel supporters after YouTube videos of a 2002 interview she gave went viral during the 2008 elections . In that interview Power called for the US to send `` a mammoth protection force '' to Israel to protect the Palestinians from `` genocide '' that Israel would commit . That is , she called for the US to go to war against Israel to protect the Palestinians from a nonexistent threat maliciously attributed to the only human rights-respecting state in the Middle East .
And just after his reelection , Obama sent Power to the epicenter of international blood libels and attempts to outlaw the Jewish state .
Obama 's deal with Russia President Vladimir Putin was also a signal of aggression , if not an act of aggression in and of itself . The ink had barely dried on their unenforceable agreement that leaves Iran 's Arab client in power , when Putin turned his guns on Israel . As Putin put it , Syria only developed its chemical arsenal `` as an alternative to the nuclear weapons of Israel . ''
The Obama administration itself has a track record in putting Israel 's presumptive nuclear arsenal on the international diplomatic chopping block . In 2010 Netanyahu was compelled to cancel his participation in Obama 's nuclear weapons conference when he learned that Egypt and Turkey intended to use Obama 's conference to demand that Israel sign the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty .
Obama 's behavior demonstrates his bad intentions . So Israelis and our American supporters need to ask whether Haber is right . Is Israel powerless in the face of a hostile US administration ?
Let 's reconsider Obama 's decision to turn to AIPAC for support on Syria .
Why did he do that ? Why did he turn to an organization he wishes to harm and order it to go to the mattresses for him ?
Obama turned to AIPAC primarily because AIPAC could help him . AIPAC hold sway on Capitol Hill .
Where does that power come from ? Does AIPAC wield influence because it frightens members into submission ?
AIPAC is powerful because it serves as a mouthpiece for the overwhelming majority of Americans . The American people support Israel . If something will help Israel , then most Americans will support it . Obama wanted Congressional support . He could n't win it on the merits of his feckless plan . So he sent in AIPAC to pretend that his strikes would benefit Israel .
Obama 's demand that AIPAC help him is reality 's response to Haber 's protestations of Israeli powerlessness .
Israel 's alliance with the US , upon which it is so dependent , was not built with America 's political or foreign policy elites . Saudi Arabia 's alliance with the US was built on such ties .
Israel 's alliance with the US is built on the American public 's support for Israel . And although Obama himself does n't need to face American voters again , his Democratic colleagues do . Moreover , even lame duck presidents can not veer too far away from the national consensus .
It is because of this consensus that Obama has to send signals to Israel - like the EU sanctions , and Power 's appointment to the UN - rather than openly part ways with Jerusalem .
Obama is powerful . And he threatens Israel . But Israel is not as powerless as Haber believes . Israel can make its case to the American public .
And assuming the American people support Israel 's case , Obama 's freedom of action can be constrained .
For instance , on the Palestinian issue , Haber said Israel has to accept whatever Obama says . But that is n't true . Netanyahu can set out the international legal basis for Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria and explain why Israel 's rights are stronger than the Palestinians ' .
The government can expose the fact that the demographic doomsday scenario that forms the basis of support for the two-state formula is grounded on falsified data concocted by the PLO .
Demography , like international law , is actually one of Israel 's strategic assets .
Were Netanyahu to defy Obama and order the IDF to attack Iran 's nuclear installations , he would be pushing the boundaries of the US political consensus less than Menachem Begin did when he ordered the air force to destroy Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 . He would also be pushing the US consensus less than Rabin did when he embraced Yasser Arafat in 1993 .
No , Israel can not say no to everything that Obama wishes to do in the Middle East .
And yes , it needs to make concessions where it can to placate the White House . AIPAC 's decision to take a bullet for Obama on Syria may have been the better part of wisdom .
Israel has three-and-a-half more years with Obama . They wo n't be easy . And there is no telling who will succeed him . But this need n't be a catastrophe . Our cards are limited . But we have cards . And if we play them wisely , we will be fine .","US President Barack Obama's rapidly changing positions on Syria have produced many odd spectacles.

One of odder ones was the sight of hundreds of lobbyists from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee fanning out on Capitol Hill to lobby members of the House and Senate to support Obama's plan to launch what Secretary of State John Kerry called ""unbelievably small"" air strikes against empty regime controlled buildings in Syria.

AIPAC officials claimed they were doing this because the air strikes would help Israel.

But this claim was easily undone. Obama and Kerry insisted nothing the US would do would have any impact on the outcome of the Syrian civil war. This was supposed to be the strikes' selling point. But by launching worthless strikes, Obama was poised to wreck America's deterrent posture, transforming the world's superpower into an international joke.

In harming America's deterrent capabilities by speaking loudly and carrying an ""unbelievably small"" stick, Kerry and Obama also harmed Israel's deterrent posture.

Israel's deterrence relies in no small measure on its strategic alliance with the US.

Once the US is no longer feared, a key part of Israeli deterrence is removed.

Obama did not announce his intention to bomb empty buildings in Syria in order to impact the deterrent posture of either the US or Israel. He probably gave them little thought. The only one who stood to gain from those strikes - aside from Syrian President Bashar Assad who would earn bragging rights for standing down the US military - was Obama himself.

Obama wanted to launch the unbelievably small strikes to prove that he wasn't lying when he said that Syria would cross a red line if it used chemical weapons.

So if the strikes were going to harm the US and Israel, why did AIPAC dispatch its lobbyists to Capitol Hill to lobby in favor of them?

Because Obama made them.

Obama ordered AIPAC to go to Capitol Hill to lobby for the Syria strikes. He did so knowing that its involvement would weaken public support for AIPAC and Israel. Both would be widely perceived as pushing the US to send military forces into harm's way to defend Israel.

Then, with hundreds of AIPAC lobbyist racing from one Congressional office to the next, Obama left them in a lurch. He announced he was cutting a deal with Russia and had decided not to attack Syria after all.

What did AIPAC get for its self-defeating efforts on Obama's behalf?

Obama is now courting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the hopes of making a deal that Iran will use as cover for completing its nuclear weapons program. Such a deal may well involve ending sanctions on Iran's oil exports and its central bank - sanctions that AIPAC expended years of effort getting Congress to pass.

And that's not all. Monday, as Obama meets with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly in New York, Vice President Joe Biden will become the highest ranking administration official to date to address the J Street conference.

J Street was formed in order to weaken AIPAC, and force it to the left. Sending Biden to headline at the J Street conference is an act of aggression against AIPAC. It also signals that Obama remains committed to strengthening the anti-Israel voices at the margins of the American Jewish community at the expense of the pro- Israel majority.

The question is why is AIPAC cooperating with Obama as he abuses it? Why didn't they just say no?

Because they couldn't.

AIPAC is not strong enough to stand up to the president of the United States, particularly one as hostile as Obama.

Not only would it have suffered direct retaliation for its refusal, Obama would have also punished Israel for its friend's recalcitrance.

In a recent interview with The Times of Israel, Eitan Haber, late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's closest aide, made the case that Israel is powerless in the face of White House pressure. Haber claimed that only when a person becomes prime minister does he understand ""to what extent the State of Israel is dependent on America. For absolutely everything... we are dependent on America.""

Haber noted that the US can collapse every aspect of Israel. From this he concluded that no Israeli leader can stand up to Washington.

Haber recalled a menacing conversation Rabin had with then-US secretary of state James Baker during which Baker became angry at Rabin.

""America is right even when it is wrong,"" Baker admonished the Israeli leader.

Haber warned that Israel cannot stand up to the US even when the US is behaving in a manner that endangers Israel. ""It's possible that they don't understand the region and that they are naïve and stupid,"" he said, ""But they are America.""

Haber was right that that the White House can destroy Israel's economy, defenses and diplomatic position any time it wishes. In the past administration threats of economic sanctions or delays in sending spare parts for weapons platforms have been sufficient to make Israeli leaders fall into line.

For the past five and a half years Obama has dangled US diplomatic support at the UN Security Council over Israel's head like the Sword of Damocles.

Netanyahu's sudden support for Palestinian statehood and his 10- month long freeze on Jewish property rights in Judea and Samaria were the most public concessions he was forced to cough up.

The timing of the EU announcement that it was barring EU entities from forging ties with Israelis that operate beyond the 1949 armistice lines was revealing in this context. The EU announced its economic sanctions the day Kerry announced the start of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The message to Israel was absolutely clear: Do what we order you to or you will face economic sanctions far more damaging.

But a closer look at members of Congress criticizing the White House deal with the Iranians shows it isn't just Republicans who are concerned about being frozen out of the process. A number of Democrats have also voiced their concerns. In fact, Democrats in the Senate are so skeptical of the White House refusal to involve Congress that Republican Bob Corker may have enough votes to override a deal should the President sign one at the end of June.

Regardless of bipartisan opposition, the White House is pinning opposition and criticism of the current deal and process on Republicans. The administration is painting Republican concerns as illegitimate while at the same time entertaining the same concerns of ""principled"" Democrats.

""My view is that there are a number of members of Congress that have considered this in a principled way. And those are members of Congress with whom we can have legitimate conversations about our efforts to try and prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" Earnest said Monday afternoon. ""There are a substantial number of members of Congress, all of them Republicans as far as I can tell, who have engaged in an effort to just undermine the talks from the very beginning.""

An outrageous ransom demand . A failed rescue attempt . A taunting e-mail .
These were the details emerging about the final months of the life of American journalist James Foley , whose execution at the hands of Islamic extremists was captured on video and posted online this week as a warning to the United States .
Foley 's captors demanded 100 million euros ( $ 132.5 million ) in exchange for his release , according to an official with GlobalPost , the U.S.-based online publication the freelance journalist was working for at the time of his abduction in Syria in 2012 .
GlobalPost `` never took the 100 million seriously '' because ransoms paid for other hostages being held by ISIS , which refers to itself as the Islamic State , were `` dramatically less , '' Philip Balboni , president and chief executive of the news agency , told CNN .

There was an effort to raise money . But there was never any true negotiation between the news outlet and Foley 's captors , Balboni stressed , saying that ISIS simply made demands .
Foley , 40 , was last seen on November 22 , 2012 , in northwest Syria , near the border with Turkey .

The classified order directing the Central Intelligence Agency to coordinate arming the rebels in concert with its allies reverses a long-standing policy that limited the U.S. to providing nonlethal support .
The White House declined to comment on the authorization , saying only that Mr. Obama had decided to ramp up `` military support '' to moderate rebels both in `` scope and scale . ''
U.S. officials also told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the U.S. military proposal for arming the rebels also calls for a limited no-fly zone inside Syria that would be enforced by U.S. and allied planes on Jordanian territory to protect Syrian refugees and rebels who would train there .
Such a move , if the White House goes ahead , would represent a significantly bigger U.S. engagement in Syria 's civil war .
Syria in the Spotlight Track the latest events in a map , see the key players and a chronology of the unrest .
The developments followed a series of high level meetings at the White House and consultations with allies in which officials discussed the intelligence findings and proposals for arming the rebels .
U.S. officials said the issue divided Mr. Obama 's national security team but that the administration faced little choice other than to step up its support or risk watching as rebels lose still more ground to a resurgent Assad regime backed by Russia , Iran and soldiers from the militant Hezbollah group .
Rebels requested specific weapons to hold off Mr. Assad 's forces and Hezbollah fighters who are closing in on rebel positions in the city of Aleppo , the Journal reported Wednesday . The head of Syria 's opposition Supreme Military Council , or SMC , issued a plea to U.S. officials and others for arms .
Ben Rhodes , the White House Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications , said the U.S. has concluded that forces loyal to the Syrian regime have used chemical weapons against rebels , resulting in up to 150 deaths .
The U.S. determination came the same day the United Nations reported that the number of deaths in the 27-month conflict has surpassed 90,000 .
The assessment on chemical weapons was based in part on laboratory analysis of physical samples taken from Syria , Mr. Rhodes said . He referred to the use of chemical weapons as a `` red line '' and said it has changed Mr. Obama 's calculus about U.S. involvement in the conflict .
In April , the White House notified Congress that U.S. intelligence agencies believed with `` varying degrees of confidence '' that Mr. Assad 's forces had used chemical weapons , including sarin gas , in limited quantities .
In the two months that followed , the U.S. came under heavy pressure from allies Britain and France to make a clear-cut determination . While U.S. officials initially voiced doubts , Britain and France said early on that they were more certain chemical weapons had been used .
On Thursday , Mr. Rhodes said the U.S. now `` has high confidence in that assessment given multiple , independent streams of information . ''
The U.S. findings about chemical-weapons use were shared with Russia , part of a U.S. effort to get Moscow to cut support to Mr. Assad . The U.S. ramp-up will be a key issue at a gathering of leaders of the Group of 8 leading countries in Ireland next week .
Mr. Rhodes highlighted four instances in which the U.S. believes chemical weapons were used : on March 19 in the Aleppo suburb of Khan Al-Asal ; April 13 in the Aleppo neighborhood of Sheikh Maksud ; May 14 , in Qasr Abu Samra , which is north of Homs ; and on May 23 in an attack in eastern Damascus .
Officials said the White House has yet to decide what types of arms the U.S. will provide to the rebels . The rebels have asked for antitank missiles and antiaircraft weapons known as Manpads , as well as for large amounts of ammunition for small arms .
U.S. officials have made clear the White House is unlikely to provide Manpads to the rebels because of concerns they could be turned against civilian aircraft . But the U.S. has n't ruled out providing antitank weapons and small arms . Officials say European allies have expressed a willingness to provide Manpads and potentially other heavier weapons sought by rebels .
`` The red line has been crossed and now we are going to go ahead with arming the opposition , '' a senior U.S. official said .
The move is an about-face by Mr. Obama , who last year blocked a proposal backed by then-Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to arm the rebels . At the time , Mr. Obama voiced concerns that arms could end up in the hands of Islamists battling Mr. Assad .
But administration officials who favored providing arms said the White House believes it has a clearer picture today of the opposition and confidence that sufficient safeguards can be put in place to prevent U.S. weapons from reaching Islamist fighters aligned with al Qaeda .
More important , officials say , the White House was moved by concerns that Mr. Assad 's forces and thousands of Hezbollah fighters may be poised for an assault on Aleppo that would deal such a serious blow to moderate rebel forces that it will be hard for them to regroup and bounce back .
U.S. officials say weapons and training will likely be delivered to the rebels inside Jordan , a key ally that has been overwhelmed by a flood of refugees from Syria and has offered the U.S. use of its bases to help set up a safe zone along the Syrian border .
U.S. military planners , responding to a request by the White House to develop options for Syria , recommended the limited no-fly zone along the Syrian border to protect rebels and refugees inside Jordan .
The plan would create what one official called a `` no fighting zone '' that would stretch up to 25 miles into Syrian territory along the Jordanian border , preventing Mr. Assad 's forces from launching attacks against the rebels and refugees and protecting U.S. personnel involved in distributing weapons and providing training .
Under this plan , the U.S. and its allies would enforce the zone using aircraft flown from Jordanian bases and flying inside the kingdom , according to U.S. officials .
Jordan has been inundated by a flood of refugees that Jordanian and U.S. officials say is a growing threat to the kingdom , a key U.S. ally in the region .
The U.S. has already moved Patriot air defense batteries and F-16 fighter planes to Jordan , which could be integral to any no-fly zone if Mr. Obama approves the military proposal .
Proponents of the proposal think a no-fly zone could be imposed without a U.N. Security Council resolution , since the U.S. would not regularly enter Syrian airspace and would n't hold Syrian territory .
U.S. planes have air-to-air missiles that could destroy Syrian planes from long ranges . But officials said that aircraft may be required to enter Syrian air space if threatened by advancing Syrian planes . Such an incursion by the U.S. , if it were to happen , could be justified as self-defense , officials say .
Creating even a limited buffer zone that Syrian airplanes can not enter will be expensive , costing an estimated $ 50 million a day , officials said .
Republican lawmakers were quick to praise the increase in aid .
Sens . Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona said in a joint statement : `` The president 's red line has been crossed . U.S. credibility is on the line . Now is not the time to merely take the next incremental step . Now is the time for more decisive actions .

Under this plan, the U.S. and its allies would enforce the zone using aircraft flown from Jordanian bases and flying inside the kingdom, according to U.S. officials.

Jordan has been inundated by a flood of refugees that Jordanian and U.S. officials say is a growing threat to the kingdom, a key U.S. ally in the region.

The U.S. has already moved Patriot air defense batteries and F-16 fighter planes to Jordan, which could be integral to any no-fly zone if Mr. Obama approves the military proposal.

Proponents of the proposal think a no-fly zone could be imposed without a U.N. Security Council resolution, since the U.S. would not regularly enter Syrian airspace and wouldn't hold Syrian territory.

U.S. planes have air-to-air missiles that could destroy Syrian planes from long ranges. But officials said that aircraft may be required to enter Syrian air space if threatened by advancing Syrian planes. Such an incursion by the U.S., if it were to happen, could be justified as self-defense, officials say.

Creating even a limited buffer zone that Syrian airplanes cannot enter will be expensive, costing an estimated $50 million a day, officials said.

Republican lawmakers were quick to praise the increase in aid.

Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona said in a joint statement: ""The president's red line has been crossed. U.S. credibility is on the line. Now is not the time to merely take the next incremental step. Now is the time for more decisive actions.""

Sanctions 'target people, not politicians'

By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian service

The Iranians seem divided on social media. The tag #thankyoutrump has been used by those who are supportive of the US president's decision to leave the nuclear deal with Iran.

Those who are happy are from different groups. They include the hardline anti-American opponents of President Rouhani, plus the people that are against the regime who say the deal hasn't benefited them.

And then there are those in the middle, those who do want change but are not sure that sanctions will accelerate that. They sound disappointed. They accuse the US of being deceptive and dishonest. They say the sanctions will target the people not the politicians.

How do key powers see Mr Trump's decision?

Mr Macron said France - ""along with our partners"" - was looking to prevent tensions escalating in the region.

""I regret the decision of the American president. I think it's a mistake and that's why we Europeans have decided to remain in the nuclear agreement,"" he told German broadcaster ARD.

In earlier comments, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there"".

He said there would be a meeting between France, Britain, Germany and Iran on Monday.

Russia said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Mr Trump's decision, while China and Germany expressed regret.

But the move has been welcomed by Iran's major regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Saudi Arabia signalled on Wednesday that it would look to acquire its own nuclear weapons if Iran does.

""We have made it very clear that if Iran acquires a nuclear capability, we'll do everything we can to do the same,"" foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told CNN.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a prominent critic of the accord, said he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal.

Why did the US withdraw?

In his address on Tuesday, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".

Mr Trump alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of the terms of the deal.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who on Wednesday again said Iran was honouring its commitments.

These include:

limiting the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons

limiting the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium

modifying a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb

But Mr Trump said: ""It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.""

He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East.

He also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.

Cairo ( CNN ) -- Egypt 's military toppled the country 's first democratically elected president Wednesday night and reportedly put him under house arrest while rounding up some of his top supporters even as the deposed Mohamed Morsy insisted that he remains the country 's legitimate leader .
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Egypt over the military 's actions that were decried by Morsy 's supporters as a `` coup '' and celebrated as a `` correction '' by his opponents . At least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in sporadic violence that at times pitted Morsy 's supporters against the opposition and the military .
Morsy `` did not achieve the goals of the people '' and failed to meet the generals ' demands that he share power with his opposition , Egypt 's top military officer , Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi , said in a televised speech to the nation .
Adly Mansour , head of the country 's Supreme Constitutional Court , will replace Morsy as Egypt 's interim president , El-Sisi said . Mansour was expected to be sworn in on Thursday .
The military has not publicly commented on Morsy 's whereabouts . But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN the deposed president was under `` house arrest '' at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo . He said some members of Morsy 's inner circle have also put under house arrest .
The country 's constitution has been suspended , and Mansour will `` establish a government that is a strong and diverse , '' said El-Sisi , head of the country 's armed forces . New parliamentary elections will be held , and Mansour will have the power to issue constitutional declarations in the meantime , he said .
El-Sisi said the military was fulfilling its `` historic responsibility '' to protect the country by ousting Morsy , a Western-educated Islamist elected a year ago .
Morsy remained defiant and insisted he was Egypt 's proper president .
`` The world is looking at us today , '' he said in a taped statement delivered to the Arabic satellite network Al Jazeera . `` We by ourselves can bypass the obstacles . We , the sons of Egypt , the sons of this country -- this is the will of the people and can not be canceled . ''
Shortly after Morsy 's statement aired , Al Jazeera reported its Cairo studios were raided during a live broadcast on Wednesday and its presenter , guests and producers arrested .
The Muslim Brotherhood , the long-repressed political movement that propelled Morsy to office , said its broadcast outlets had been shut down .
The state-run Middle East News Agency said the two top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood 's political party had been taken into custody , and another state-run outlet , the newspaper Al-Ahram , said another 300 were being sought by police .
El-Haddad told CNN that he has been told hundreds of names have been put on an `` arrest list '' but could n't confirm any arrests beyond those of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party chief , Saad el-Katatni , and its deputy , Rashad Al-Bayoumi .
Morsy said he remains open to negotiations and dialogue , and he called on supporters to demonstrate peacefully .
But at least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in clashes around the country on Wednesday , Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Mustafa Hamid told Al-Ahram .
Morsy opponents who packed Tahrir Square , now the epicenter of two Egyptian upheavals , erupted in jubilation and fireworks when El-Sisi made his announcement .
`` This is a united people of Egypt , '' anti-Morsy organizer Ahmed el Hawary said . `` Mohamed Morsy has actually succeeded in uniting the people , after two years that we were totally against each other ... Mohamed Morsy , with his bad management , with his risking all the lives of Egypt , brought all Egyptians back together to be facing again their future , hand in hand . ''
But Abdoul Mawgoud Dardery , a former member of parliament from the Morsy-allied Freedom and Justice Party , called that `` ridiculous . ''
`` I do n't know how can anyone with common sense support a military coup in a democracy , '' he said . Egyptians `` will never recognize a coup d'etat , '' he said .
And across the Nile River from Tahrir Square , Morsy supporters chanted chanted `` Down with military rule '' and `` The square has a million martyrs . ''
Before Wednesday night 's announcement , troops moved into key positions around the capital , closing off a bridge over the Nile and surrounding Rabaa Adawya Square , where Morsy 's supporters were gathered .
Morsy was elected president in June 2012 . But his approval ratings have plummeted as his government has failed to keep order or revive Egypt 's economy . The chaos , including open sexual assaults on women in Egypt 's streets , has driven away tourists and investors , while opponents say Morsy 's rule was increasingly authoritarian .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a leading opposition figure , said the plans announced Wednesday were `` a correction for the way of the revolution '' that drove Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011 .
`` The road map guarantees achieving the principal demand of the Egyptian people -- having early presidential elections through an interim period through which the constitution will be amended , '' he said . `` So all of us build it together and agree on a democratic constitution , so we can guarantee our freedoms .

The Egyptian military dominated the country for six decades and took direct power for a year and a half after Mubarak 's ouster . On Monday , after a previous demand that Morsy offer concessions to the opposition , it gave him 48 hours to order reforms .

Morsy was elected president in June 2012. But his approval ratings have plummeted as his government has failed to keep order or revive Egypt's economy. The chaos, including open sexual assaults on women in Egypt's streets, has driven away tourists and investors, while opponents say Morsy's rule was increasingly authoritarian.

Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a leading opposition figure, said the plans announced Wednesday were ""a correction for the way of the revolution"" that drove Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011.

Obama says U.S. reviewing aid

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the United States is ""deeply concerned"" by Morsy's removal and the suspension of the constitution.

Washington has supplied Egypt's military with tens of billions in support and equipment over more than 30 years, and under U.S. law, that support could be cut off after a coup -- a term his White House statement avoided.

""The United States does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the rule of law,"" Obama said.

He said he had ordered ""the relevant departments and agencies"" to study what American law would mean for U.S. aid and urged the generals to hand power back to an elected government 'as soon as possible.""

In the wake of Morsy's ouster, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed Obama's call for an immediate return to civilian rule. He appealed for ""calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint.""

Wednesday's events capped days of massive demonstrations for and against Morsy. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but health officials said 23 people died in clashes overnight at Cairo University, Al-Ahram reported.

Anti-Morsy demonstrators have ransacked Muslim Brotherhood offices around Egypt in the past several days.

Obama called Morsy on Monday to urge him to take a less-rigid stance toward his opponents, telling his Egyptian counterpart ""that democracy is about more than elections,"" a White House statement said. But the State Department denied that Obama had urged Morsy to call early elections, as a senior administration official had said Tuesday.

Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy

Morsy's opposition said it had collected more than 20 million signatures on a petition to remove him -- millions more than the number who voted Morsy into the presidency.

And faced with the throngs that filled Cairo's Tahrir Square, ""the military had to intervene. Otherwise this crowd was going to get Morsy from his palace.""

CNN spells the deposed president's name with a 'y' in accordance with what his spokesman said is his personal preference, his own e-mail and the country's Foreign Ministry.

Embarrassing the U.S.

Removing all references to al Qaeda from the talking points and sending Mrs. Rice on TV to blame the attack on the video embarrassed the United States, Mr. Hicks said.

Mrs. Rice was directly confronted on CBS’ “Face the Nation” five days after the attacks with videotape of the president of the Libyan National Congress, Mohamad Yusef al-Magariaf.

Mr. al-Magariaf called the attacks “pre-planned.”

“Based on the best information we have to date,” Mrs. Rice responded, the attack “began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction” to protests against the video.

“We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or pre-planned,” she said.

But there isn ’ t enough proof to try them in a U.S. civilian court as the Obama administration prefers .
The men remain at large while the FBI gathers evidence . But the investigation has been slowed by the reduced U.S. intelligence presence in the region since the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attacks , and by the limited ability to assist by Libya ’ s post-revolutionary law enforcement and intelligence agencies , which are still in their infancy since the overthrow of dictator Col. Moammar Gadhafi .
The decision not to seize the men militarily underscores the White House aim to move away from hunting terrorists as enemy combatants and holding them at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . The preference is toward a process in which most are apprehended and tried by the countries where they are living or arrested by the U.S. with the host country ’ s cooperation and tried in the U.S. criminal justice system . Using military force to detain the men might also harm fledgling relations with Libya and other post-Arab-Spring governments with whom the U.S. is trying to build partnerships to hunt al-Qaida as the organization expands throughout the region .
A senior administration official said the FBI has identified a number of individuals that it believes have information or may have been involved , and is considering options to bring those responsible to justice . But taking action in remote eastern Libya would be difficult . America ’ s relationship with Libya would be weighed as part of those options , the official said , speaking only on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the effort publicly .
The Libyan Embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment .
Waiting to prosecute suspects instead of grabbing them now could add to the political weight the Benghazi case already carries . The attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans weeks before President Barack Obama ’ s re-election . Since then , Republicans in Congress have condemned the administration ’ s handling of the situation , criticizing the level of embassy security , questioning the talking points provided to U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice for her public appearances to explain the attack and suggesting the White House tried to play down the incident to minimize its effect on the president ’ s campaign .
The FBI released photos of three of the five suspects earlier this month , asking the public to provide more information on the men pictured . The images were captured by security cameras at the U.S. diplomatic post during the attack , but it took weeks for the FBI to see and study them . It took the agency three weeks to get to Libya because of security problems , so Libyan officials had to get the cameras and send them to U.S. officials in Tripoli , the capital .
The FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies identified the men through contacts in Libya and by monitoring their communications . They are thought to be members of Ansar al-Shariah , the Libyan militia group whose fighters were seen near the U.S. diplomatic facility prior to the violence .
Republican lawmakers continue to call for the Obama administration to provide more information about the attack . The White House released 99 pages of emails about the talking points drafted by the intelligence community that Rice used to describe the attack , initially suggesting they were part of a series of regional protests about an anti-Islamic film . In those emails , administration officials agreed to remove from the talking points all mentions of terror groups such as Ansar al-Shariah or al-Qaida , because the intelligence pointing to those groups ’ involvement was still unclear and because some officials didn ’ t want to give Congress ammunition to criticize the administration .
U.S. officials say the FBI has proof that the five men were either at the scene of the first attack or somehow involved because of intercepts of at least one of them bragging about taking part . Some of the men have also been in contact with a network of well-known regional Jihadists , including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb .
The U.S. has decided that the evidence it has now would be enough for a military operation to seize the men for questioning , but not enough for a civilian arrest or a drone strike against them , the officials said . The U.S. has kept them under surveillance , mostly by electronic means . There was a worry that the men could get spooked and hide , but so far , not even the FBI ’ s release of surveillance video stills has done that .
FBI investigators are hoping for more evidence , such as other video of the attack that might show the suspects in the act of setting the fires that ultimately killed the ambassador and his communications specialist , or firing the mortars hours later at the CIA base where the surviving diplomats took shelter — or a Libyan witness willing to testify against the suspects in a U.S. courtroom .
Administration officials have indicated recently that the FBI is zeroing in .
“ Regardless of what happened previously , we have made very , very , very substantial progress in that investigation , ” Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers last week .
That echoed comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry to lawmakers last month .
“ They do have people ID ’ d , ” Kerry said of the FBI-led investigation . “ They have made some progress . They have a number of suspects who are persons of interest that they are pursuing in this and building cases on . ”
But options for dealing with the men are few and difficult , U.S. officials said , describing high level strategy debates among White House , FBI and other counterterror officials . Those confidential discussions were described on condition of anonymity by four senior U.S. officials briefed on the investigation into the attack .
The U.S. could ask Libya to arrest the suspects , hoping that Americans would be given access to question them and that the Libyans gather enough evidence to hold the men under their own justice system . Another option is to ask the Libyans to extradite the men to the U.S. , but that would require the U.S. to gather enough solid evidence linking the suspects to the crime to ask for such an action .
Asking other countries to detain suspects hasn ’ t produced much thus far . In this case , the Egyptian government detained Egyptian Islamic Jihad member Muhammad Jamal Abu Ahmad for possible links to the attack , but it remains unclear if U.S. intelligence officers were ever allowed to question him .
Tunisia allowed the U.S. to question Tunisian suspect Ali Harzi , 28 , who was arrested in Turkey last October because of suspected links to the Sept. 11 Benghazi attack , but a judge released him in January for lack of evidence .
Finally , the U.S. could send a military team to grab the men , and take them to an offsite location such as a U.S. naval ship — the same way al-Qaida suspect Ahmed Warsame was seized by special operations personnel in 2011 in Somalia . He was then held and questioned for two months on a U.S. ship before being read his Miranda rights , transferred to the custody of the FBI and taken for trial in a New York court . Warsame pleaded guilty earlier this year and agreed to tell the FBI what he knew about terror threats and , if necessary , testify for the government .
The U.S. has made preparations for raids to grab the Benghazi suspects for interrogation in case the administration decides that ’ s the best option , officials said . Such raids could be legally justified under the U.S. law passed just after the 9/11 terror attacks that authorizes the use of military force against al-Qaida , officials said . The reach of the law has been expanded to include groups working with al-Qaida .
The option most likely off the table would be taking suspects seized by the military to Guantanamo Bay , the facility in Cuba that Obama has said he wants to close .
“ Just as the administration is trying to find the exit ramp for Guantanamo is not the time to be adding to it , ” said Morris Davis , the former chief prosecutor for Guantánamo .
Beyond being politically uncomfortable , it ’ s less effective , he said . “ There ’ ve been a total of seven cases completed since 2001 , ” with six of them landing in appeals court over issues with the legitimacy of the charges .","The U.S. has identified five men who might be responsible for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last year, and has enough evidence to justify seizing them by military force as suspected terrorists, officials say.

A bipartisan Senate report chastises the State Department for security failures leading up to the Sept. 11 assault in Benghazi — the second investigation in two weeks to fault Foggy Bottom for inadequate protections in Libya that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador.

The congressional probe also found that even though intelligence showed from the start that terrorists were responsible, the Obama administration was inconsistent in its public remarks about the nature of the assault, which “contributed to the confusion in the public discourse after the attack about exactly what happened.”

The 31-page report, released Monday and obtained early by POLITICO, was led by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), the top members of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.

Collins said “too often” the State Department did not adequately respond to pleas for more security — such as more personnel — from officials at the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Sometimes, requests for more security went ignored, according to Collins.

“Our investigation found that the terrorists essentially walked right into the Benghazi compound unimpeded and set it ablaze, due to extremely poor security in a threat environment that was ‘flashing red’ in the words of a high-ranking official,” Collins said in a statement.

The report found a “large amount of evidence” from intelligence officials that Benghazi was “increasingly dangerous and unstable” and that the risk of a “significant attack” against U.S. officials there was becoming “much more likely.” That information was shared with State Department officials, but no “commensurate increase in security” was granted, according to the report.

Classified intelligence indicated a “rapidly deteriorating threat environment” in Libya, which should have prodded officials in Washington to increase security levels there, the report found.

The diplomatic mission’s “temporary” status left it even more vulnerable to security failures, because it was difficult to establish standard procedures and secure adequate money for security upgrades, according to the report.

With Tuesday's deadline for an international deal on Iran's nuclear program approaching, foreign ministers from Iran and six world powers are trying to hash out an agreement. The debate currently centers on where Iran's nuclear fuel should be stored, and how — and when — economic sanctions should be lifted.

Other details, such as rules controlling enrichment, the length of the deal and how it would be enforced, also remain unsettled.

Late Sunday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state media that Iran won't agree to ship even part of its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country. A U.S. State Department official tells NPR's Peter Kenyon that Araqchi's position isn't new.

From Lausanne, Switzerland, Peter reports for our Newscast unit:

""The U.S. and its allies want to reduce Iran's stockpile from more than 17,000 pounds down to a few hundred, and shipping some of it out has come up. But a senior State Department official says there are other ways of solving that problem. ""If the sides can agree on the major elements of a deal here, they'll have three months to hammer out the technical details of a final accord.""

As the deadline nears, Peter says, analysts believe that comments like Araqchi's could be an attempt to gain last-minute concessions in an agreement.

Iran is currently under economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the European Union and the United States. The question of whether an agreement would trigger removal of all those hindrances at once or whether they would be phased out is a key issue in the talks.

In Europe and the U.S., economic and political considerations could offer further complications to a potential deal.

As Bloomberg News reports, ""Trade between Europe and Iran has plunged to about $9 billion from almost $32 billion in 2005 when sanctions began to be tightened.""

And as we've reported, many U.S. Republicans oppose any potential easing of sanctions on Iran, even taking the extraordinary step of writing to the country's supreme leader about the nuclear talks.

middle_east,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/6/8561215/bashar-al-assad-is-losing-ground-in-syria,Bashar al-Assad is losing ground in Syria,2015-05-06,"Zack Beauchamp, Alissa Wilkinson, Ian Millhiser, Jason Del Rey, Hannah Brown, Jen Kirby","For most of the past two years , it looked like Bashar al-Assad 's campaign to hold on in Syria was working . Syria 's weak , uncoordinated , and increasingly Islamist rebels were being gradually pushed back . And while ISIS had seized vast parts of the country , it and Assad appeared to tolerate one another in a sort of tacit non-aggression pact designed to crush the Syrian rebels . It seemed that Syria , and the world , would be stuck with Assad 's murderous dictatorship for the foreseeable future .
But in the past few weeks , things appear to have changed — potentially dramatically . The rebels have won a string of significant victories in the country 's north . Assad 's troop reserves are wearing thin , and it 's becoming harder for him to replace his losses .
A rebel victory , to be clear , is far from imminent or even likely . At this point , it 's too early to say for sure what this means for the course of the Syrian war . But the rebels have found a new momentum against Assad just as his military strength could be weakening , which could be a significant change in the trajectory of a war that has been ongoing for years .
Bashar al-Assad 's forces are losing ground against the rebels , for example in northern Idlib province , where two recent rebel victories show how strong the rebels have gotten . First , in late March , Assad 's forces were pushed out of Idlib City , the region 's capital . Second , in late April , rebels took Jisr al-Shughour , a strategically valuable town that lies on the Assad regime 's supply line in the area and near its important coastal holdings .
`` Jisr al-Shughour is a good example of how the regime is , indeed , losing ground , '' Noah Bonsey , a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group , told me . `` Most observers were surprised at how quickly it fell , given that it is a town of some strategic importance . ''
While rebels ' most dramatic victories are in Idlib , they 're advancing elsewhere as well . They 've seized towns in the south and have repelled Assad offensives around the country .
`` Losses in Idlib and the southern governorate of Deraa have placed great pressure on Assad , '' Charles Lister , a fellow at the Brookings Doha Center , writes . `` Frustration , disaffection and even incidences of protest are rising across Assad ’ s most ardent areas of support on Syria ’ s coast — some of which are now under direct attack . ''
Bonsey concurs . `` Rebels have seized momentum in recent weeks and months , '' he says . `` The regime is clearly weakening to an extent that was not widely reflected in the English-language narrative surrounding the conflict . ''
Recent regime defeats reflect growing unity among the rebels as well as fundamental weaknesses on the regime 's side .
The Idlib advance , in particular , was led by Jaish al-Fatah , a new rebel coalition led by several different Islamist groups . While the coalition includes Jabhat al-Nusra , al-Qaeda 's Syrian franchise , the jihadis do n't appear to dominate the group .
`` The operations also displayed a far improved level of coordination between rival factions , '' Lister writes , `` spanning from U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) brigades , to moderate and conservative Syrian Islamists , to al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and several independent jihadist factions . ''
Rebel coordination is nothing new in Syria . But this coalition stands out for its size and breadth .
`` The number of fighters mobilized for the initial Idlib city campaign has been significant , and that 's been just as true in subsequent operations in the north , '' Bonsey says . `` The level of coordination we 've seen over several weeks , on multiple fronts , is something that we have rarely , if ever , seen from rebels in the north . ''
And as the rebels have gotten more united , the regime has gotten weaker . The basic problem is attrition : Assad is losing a lot of soldiers in this war , and his regime — a sectarian Shia government in an overwhelmingly Sunni country — ca n't train replacements quickly enough .
Bonsey calls this an `` unsolvable manpower problem . '' As a result , he says , Assad is becoming increasingly dependent on his foreign allies — Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah specifically — to lead the ground campaign .
But Iran has shown limited willingness to commit heavily to areas like Idlib , and rather is concentrating principally on defending the regime 's core holdings around Damascus and the coast . According to Bonsey , `` it 's a matter of priorities , '' which is to say that their resources are n't unlimited , and they 've ( so far ) preferred to concentrate them in the most critical areas .
Iran 's involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Yemen on top of Syria has left it `` really overstretched , '' according to Daveed Gartenstein-Ross , a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies . The cumulative resource investment has `` certainly had an impact on Assad losing territory in Syria , '' he concludes .
`` For the regime , the status quo militarily is not sustainable , '' Bonsey says , and `` Iran 's strategy in Syria does not appear sustainable . The costs to Iran of propping up Assad 's rule in Syria are only going to rise with time , substantially . And what 's happened with Idlib in recent weeks is only the latest indication of that . ''
Bonsey , like most Syria experts , does not believe Assad is on the road to inevitable defeat .
`` While much of the subsequent commentary [ to the Idlib offensive ] proclaimed this as the beginning of the end for President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime , we are still a long way from that , '' Lister writes .
For one thing , Iran sees the survival of the Assad regime as a critical strategic priority , as it allows Iran to supply Hezbollah and maintain a close ally in the Levant .

The `` big question now , '' according to Bonsey , is `` how the regime and its backers choose to respond to these defeats . '' A major decider , in other words , is Iran . But as long as they see protecting the Assad regime as vital , they are likely to do what it takes to keep his core territory intact .","For most of the past two years, it looked like Bashar al-Assad's campaign to hold on in Syria was working. Syria's weak, uncoordinated, and increasingly Islamist rebels were being gradually pushed back. And while ISIS had seized vast parts of the country, it and Assad appeared to tolerate one another in a sort of tacit non-aggression pact designed to crush the Syrian rebels. It seemed that Syria, and the world, would be stuck with Assad's murderous dictatorship for the foreseeable future.

But in the past few weeks, things appear to have changed — potentially dramatically. The rebels have won a string of significant victories in the country's north. Assad's troop reserves are wearing thin, and it's becoming harder for him to replace his losses.

A rebel victory, to be clear, is far from imminent or even likely. At this point, it's too early to say for sure what this means for the course of the Syrian war. But the rebels have found a new momentum against Assad just as his military strength could be weakening, which could be a significant change in the trajectory of a war that has been ongoing for years.

Assad is losing ground

Bashar al-Assad's forces are losing ground against the rebels, for example in northern Idlib province, where two recent rebel victories show how strong the rebels have gotten. First, in late March, Assad's forces were pushed out of Idlib City, the region's capital. Second, in late April, rebels took Jisr al-Shughour, a strategically valuable town that lies on the Assad regime's supply line in the area and near its important coastal holdings.

""Jisr al-Shughour is a good example of how the regime is, indeed, losing ground,"" Noah Bonsey, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told me. ""Most observers were surprised at how quickly it fell, given that it is a town of some strategic importance.""

While rebels' most dramatic victories are in Idlib, they're advancing elsewhere as well. They've seized towns in the south and have repelled Assad offensives around the country.

""Losses in Idlib and the southern governorate of Deraa have placed great pressure on Assad,"" Charles Lister, a fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, writes. ""Frustration, disaffection and even incidences of protest are rising across Assad’s most ardent areas of support on Syria’s coast — some of which are now under direct attack.""

Bonsey concurs. ""Rebels have seized momentum in recent weeks and months,"" he says. ""The regime is clearly weakening to an extent that was not widely reflected in the English-language narrative surrounding the conflict.""

Rebels are more united as Assad troop losses mount

Recent regime defeats reflect growing unity among the rebels as well as fundamental weaknesses on the regime's side.

The Idlib advance, in particular, was led by Jaish al-Fatah, a new rebel coalition led by several different Islamist groups. While the coalition includes Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, the jihadis don't appear to dominate the group.

""The operations also displayed a far improved level of coordination between rival factions,"" Lister writes, ""spanning from U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) brigades, to moderate and conservative Syrian Islamists, to al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and several independent jihadist factions.""

Rebel coordination is nothing new in Syria. But this coalition stands out for its size and breadth.

""The number of fighters mobilized for the initial Idlib city campaign has been significant, and that's been just as true in subsequent operations in the north,"" Bonsey says. ""The level of coordination we've seen over several weeks, on multiple fronts, is something that we have rarely, if ever, seen from rebels in the north.""

And as the rebels have gotten more united, the regime has gotten weaker. The basic problem is attrition: Assad is losing a lot of soldiers in this war, and his regime — a sectarian Shia government in an overwhelmingly Sunni country — can't train replacements quickly enough.

Bonsey calls this an ""unsolvable manpower problem."" As a result, he says, Assad is becoming increasingly dependent on his foreign allies — Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah specifically — to lead the ground campaign.

But Iran has shown limited willingness to commit heavily to areas like Idlib, and rather is concentrating principally on defending the regime's core holdings around Damascus and the coast. According to Bonsey, ""it's a matter of priorities,"" which is to say that their resources aren't unlimited, and they've (so far) preferred to concentrate them in the most critical areas.

Iran's involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Yemen on top of Syria has left it ""really overstretched,"" according to Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. The cumulative resource investment has ""certainly had an impact on Assad losing territory in Syria,"" he concludes.

""For the regime, the status quo militarily is not sustainable,"" Bonsey says, and ""Iran's strategy in Syria does not appear sustainable. The costs to Iran of propping up Assad's rule in Syria are only going to rise with time, substantially. And what's happened with Idlib in recent weeks is only the latest indication of that.""

How Assad could ride this out: with Iran's help

Bonsey, like most Syria experts, does not believe Assad is on the road to inevitable defeat.

""While much of the subsequent commentary [to the Idlib offensive] proclaimed this as the beginning of the end for President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, we are still a long way from that,"" Lister writes.

For one thing, Iran sees the survival of the Assad regime as a critical strategic priority, as it allows Iran to supply Hezbollah and maintain a close ally in the Levant. Any post-Assad government is likely to be Sunni-dominated,and quite hostile to Iran. Tehran is probably willing to go to some lengths to keep that from happening, and Iranian intervention in the war has been a significant force.

""In strict military terms, there isn't yet a direct threat on the strategically essential territory that the regime and its backers continue to control,"" Bonsey says, ""and there isn't yet a reason to think the rebels are capable of threatening"" such a region.

Since Assad can't crush the rebels in their strongholds, then, the conflict is looking a lot like a stalemate — which it already was before this rebel offensive began.

Moreover, the unity of this new rebel coalition could collapse. The broad alliance we've seen in Idlib is held together by victory: the more they push back Assad, the more willing they are to cooperate. But if Assad's forces start beating them, the ideological and political fault lines in the coalition could cause rebel groups to turn on one another. It's happened — many times — before.

The ""big question now,"" according to Bonsey, is ""how the regime and its backers choose to respond to these defeats."" A major decider, in other words, is Iran. But as long as they see protecting the Assad regime as vital, they are likely to do what it takes to keep his core territory intact.",www.vox.com,left,gr3JJfp2zsDqHZYV

High on his list of purportedly bungled agreements ? The landmark deal that the Obama administration and its allies struck with Iran in 2015 that called for lifting punishing Western economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program . Trump has derided the agreement as “ the stupidest deal of all time , ” one that will “ give Iran , absolutely , nuclear weapons. ” Trump has alternately called for scrapping the entire thing or renegotiating its terms .
You might expect his election to make the people who opposed the Iran deal very excited by the prospect of the US pulling out of it . But that ’ s not what ’ s happening . Despite the fact that the Saudi Arabian government lobbied against the deal , a senior Saudi prince has cautioned against scrapping it . Foreign policy advocates in the US who thought the deal didn ’ t do enough to derail Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions have said it ’ s better to stick with it . And prominent Republican lawmakers have backed away from the idea of discarding it .
Their argument ? Tehran has already received tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for shipping out a large chunk of its enriched uranium and taking thousands of centrifuges offline . If Washington pulled out of the deal , Tehran could theoretically restart those centrifuges and renew its push for nuclear weapons — while keeping the money .
For the deal to be a success in American eyes , Iran would have to abide by limits on its nuclear program that are designed to last for as long as 15 years . But abandoning or trying to redo the agreement would free Iran from those restrictions . The US , in other words , arguably needs the deal more than Iran does .
“ We gave up ... all of our leverage on the front end when we gave away the moneys that were stashed in various countries around the world and so now the leverage is with them , '' Republican Sen. Bob Corker , who opposed the deal as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , told Politico .
Corker ’ s right . Because of the way the deal is structured , tearing it up would be a win for Iran .
The benefits of this arrangement are front-loaded for Iran . International sanctions have been lifted , and the country has increased its oil sales . According to some estimates , up to $ 100 billion of its frozen assets have already been thawed . Multinational corporations are racing to ink deals with a country with the second-largest economy in the Middle East : Earlier this month , for instance , Iran signed a $ 4.8 billion gas deal with the French company Total .
The US Treasury Department has given the go-ahead to Airbus and Boeing to sell scores of airplanes to Iran , a deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars . ( The House passed legislation Thursday designed to block the sale , but Obama would veto it if the bill made it through the Senate . ) Washington has also started to pay Tehran $ 1.7 billion owed for a refund for US weapons that Iran purchased but that America never delivered .
Iran didn ’ t get all that for nothing . It ’ s generally complying with the deal ’ s restrictions on nuclear activity and has agreed to an intrusive surveillance and monitoring regime . Even if it didn ’ t , though , it would be hard for Trump to reimpose the sanctions that brought Tehran to the negotiating table in the first place .
Put simply , Tehran already has what it wants , and Washington doesn ’ t .
The key issue here is that the deal isn ’ t just something between the US and Iran . It ’ s a multilateral agreement that also involved the UK , France , Russia , Germany China , and the European Union . If the US decides it wants to fully reinstate the harsh sanctions on Iran , it has to convince its allies to do so as well . But given the momentum the agreement already has and the desire many countries have to do business with Tehran , that would be extremely difficult .
“ If the US pulls out of the deal , there ’ s no guarantee that our European allies and Russia and China would walk away from the deal , ” Kelsey Davenport , the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association , told me . “ In fact , they ’ ve indicated just the opposite . ”
That means there ’ s a good chance the US would end up going it alone . Washington could , for example , attempt to reestablish sanctions directed at foreign firms buying oil from Iran . Washington could also step up its enforcement of rules barring US financial institutions from processing Iranian business transactions that use dollars , still the main currency for international trade .
That would hurt Iran , but it doesn ’ t pack close to the same kind of punch that comes with the rest of the world ’ s major powers economies isolating it at the same time . It would also create a rift between the US and its allies .
“ We ’ d be creating diplomatic fractures that don ’ t currently exist , ” said Juan Zarate , a former senior White House and Treasury Department official who shaped sanction policy against Iran in the 2000s . “ We lose the potential cohesion we have with our negotiating partners . ”
All the while , Iran would reap a win by being able to paint the US as a bully willing to buck agreements unilaterally . More importantly , it could decide to renew its push for nuclear weapons free of the Western sanctions that had slowed its progress for years .
So to sum it up , if the US decides to withdraw from the deal , it will likely end up doing it alone , losing legitimacy in the eyes of its allies and the international community and giving Iran license to pursue nuclear weapons with significantly more economic power and less stigma than it ’ s had in many years .
If Trump decides that he simply can ’ t accept the current state of affairs with Iran , the best chance he would have is to take measures to make the deal more stringent . Because it ’ s an executive agreement and not a treaty , he would be able to do this without Congress .
The US could pressure Iran by simply trying to enforce the already-established terms of the agreement extremely aggressively . So let ’ s say at some point the Iranians are particularly slow in allowing inspectors access to a certain site . A more relaxed posture in keeping with the Obama administration might possibly let something like that slide , as part of the give and take of the diplomatic process . Trump could treat that infraction as a major violation , and subsequently use that to build a case for exiting the deal if Iran doesn ’ t show better compliance .
“ That ’ s not [ eliminating ] the deal — it ’ s a stricter application of the terms of the deal at every turn , ” according to Zarate .
It ’ s worth noting that Iran has made it clear that it would not be willing to revisit the agreement . In a speech in Stockholm this past June , Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif took direct aim at then-candidate Trump ’ s campaign rhetoric about the agreement and said the deal `` is not an Iran-U.S. agreement for the Republican front-runner or anybody else to renegotiate . It 's an international understanding annexed to a Security Council resolution . ''
Trump could also ramp up sanctions against Iran that are still in place but unrelated to Iran ’ s nuclear activity . That means increasing the intensity of the penalties for Tehran ’ s human rights violations , ballistic missile tests , support for terrorist networks , assistance to the Assad regime and so on .
In the US , this would be likely be an effective maneuver for Trump , who often uses things that aren ’ t part of the deal to say the deal itself isn ’ t working . He would be able to keep the agreement intact while accurately arguing that he was being tougher on Iran than his predecessor .
It wouldn ’ t be risk-free , however : Iran would perceive it as violating the spirit of the nuclear deal , if not the letter of it . That would escalate tensions , and could result in Iran pulling out of the deal entirely and devoting new energy to its nuclear program . It would also harm Washington ’ s image in the international community because Tehran could say the US undermined an agreement that took more than a decade of grueling diplomatic work to put together .
Analysts who have faith in the deal as it is currently designed recommend more modesty in attempting to build upon it . Davenport thinks that if the US wants to revisit the agreement , it ’ s going to have to be “ under the understanding that all sides remain committed to implementing and enforcing the original agreement. ” In this scenario , Washington should look to extend restrictions rather than seek new ones , such as the ones limiting Iran ’ s ability to expand its uranium enrichment with advanced centrifuges , which end in 2027 — just 11 years from the time the deal was implemented .
It ’ s impossible to know whether Trump will actually try to follow through on his most extreme rhetoric on the campaign trail about the nuclear deal . He ’ ll feel pressure to do something , but renegotiating the pact will be extremely difficult and could quickly imperil the progress that ’ s been made in US-Iranian relations in the past couple of years . Ripping up the agreement would be even worse .","During his successful run for the presidency, Donald Trump stuck to one simple message: Americans were getting raw deals both domestically and abroad, and he’d be able to craft better ones.

Tehran has already received tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for shipping out a large chunk of its enriched uranium and taking thousands of centrifuges offline. If Washington pulled out of the deal, Tehran could theoretically restart those centrifuges and renew its push for nuclear weapons — while keeping the money.

For the deal to be a success in American eyes, Iran would have to abide by limits on its nuclear program that are designed to last for as long as 15 years. But abandoning or trying to redo the agreement would free Iran from those restrictions. The US, in other words, arguably needs the deal more than Iran does.

“We gave up ... all of our leverage on the front end when we gave away the moneys that were stashed in various countries around the world and so now the leverage is with them,"" Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who opposed the deal as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Politico.

Corker’s right. Because of the way the deal is structured, tearing it up would be a win for Iran.

The benefits of this arrangement are front-loaded for Iran. International sanctions have been lifted, and the country has increased its oil sales. According to some estimates, up to $100 billion of its frozen assets have already been thawed. Multinational corporations are racing to ink deals with a country with the second-largest economy in the Middle East: Earlier this month, for instance, Iran signed a $4.8 billion gas deal with the French company Total.

The US Treasury Department has given the go-ahead to Airbus and Boeing to sell scores of airplanes to Iran, a deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. (The House passed legislation Thursday designed to block the sale, but Obama would veto it if the bill made it through the Senate.) Washington has also started to pay Tehran $1.7 billion owed for a refund for US weapons that Iran purchased but that America never delivered.

Iran didn’t get all that for nothing. It’s generally complying with the deal’s restrictions on nuclear activity and has agreed to an intrusive surveillance and monitoring regime. Even if it didn’t, though, it would be hard for Trump to reimpose the sanctions that brought Tehran to the negotiating table in the first place.

Put simply, Tehran already has what it wants, and Washington doesn’t.

If the US acts alone, it could backfire

The key issue here is that the deal isn’t just something between the US and Iran. It’s a multilateral agreement that also involved the UK, France, Russia, Germany China, and the European Union. If the US decides it wants to fully reinstate the harsh sanctions on Iran, it has to convince its allies to do so as well. But given the momentum the agreement already has and the desire many countries have to do business with Tehran, that would be extremely difficult.

“If the US pulls out of the deal, there’s no guarantee that our European allies and Russia and China would walk away from the deal,” Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, told me. “In fact, they’ve indicated just the opposite.”

That means there’s a good chance the US would end up going it alone. Washington could, for example, attempt to reestablish sanctions directed at foreign firms buying oil from Iran. Washington could also step up its enforcement of rules barring US financial institutions from processing Iranian business transactions that use dollars, still the main currency for international trade.

That would hurt Iran, but it doesn’t pack close to the same kind of punch that comes with the rest of the world’s major powers economies isolating it at the same time. It would also create a rift between the US and its allies.

“We’d be creating diplomatic fractures that don’t currently exist,” said Juan Zarate, a former senior White House and Treasury Department official who shaped sanction policy against Iran in the 2000s. “We lose the potential cohesion we have with our negotiating partners.”

All the while, Iran would reap a win by being able to paint the US as a bully willing to buck agreements unilaterally. More importantly, it could decide to renew its push for nuclear weapons free of the Western sanctions that had slowed its progress for years.

So to sum it up, if the US decides to withdraw from the deal, it will likely end up doing it alone, losing legitimacy in the eyes of its allies and the international community and giving Iran license to pursue nuclear weapons with significantly more economic power and less stigma than it’s had in many years.

Improving the deal would be better than scrapping it

If Trump decides that he simply can’t accept the current state of affairs with Iran, the best chance he would have is to take measures to make the deal more stringent. Because it’s an executive agreement and not a treaty, he would be able to do this without Congress.

The US could pressure Iran by simply trying to enforce the already-established terms of the agreement extremely aggressively. So let’s say at some point the Iranians are particularly slow in allowing inspectors access to a certain site. A more relaxed posture in keeping with the Obama administration might possibly let something like that slide, as part of the give and take of the diplomatic process. Trump could treat that infraction as a major violation, and subsequently use that to build a case for exiting the deal if Iran doesn’t show better compliance.

“That’s not [eliminating] the deal — it’s a stricter application of the terms of the deal at every turn,” according to Zarate.

It’s worth noting that Iran has made it clear that it would not be willing to revisit the agreement. In a speech in Stockholm this past June, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif took direct aim at then-candidate Trump’s campaign rhetoric about the agreement and said the deal ""is not an Iran-U.S. agreement for the Republican front-runner or anybody else to renegotiate. It's an international understanding annexed to a Security Council resolution.""

Trump could also ramp up sanctions against Iran that are still in place but unrelated to Iran’s nuclear activity. That means increasing the intensity of the penalties for Tehran’s human rights violations, ballistic missile tests, support for terrorist networks, assistance to the Assad regime and so on.

In the US, this would be likely be an effective maneuver for Trump, who often uses things that aren’t part of the deal to say the deal itself isn’t working. He would be able to keep the agreement intact while accurately arguing that he was being tougher on Iran than his predecessor.

It wouldn’t be risk-free, however: Iran would perceive it as violating the spirit of the nuclear deal, if not the letter of it. That would escalate tensions, and could result in Iran pulling out of the deal entirely and devoting new energy to its nuclear program. It would also harm Washington’s image in the international community because Tehran could say the US undermined an agreement that took more than a decade of grueling diplomatic work to put together.

Analysts who have faith in the deal as it is currently designed recommend more modesty in attempting to build upon it. Davenport thinks that if the US wants to revisit the agreement, it’s going to have to be “under the understanding that all sides remain committed to implementing and enforcing the original agreement.” In this scenario, Washington should look to extend restrictions rather than seek new ones, such as the ones limiting Iran’s ability to expand its uranium enrichment with advanced centrifuges, which end in 2027 — just 11 years from the time the deal was implemented.

It’s impossible to know whether Trump will actually try to follow through on his most extreme rhetoric on the campaign trail about the nuclear deal. He’ll feel pressure to do something, but renegotiating the pact will be extremely difficult and could quickly imperil the progress that’s been made in US-Iranian relations in the past couple of years. Ripping up the agreement would be even worse.

DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( AP ) — Iranian demonstrators defied a heavy police presence Sunday night to protest their country ’ s days of denials that it shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane carrying 176 people , the latest unrest to roil the capital amid soaring tensions with the United States .
Videos posted online showed protesters shouting anti-government slogans and moving through subway stations and sidewalks , many around Azadi , or Freedom , Square after an earlier call for people to demonstrate there . Other videos suggested similar protests were taking place in other Iranian cities .
Protesters often wore hoods and covered their faces , probably to avoid being recognized by surveillance cameras . Some online videos purported to show police firing tear gas sporadically , though there was no immediate wholesale crackdown on demonstrators .
Meanwhile , in an emotional speech before parliament , the head of the Revolutionary Guard apologized for the shootdown and insisted it was a tragic mistake .
“ I swear to almighty God that I wished I was on that plane and had crashed with them and burned but had not witnessed this tragic incident , ” said Gen. Hossein Salami . “ I have never been this embarrassed in my entire life . Never . ”
Iran ’ s state-run media , as well as semiofficial news agencies and publications , did not immediately report on the demonstrations . However , international rights groups already have called on Iran to allow people to protest peacefully as allowed by the country ’ s constitution .
“ After successive national traumas in a short time period , people should be allowed to safely grieve and demand accountability , ” said Hadi Ghaemi , the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran . “ Iranians shouldn ’ t have to risk their lives to exercise their constitutional right to peaceful assembly . ”
Riot police in black uniforms and helmets earlier massed in Vali-e Asr Square , at Tehran University and other landmarks . Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes , and plainclothes security men were also out in force . People looked down as they walked briskly past police , hoping not to draw attention to themselves .
The plane crash early Wednesday killed everyone on board , mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians . After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame , authorities on Saturday admitted accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders .
Iran downed the flight as it braced for possible American retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces . The missile attack , which caused no casualties , was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani , Iran ’ s top general , in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad . But no retaliation came .
Iranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy . They are also mourning the dead , which included many young people who were studying abroad .
“ Even talking about it makes my heart beat faster and makes me sad , ” said Zahra Razeghi , a Tehran resident . “ I feel ashamed when I think about their families . ”
“ The denial and covering up the truth over the past three days greatly added to the suffering and pain of the families , and me , ” she added .
Another individual , who identified himself only as Saeed , said Iran ’ s largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for “ political reasons . ”
“ Later developments changed the game , and they had to tell the truth , ” he said .
Earlier Sunday , hundreds of students gathered at Tehran ’ s Shahid Beheshti University to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash , the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported .
Bahareh Arvin , a reformist member of the Tehran City Council , took to social media to say she was resigning in protest at the government ’ s lies and corruption . “ With the current mechanism , there is no hope of reform , ” she said .
Some Iranian artists , including famed director Masoud Kimiai , withdrew from an upcoming international film festival . Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over the false reporting about the cause of the plane crash .
President Donald Trump , who has expressed support for past waves of anti-government demonstrations in Iran , addressed the country ’ s leaders in a tweet , saying “ DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. ” He later tweeted the same message again in Farsi .
“ The World is watching . More importantly , the USA is watching , ” he tweeted .
Iranians demonstrated in November after the government hiked gas prices , holding large protests across the nation . The government shut down internet access for days , making it difficult to gauge the scale of the protests and the subsequent crackdown . Amnesty International later said more than 300 people were killed .
A candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest , with hundreds of people chanting against the country ’ s leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas . Protests were also held in the city of Isfahan and elsewhere .
Police briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran , Rob Macaire , who said he went to the vigil without knowing it would turn into a protest .
“ Can confirm I wasn ’ t taking part in any demonstrations ! ” he tweeted . “ Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of # PS752 tragedy . Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British . I left after 5 mins , when some started chanting . ”
He said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area .
Britain said its envoy was detained “ without grounds or explanation ” and in “ flagrant violation of international law . ”
Iran ’ s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later tweeted that Macaire was arrested “ as an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering . ”
Araghchi said when police informed him that a man was arrested who claimed to be the British ambassador , he didn ’ t believe them . But he said that once he spoke to Macaire by phone , he realized it was him , and that the ambassador was freed 15 minutes later .
Iran ’ s Foreign Ministry later summoned the British ambassador over his ” illegal and inappropriate presence ” at the protest , it said on its Telegram channel .
Alaeddin Boroujerdi , a member of Iran ’ s parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy , accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion . Dozens of hard-liners later gathered outside the British Embassy , chanting “ Death to England. ” They also called for the ambassador to be expelled and the embassy to be closed .
Iranian media , meanwhile , focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash , with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign .
The hard-line daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline “ A sky full of sadness , ” while the Hamshahri daily went with “ Shame , ” and the IRAN daily said “ Unforgivable . ”
Mehdi Karroubi , an opposition activist under house arrest , lashed out at Khamenei himself , saying that as commander in chief he was “ directly responsible . ”
“ If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people , then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership , ” he said in a statement .

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian demonstrators defied a heavy police presence Sunday night to protest their country’s days of denials that it shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane carrying 176 people, the latest unrest to roil the capital amid soaring tensions with the United States.

Videos posted online showed protesters shouting anti-government slogans and moving through subway stations and sidewalks, many around Azadi, or Freedom, Square after an earlier call for people to demonstrate there. Other videos suggested similar protests were taking place in other Iranian cities.

Protesters often wore hoods and covered their faces, probably to avoid being recognized by surveillance cameras. Some online videos purported to show police firing tear gas sporadically, though there was no immediate wholesale crackdown on demonstrators.

Meanwhile, in an emotional speech before parliament, the head of the Revolutionary Guard apologized for the shootdown and insisted it was a tragic mistake.

“I swear to almighty God that I wished I was on that plane and had crashed with them and burned but had not witnessed this tragic incident,” said Gen. Hossein Salami. “I have never been this embarrassed in my entire life. Never.”

Iran’s state-run media, as well as semiofficial news agencies and publications, did not immediately report on the demonstrations. However, international rights groups already have called on Iran to allow people to protest peacefully as allowed by the country’s constitution.

“After successive national traumas in a short time period, people should be allowed to safely grieve and demand accountability,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. “Iranians shouldn’t have to risk their lives to exercise their constitutional right to peaceful assembly.”

Riot police in black uniforms and helmets earlier massed in Vali-e Asr Square, at Tehran University and other landmarks. Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes, and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.

The plane crash early Wednesday killed everyone on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame, authorities on Saturday admitted accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.

Iran downed the flight as it braced for possible American retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces. The missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad. But no retaliation came.

Iranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy. They are also mourning the dead, which included many young people who were studying abroad.

“Even talking about it makes my heart beat faster and makes me sad,” said Zahra Razeghi, a Tehran resident. “I feel ashamed when I think about their families.”

“The denial and covering up the truth over the past three days greatly added to the suffering and pain of the families, and me,” she added.

Another individual, who identified himself only as Saeed, said Iran’s largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for “political reasons.”

“Later developments changed the game, and they had to tell the truth,” he said.

Earlier Sunday, hundreds of students gathered at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.

Bahareh Arvin, a reformist member of the Tehran City Council, took to social media to say she was resigning in protest at the government’s lies and corruption. “With the current mechanism, there is no hope of reform,” she said.

Some Iranian artists, including famed director Masoud Kimiai, withdrew from an upcoming international film festival. Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over the false reporting about the cause of the plane crash.

President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for past waves of anti-government demonstrations in Iran, addressed the country’s leaders in a tweet, saying “DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS.” He later tweeted the same message again in Farsi.

“The World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching,” he tweeted.

Iranians demonstrated in November after the government hiked gas prices, holding large protests across the nation. The government shut down internet access for days, making it difficult to gauge the scale of the protests and the subsequent crackdown. Amnesty International later said more than 300 people were killed .

A candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest, with hundreds of people chanting against the country’s leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas. Protests were also held in the city of Isfahan and elsewhere.

Police briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, who said he went to the vigil without knowing it would turn into a protest.

“Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations!” he tweeted. “Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.”

He said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area.

Britain said its envoy was detained “without grounds or explanation” and in “flagrant violation of international law.”

Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later tweeted that Macaire was arrested “as an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering.”

Araghchi said when police informed him that a man was arrested who claimed to be the British ambassador, he didn’t believe them. But he said that once he spoke to Macaire by phone, he realized it was him, and that the ambassador was freed 15 minutes later.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry later summoned the British ambassador over his ”illegal and inappropriate presence” at the protest, it said on its Telegram channel.

Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of Iran’s parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion. Dozens of hard-liners later gathered outside the British Embassy, chanting “Death to England.” They also called for the ambassador to be expelled and the embassy to be closed.

Iranian media, meanwhile, focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.

The hard-line daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline “A sky full of sadness,” while the Hamshahri daily went with “Shame,” and the IRAN daily said “Unforgivable.”

Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself, saying that as commander in chief he was “directly responsible.”

“If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership,” he said in a statement.

(CNN) - Sen. John McCain on Wednesday said Mitt Romney missed an opportunity to go after the president over Libya in the second presidential debate.

Asked whether Romney failed to press President Barack Obama on the administration's handling of last month's consulate attack, the Arizona senator said ""in a way, he did"" on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""



During the debate, Obama said he referred to the Libya attack as an ""act of terror"" the day after the violence last month. Romney disputed the claim, sparking a fiery exchange over whether the president used the term.

On Wednesday, some political observers noted Romney spent too much time over the semantics, rather than moving on and asking more questions about the security of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the attack on the U.S. facility on September 11, 2012.

As it turns out, the president did use the words ""acts of terror"" in the Rose Garden speech, but opponents point to the fact that some in the administration waffled on calling it a terrorist attack in the following days. Certain officials, instead, cited protests over an anti-Islam film as the trigger of the violence.

McCain, however, sided with those who say the president was not forceful enough in his choice of words after the attack.

""When you look at the president's Rose Garden statement, it really wasn't talking about that act,"" said the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.

Obama, in fact, used the phrase toward the end of the speech, saying, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" Critics, however, point to the fact that he mentioned the September 11, 2001, attacks before the phrase in his speech and could have been referring to that disaster, as well.

Gen. Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , revealed the options in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , D-Mich . The letter was sent as , on the other side of the Hill , the House Intelligence Committee signed off on the administration 's call to arm the Syria opposition -- though the committee , which held that up for weeks , continued to voice reservations .
Dempsey 's letter , released Monday , went far beyond arming the opposition in outlining potential options . He sent the letter after taking heat at last week 's confirmation hearing from Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , who pressed Dempsey for his advice on Syria while suggesting the administration had not done enough -- McCain threatened to place a hold on Dempsey 's nomination until he got answers .
In the letter , Dempsey gave five options on Syria beyond providing humanitarian assistance , which the U.S. already is doing .
At the least invasive end , he said , is the option of training , advising and assisting the rebels . The next level up would be conducting limited strikes on `` high-value regime '' military targets .
A no-fly zone , which according to Dempsey could cost up to a billion dollars per month and would include shooting down regime aircraft and conducting strikes on their airfields .
The establishment of `` buffer zones , '' which would be `` specific geographic areas '' where the opposition would safely organize and train . This would require thousands of U.S. ground forces , Dempsey said , `` even if positioned outside Syria , '' to protect these zones .
A campaign to secure chemical weapons . This would entail destroying portions of Syria 's stockpile , interdicting shipments and seizing other components . At minimum , Dempsey said , this would include a no-fly zone and thousands of special operations and other forces to secure critical sites .

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed the options in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich. The letter was sent as, on the other side of the Hill, the House Intelligence Committee signed off on the administration's call to arm the Syria opposition -- though the committee, which held that up for weeks, continued to voice reservations.

Dempsey's letter, released Monday, went far beyond arming the opposition in outlining potential options. He sent the letter after taking heat at last week's confirmation hearing from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who pressed Dempsey for his advice on Syria while suggesting the administration had not done enough -- McCain threatened to place a hold on Dempsey's nomination until he got answers.

In the letter, Dempsey gave five options on Syria beyond providing humanitarian assistance, which the U.S. already is doing.

At the least invasive end, he said, is the option of training, advising and assisting the rebels. The next level up would be conducting limited strikes on ""high-value regime"" military targets.

The three other options are increasingly costly and risky.

They include:

A no-fly zone, which according to Dempsey could cost up to a billion dollars per month and would include shooting down regime aircraft and conducting strikes on their airfields.

The establishment of ""buffer zones,"" which would be ""specific geographic areas"" where the opposition would safely organize and train. This would require thousands of U.S. ground forces, Dempsey said, ""even if positioned outside Syria,"" to protect these zones.

A campaign to secure chemical weapons. This would entail destroying portions of Syria's stockpile, interdicting shipments and seizing other components. At minimum, Dempsey said, this would include a no-fly zone and thousands of special operations and other forces to secure critical sites.

Dempsey stressed that these are just options that have been prepared, and that some options ""may not be feasible in time or cost.""

On another front, the House Intelligence Committee gave tentative approval toward arming the opposition.

Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said that despite ""very strong concerns about the strength of the administration's plans in Syria and its chances for success"" there was ""consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations.""

Rep. Jim Himes is willing to vote against the wishes of his constituents. Probably not this time, though.

""Like the rest of the country, my constituency is pretty much opposed to the intervention in Syria,"" says the Connecticut Democrat. ""Since health care reform, I haven't seen an issue that energized as many people.""

His colleagues in the House and Senate report the same.

It's a reflection of a public mood that's turned decisively against military action in Syria. The latest polls show that a solid majority of Americans are opposed to a military intervention.

In terms of calls and emails coming into Congress, opposition has been closer to unanimous.

Florida Republican Rep. Steve Southerland said last week that of the 300 people who called or emailed his office, 96 percent opposed U.S. intervention in Syria. On Thursday, Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio reported this tally of constituents who called, emailed or wrote his office: 1135 opposed, 18 for.

Senate offices don't appear to be much different.

""As of last Friday, for our D.C. office, we had almost 450 calls against any U.S. action in Syria, and only two calls in support,"" says Chad Gallegos, spokesman for Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran. ""In our Jackson office, [there were] almost 200 calls. None of them were supporting U.S. intervention.""

That study found that upwards of 5,000 associations, nonprofit groups and corporations have Web pages designed to drive mail traffic to Capitol Hill — and, in fact, may account for the majority of it.

Certainly, on the Syria issue, there are groups on both the right and the left encouraging people to make their opinions known to Congress.

That ’ s set off a complicated race between hawks and the White House to win over an eclectic group of senators , each with his or her own particular concerns .
Any casual sports fan can attest that an almost .800 winning percentage is no easy feat , but that ’ s what Obama and his Hill allies need to pull off . And people on both sides of the rancorous Iran debate concede they have no idea whether Obama and his congressional allies can get there .
It ’ s hard to imagine a liberal stalwart like Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-Ore. ) — who is formally undecided — coming out against the deal . But other senators are much tougher to read , even to people they speak with regularly . Among the enigmas are the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee , Maryland ’ s Ben Cardin , and Cory Booker , the star freshman from New Jersey caught between his loyalty to Obama and fierce opposition from Jewish groups .
“ Each has their own particular or unique approach , ” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) . “ We ’ re going after any Senate Democrat . ”
“ One of the reasons is that I ’ m confident we ’ re going to get 60 votes against the agreement , ” said former Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , an independent who allied with Democrats and is now a forceful opponent of the deal , “ is because Chuck Schumer is out there against it , ” referring to the New York senator and presumed next Democratic leader .
Here ’ s ███ ’ s look at the five key Democratic swing votes who will likely decide which side comes out on top :
If there ’ s a bellwether left in the Senate Democratic caucus , it ’ s the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee . A Jewish lawmaker from Baltimore , Cardin helped draft the law to give Congress a vote on the Iran deal with his triangulation between a White House that feared congressional oversight and Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , now an opponent of the deal .
The Maryland Democrat is a more conciliatory figure than Sen. Robert Menendez ( D-N.J. ) , who lost his top spot on the panel after being indicted and is a strident critic of the president ’ s Iran policy . And though Cardin is more consistently supportive of the president ’ s foreign policy portfolio than Menendez , the Marylander has been irked by not being able to see a document detailing a deal between international inspectors and Iran .
Any Democrats waiting to see which way Cardin goes will have to sit tight : He ’ s not expected to announce a position until late next week at the earliest , and Corker says his friend and co-leader of the committee is truly undecided .
“ My conversations have not been to try to influence him and he knows that . We share the desire for the Senate to appropriately vote on this issue , ” Corker said in a phone interview . “ We ’ re both grown-ups . ”
Booker is getting buffeted on Iran probably more than any of the remaining undecided Democrats — including by his state ’ s voluble Republican governor and 2016 contender , Chris Christie .
At a news conference this week with Jewish leaders who oppose the pact , Christie called on all New Jersey lawmakers to oppose the Iran accord . But his real target was clear .
“ For Sen. Booker this morning , the people of your state , the people of this country and the people of the world are counting on you to be a strong , direct and powerful moral voice , ” Christie said at the event , held at the Chabad House at Rutgers University . “ To look your president in the eye — to look our president in the eye — and say , ‘ No , Mr. President . Not this time . ’ ”
A Booker spokeswoman said the senator will decide how to vote on the Iran agreement “ based upon what he believes is best for America ’ s national security regardless of political pressure , lobbying or theatrics . ”

The Delaware Democrat is showing a flair for drama as he mulls his decision . Coons has been one of the most publicly skeptical undecided Democrats and has spoken more with the White House on Iran than perhaps any other issue during his five-year run in the Senate .

On Friday , his senior colleague , Sen. Tom Carper , endorsed the agreement as a “ good deal . ”

J Street , a liberal pro-Israel group backing the deal , commissioned a poll earlier this month that showed 62 percent of Jewish voters in Colorado support the agreement — and called out Bennet for his noncommittal stance on the accord .
But he ’ s also been pounded with pressure campaigns from anti-deal groups such as Secure America Now , which has orchestrated thousands of calls to Bennet ’ s office urging the senator to oppose the agreement .

It’s hard to imagine a liberal stalwart like Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) — who is formally undecided — coming out against the deal. But other senators are much tougher to read, even to people they speak with regularly. Among the enigmas are the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland’s Ben Cardin, and Cory Booker, the star freshman from New Jersey caught between his loyalty to Obama and fierce opposition from Jewish groups.

“Each has their own particular or unique approach,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “We’re going after any Senate Democrat.”

“One of the reasons is that I’m confident we’re going to get 60 votes against the agreement,” said former Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who allied with Democrats and is now a forceful opponent of the deal, “is because Chuck Schumer is out there against it,” referring to the New York senator and presumed next Democratic leader.

Here’s POLITICO’s look at the five key Democratic swing votes who will likely decide which side comes out on top:

Ben Cardin of Maryland

If there’s a bellwether left in the Senate Democratic caucus, it’s the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. A Jewish lawmaker from Baltimore, Cardin helped draft the law to give Congress a vote on the Iran deal with his triangulation between a White House that feared congressional oversight and Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), now an opponent of the deal.

The Maryland Democrat is a more conciliatory figure than Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who lost his top spot on the panel after being indicted and is a strident critic of the president’s Iran policy. And though Cardin is more consistently supportive of the president’s foreign policy portfolio than Menendez, the Marylander has been irked by not being able to see a document detailing a deal between international inspectors and Iran.

Any Democrats waiting to see which way Cardin goes will have to sit tight: He’s not expected to announce a position until late next week at the earliest, and Corker says his friend and co-leader of the committee is truly undecided.

“My conversations have not been to try to influence him and he knows that. We share the desire for the Senate to appropriately vote on this issue,” Corker said in a phone interview. “We’re both grown-ups.”

Cory Booker of New Jersey

Booker is getting buffeted on Iran probably more than any of the remaining undecided Democrats — including by his state’s voluble Republican governor and 2016 contender, Chris Christie.

At a news conference this week with Jewish leaders who oppose the pact, Christie called on all New Jersey lawmakers to oppose the Iran accord. But his real target was clear.

Booker this morning, the people of your state, the people of this country and the people of the world are counting on you to be a strong, direct and powerful moral voice,” Christie said at the event, held at the Chabad House at Rutgers University. “To look your president in the eye — to look our president in the eye — and say, ‘No, Mr. President. Not this time.’”

A Booker spokeswoman said the senator will decide how to vote on the Iran agreement “based upon what he believes is best for America’s national security regardless of political pressure, lobbying or theatrics.”

Two other Democratic lawmakers from the New York region, Schumer and Menendez, are the party’s only senators so far on record opposed to the Iran deal.

Chris Coons of Delaware

The Delaware Democrat is showing a flair for drama as he mulls his decision. Coons has been one of the most publicly skeptical undecided Democrats and has spoken more with the White House on Iran than perhaps any other issue during his five-year run in the Senate.

He’s also not settling for a mere press release to make news, instead holding a public announcement on Tuesday at the University of Delaware.

Aside from Cardin, he’s the only undecided Democrat left on the Foreign Relations Committee. Obama spoke with Coons while the senator was on vacation earlier in August, and last week the senator met with constituent groups that included strong opponents of the deal, an aide said.

“They’ve been very responsive to the extent I’ve got concerns and questions,” Coons said of the White House before Congress left for its August recess. “I’ve had opportunities to raise them and try to resolve them.”

On Friday, his senior colleague, Sen. Tom Carper, endorsed the agreement as a “good deal.”

Michael Bennet of Colorado

The sole vulnerable Democratic senator up for reelection in 2016, Bennet faces an added layer of pressure that’s made him a prime target for both sides ahead of the Senate vote in September.

The first-term senator hinted this week he’s leaning “yes.”

“I have come to the conclusion that there is not a better deal available,” he said at an energy event in Denver, though he added he’s still making up his mind. “We are faced with a lot of bad choices now because we eliminated a lot of choices along the way.”

J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group backing the deal, commissioned a poll earlier this month that showed 62 percent of Jewish voters in Colorado support the agreement — and called out Bennet for his noncommittal stance on the accord.

But he’s also been pounded with pressure campaigns from anti-deal groups such as Secure America Now, which has orchestrated thousands of calls to Bennet’s office urging the senator to oppose the agreement.

Bennet’s support for the deal would be “a clear indication that he will follow Obama’s troubling direction on national security issues,” said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut

On one hand, Blumenthal is hearing from the ultimate Democratic hawk, Joe Lieberman. On the other, his fellow home-state senator, Democrat Chris Murphy, is an active participant on the pro-deal whip team.

Blumenthal has been a strong backer of congressional sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s economy. But he’s keeping a low profile as Congress prepares to vote on the nuclear deal.

In an interview this summer, Blumenthal said he wouldn’t be swayed by the decision of Schumer or any of the Democratic boosters of the agreement. “This issue is so consequential that the real guides here are going to be my personal conscience and conviction and all of the facts,” he said.

The Connecticut lawmaker is up for reelection in 2016 and may not want to cause waves among many of his liberal constituents. But Lieberman, who spoke with the senator this month, isn’t letting him off easy.

“He raised the expectations of the people there, that he’s going to do the right thing,” said Tom Swan, executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, who met with Blumenthal in Hartford.

Blumenthal also spoke with opponents of the Iran deal who were holding their own protests on Wednesday, an aide said.

Nonetheless, his election was the crowning act in this drama signifying that the Islamist mainstream saw no contradiction in working within a democratic system and accepting the rules of the game while remaining true to its faith.

The major lesson that Islamists in the Middle East are likely to learn from this episode is that they will not be allowed to exercise power no matter how many compromises they make in both the domestic and foreign policy arenas. This is likely to push a substantial portion of mainstream Islamists into the arms of the extremists who reject democracy and ideological compromise.

A segment of this rejectionist camp is also not averse to taking up arms against the ""system"" that suppresses them as well as against its foreign supporters. It is almost certain that some elements among the disillusioned mainstream Islamists will decide to join this militant trend and resort to arms -- thus increasing the odds of this volatile region descending into greater anarchy and turmoil.",www.cnn.com,left,SceqIj3D1EquuRgB

After 18 days of intense and often fractious talks , negotiators in Vienna announced that they had reached an agreement designed to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and another U.S. military intervention in the Muslim world . The pact included late concessions by the Obama administration granting Tehran the right to object to international inspections of Iranian military sites and left unanswered questions about Iran ’ s past nuclear weapons activities .
Mr. Obama hailed the deal as a step toward a “ more hopeful world , ” and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said it marked “ a new chapter ” in his nation ’ s relations with the world . British Prime Minister David Cameron said it “ will help to make our world a safer place . ”
Israel said it would try to stop what it called a “ historic surrender . ”
In Congress , the announcement touched off objections from Republican lawmakers and some Democrats who said the deal doesn ’ t call for the dismantling of Iran ’ s nuclear facilities and doesn ’ t meet Mr. Obama ’ s stated goal of forcing Iran to submit to inspections “ anytime , anywhere . ”
Congress now has 60 days to review the agreement , and the president has said he would veto any effort to unravel the deal . Even some opponents of the agreement conceded that Republicans would be unlikely to muster enough votes to override a veto and stop the accord .

The agreement quickly became a test in the presidential race , with Republican candidates lining up against it and some , such as Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , calling on Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to repudiate the deal . Mrs. Clinton , a former secretary of state under Mr. Obama , said as president she would be “ absolutely devoted to assuring the agreement is followed . ”
Critics pointed out that the negotiations failed to resolve the issue of three Americans who have become Iranian prisoners : Christian missionary Saeed Abedini , journalist Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post and former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati . Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the U.S. “ will continue to work for their safe and their swift return . ”
In Tehran , young Iranians danced in streets and motorists honked their horns upon hearing news of the accord . Some people blew South African-style vuvuzela horns like those heard at the World Cup .
The accord marked a dramatic break from decades of animosity between the United States and Iran , countries that have called each other the “ leading state sponsor of terrorism ” and “ the Great Satan. ” Mr. Obama has been pushing for the agreement for years as the capstone of his diplomatic legacy , after he rallied international partners to keep economic sanctions in place to force Iran back to the negotiating table .
“ This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction , ” Mr. Obama said in an early-morning address at the White House that was carried live on Iranian state television . “ We should seize it . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement a “ bad mistake of historic proportion ” that will give Iran a “ sure path to nuclear weapons. ” He said pointedly that Israel isn ’ t bound by the deal .
“ Wide-ranging concessions were made in all of the areas which should have prevented Iran from getting the ability to arm itself with a nuclear weapon , ” Mr. Netanyahu said . “ The desire to sign an agreement was stronger than everything else . ”
Mr. Kerry , who led the U.S. negotiating team , called Mr. Netanyahu ’ s criticisms “ way over the top . ”
“ Israel is safer ” as a result of the accord , Mr. Kerry said on MSNBC . “ This is under attack by people who really don ’ t know the terms of the agreement . ”
Mr. Obama tried to assure Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call that the agreement is verifiable and “ will remove the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran , ” the White House said .
The negotiating has been a major source of tension between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu for years , building up to the Israeli ’ s address to Congress in March that wasn ’ t sanctioned by the White House .
Several Jewish-American groups came out Tuesday in opposition to the deal . The Simon Wiesenthal Center likened it to the Munich agreement in 1938 that made concessions to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler .
Syrian President Bashar Assad , who has depended on Iran ’ s support while waging a brutal civil war , praised the agreement and suggested that the lifting of sanctions against Tehran would result in more aid for his regime .
“ We are confident that the Islamic Republic of Iran will support , with greater drive , just causes of nations and work for peace and stability in the region and the world , ” Mr. Assad said in a congratulatory message to Iran ’ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , published by state news agency SANA .
Saudi Arabia ’ s state news agency said the kingdom warned Iran not to use money resulting from the lifting of sanctions to incite turmoil in the region . The Saudi Press Agency said Tehran must use the funds in the service of the Iranian people .
Mr. Obama dismissed skeptics who argued that Iran will cheat . He said the deal all but eliminates the possibility that Tehran could rebuild a covert nuclear weapons program .
“ Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off , ” Mr. Obama said . “ This deal is not built on trust . It is built on verification . ”
Ensuring Iran ’ s compliance will be a far-reaching job . The agreement calls for Tehran to reduce its number of uranium-enriching centrifuges from about 19,000 to 6,000 , cut its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and convert its heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak to use for research instead of bomb-making .
Iran currently has enough nuclear material to build at least 10 bombs , if it is enriched further to weapons grade .
The limits on centrifuges will be in place for 10 years , then gradually relaxed over the next three . Iran also commits to using only its current models , rather than more advanced centrifuges it hoped to install .
Iran committed to convert its Fordo enrichment site — dug deep into a mountainside and thought impervious to air attack — into a research center . The site will still house centrifuges , but they will make medical isotopes instead of enriched uranium . There will be less than one-tenth as many of these centrifuges as there originally were .
The agreement also calls for Tehran to give more access to its nuclear program to the U.N. nuclear agency . If that agency identifies a suspicious site , an arbitration panel with a Western majority will decide whether Iran must give inspectors access within 24 days . All sites , including military ones , may be inspected if the agency has solid evidence of undeclared nuclear activity .
Mr. Kerry said the deal “ will bring insight and accountability into Iran ’ s nuclear program . ”
“ This is the good deal that we have sought , ” Mr. Kerry said , adding that the agreement “ also gives us the greatest assurance that we have had that Iran will not pursue a weapon covertly . ”
Under the deal , all U.S. and European Union nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended — likely beginning in a few months — after inspectors have verified that Iran is adhering to its commitments . If Iran fails to fulfill its obligations , those sanctions could “ snap back ” into place , although critics say such an effort to rebuild international consensus to reimpose economic penalties is unlikely .
An arms embargo against Iran will stand for five years , and restrictions on Iran ’ s ballistic missile programs for eight years .
Mr. Obama said the failure to reach an agreement would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East . He asked Congress to “ consider what happens in a world without the deal . ”
“ We give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully , ” Mr. Obama said . “ No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East . No deal means no lasting constraints on Iran ’ s nuclear program . The world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission . ”
House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , was among the lawmakers speaking out against the agreement , calling it “ unacceptable . ”
“ If , in fact , it ’ s as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment , we ’ ll do everything we can to stop it , ” Mr. Boehner said .
Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas , who led 47 Republican senators in writing to Iran ’ s leaders to warn against a deal , called the agreement “ a terrible , dangerous mistake . ”
Supporters of the pact included Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , who said it “ offers a verifiable , diplomatic resolution to one of our most pressing national security challenges . ”
Mr. Obama said he welcomed “ robust debate ” by lawmakers over the deal , but he vowed to veto any effort to kill it .
“ I will remind Congress that you don ’ t make deals like this with your friends , ” Mr. Obama said . “ I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interests of the United States and our allies . So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal . ”
The president cautioned lawmakers not to engage in a reckless escalation of rhetoric against Iran .

Lee, Siobhan Hughes, Carol.Lee Wsj.Com, Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—Six days after reaching the nuclear deal with Iran , the White House in July set up what aides dubbed an “ anti-war room ” in the basement of the West Wing .
The windowless hub became the seat of the administration ’ s aggressive campaign to push back against critics of the deal . Whiteboards listed lawmakers ’ positions . Computer screens logged onto Twitter to monitor commentary from opponents , and a small television helped staffers keep tabs on the cable-news debate . For weeks , the operation buzzed with senior White House officials , digital gurus and rank-and-file aides running a rapid-response operation .
The “ anti-war ” name of the room underscored the White House ’ s realization earlier this year that the nuclear deal was unlikely to win any Republican votes in Congress and would require a battle plan focused on mustering support among Democrats skeptical of the deal . It also reflected a chief White House message : Those who supported the nuclear deal favored diplomacy ; opponents favored war with Iran .
Administration officials ran the operation like a political campaign , using well-funded outside groups to lay the groundwork for casting supporters of the deal as pro-war , soliciting public endorsements from foreign-policy heavyweights and rekindling relationships with congressional Democrats sidelined since the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 election and the Senate in 2014 .
“ The primary focus was securing the support of Democrats , ” said Ben Rhodes , a deputy national security adviser .
The resulting narrow , partisan victory this week leaves President Barack Obama ’ s top foreign-policy initiative vulnerable to challenges and vigorous debate in the 2016 campaigns , much like his signature domestic achievement , the Affordable Care Act , which defined elections and shaped congressional deliberations over the past five years .
The accord also faces hurdles in coming weeks as Iran ’ s parliament prepares to vote on it and Republicans on Capitol Hill pivot from a stinging defeat to efforts to scuttle the deal in other ways , including legal challenges and legislation hitting Tehran with new sanctions opposed by the White House .

In addition to considering an array of new sanctions on Iran that the White House doesn ’ t want passed in coming weeks , if at all , GOP lawmakers are trying to ensure the agreement faces repeated challenges .
“ The limitation on the president is he ’ s only got the ability to do this during his term , ” Rep. Peter Roskam ( R. , Ill. ) said in an interview . “ Part of our strategy is to slow this down . ”","WASHINGTON—Six days after reaching the nuclear deal with Iran, the White House in July set up what aides dubbed an “anti-war room” in the basement of the West Wing.

The windowless hub became the seat of the administration’s aggressive campaign to push back against critics of the deal. Whiteboards listed lawmakers’ positions. Computer screens logged onto Twitter to monitor commentary from opponents, and a small television helped staffers keep tabs on the cable-news debate. For weeks, the operation buzzed with senior White House officials, digital gurus and rank-and-file aides running a rapid-response operation.

The “anti-war” name of the room underscored the White House’s realization earlier this year that the nuclear deal was unlikely to win any Republican votes in Congress and would require a battle plan focused on mustering support among Democrats skeptical of the deal. It also reflected a chief White House message: Those who supported the nuclear deal favored diplomacy; opponents favored war with Iran.

Administration officials ran the operation like a political campaign, using well-funded outside groups to lay the groundwork for casting supporters of the deal as pro-war, soliciting public endorsements from foreign-policy heavyweights and rekindling relationships with congressional Democrats sidelined since the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 election and the Senate in 2014.

“The primary focus was securing the support of Democrats,” said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser.

The resulting narrow, partisan victory this week leaves President Barack Obama’s top foreign-policy initiative vulnerable to challenges and vigorous debate in the 2016 campaigns, much like his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, which defined elections and shaped congressional deliberations over the past five years.

The accord also faces hurdles in coming weeks as Iran’s parliament prepares to vote on it and Republicans on Capitol Hill pivot from a stinging defeat to efforts to scuttle the deal in other ways, including legal challenges and legislation hitting Tehran with new sanctions opposed by the White House.

In Mr. Obama’s view, the potential fallout was worth it, because the stakes involving the Iranian nuclear program were so high, administration officials said.

During the fight over his health-care bill, debate dragged on for nearly a year before Mr. Obama disbanded efforts to draw GOP support and engineered a victory solely with Democratic votes.

Until recently, Mr. Obama’s fire wall had been the House. The White House earlier this summer zeroed in on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) as a critical ally. As speaker, Mrs. Pelosi had been a key driver in the successful passage of the health-care law in 2010.

Never has it been more important to resist the impulse to cover our eyes about Syria.

It’s being described as the final chapter in Syria’s devastating civil war, but that’s by no means certain. And never, since the conflict began nine years ago, has it been more important to resist the impulse to simply cover our eyes.

The immediate reason is what’s happening on the ground. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are bearing the brunt of a no-holds-barred offensive by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to subdue the last major pocket of rebel resistance, in the northwest region of Idlib. The onslaught began late last year. Mr. Assad’s forces are backed by Russian mercenaries, Iran and its Hezbollah militia allies, and, crucially, Russian air power.

For even if civilians in Idlib survive the latest fighting, they know their longer-term fate hinges on an intensifying geopolitical tug of war over Syria’s future.

The protagonists

The main protagonists are Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Their uneasy partnership of recent years – in pursuit of a mutually acceptable arrangement over a postwar Syria – is now under huge strain in Idlib.

Turkey, which wants to retain a security zone across the border in northern Syria, has sent in an extra 7,000 troops to support Islamist rebel forces against the Russian-Syrian offensive. Last week, Turkish soldiers came under an artillery and air attack that left at least several dozen of them dead – the largest single loss for Turkish forces in the war.

While they’ve been careful not to blame Russia directly for the attacks – ahead of a planned Putin-Erdoğan meeting in Moscow later this week – the Turks have announced a new offensive against Mr. Assad’s forces. The apparent aim: a cease-fire, negotiated through Moscow, that would include a lasting sphere of influence for Turkey in northern Syria.

But as if that’s not complicated enough, Turkey is also a key NATO state. Mr. Erdoğan is pressing both NATO and the European Union to back him in Syria. So far, there’s little sign of NATO support. He has seriously alienated the alliance by trying to play it off against the Russians, especially by his purchase of an advanced Russian anti-aircraft system over strong U.S. objections.

Yet since the attack on Turkish troops in Idlib, Erdoğan has begun sending thousands of people toward neighboring European countries – in effect threatening a repeat of the major 2015 refugee surge that led to a political crisis inside the EU.

The missing players

And that brings us to what Sherlock Holmes memorably called “the dog that didn’t bark.” Largely missing from the diplomatic debate over Syria are the two most historically influential players in the Western alliance: the United States and Britain. They essentially dealt themselves out in 2013, when the British Parliament and, days later, then-President Barack Obama retreated from even limited military action to enforce their “red line” against Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons.

Whether the reprisal strike would have provided a meaningful military deterrent is uncertain. But the political and diplomatic message was clear: Especially with the example of the American-led invasion of Iraq, on inaccurate allegations that Saddam Hussein possessed undisclosed stocks of unconventional weapons, there was little appetite for any significant Western military involvement.

That had two important ripple effects. The first was to clear the way for Russia’s military involvement, which ended up rescuing Mr. Assad’s beleaguered regime and turning the war in his favor.

The second was to weaken the prospect of credible Western opposition not just to chemical weapons, but to a wholesale violation by Russian and Syrian forces of decades-old rules governing the protection of noncombatants in conflict zones. The use of barrel bombs against residential areas. The shelling or bombing of schools and hospitals. The deliberate targeting of aid workers.

A key question now is whether the intensified fighting and mounting humanitarian crisis in Idlib will prompt the U.S. and European states to reengage in efforts to end the fighting and influence the future shape of Syria.

CAIRO — An Egyptian court dropped murder charges Saturday against former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak , dealing a stunning blow to the uprising that ousted him in 2011 .

CAIRO — An Egyptian court dropped murder charges Saturday against former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, dealing a stunning blow to the uprising that ousted him in 2011.

Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for almost 30 years, faced charges linked to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the 18-day revolt — known as the January 25 revolution — that ultimately pushed him from power.

Protesters gathered near Tahrir Square — the heart of the nation's 2011 uprising— to denounce the court's decision, state news agency MENA reported.

""The people want to bring down the regime!"" they shouted, using one of the chief slogans in the 18-day, anti-Mubarak uprising.

The verdict was devastating for Egyptians like Ahmed Nage, 26, who was arrested and jailed for two weeks for participating in the 2011 protests. He said two of his friends were killed in the early days of the uprising.

""I feel like our revolution was Photoshopped — not real,"" he said. ""Everything is unfair here in Egypt.""

Although almost 900 people were killed in the unrest, which saw fierce battles between demonstrators and police, the trial was concerned specifically with 239 protesters' deaths.

Ahmed Hassan, a lawyer not involved in the case, said Egypt's judicial system is corrupt and doesn't care about human rights — a result shown in Saturday's ruling.

Others, however, celebrated the verdict. People waved pictures of the former leader and chanted to show their support outside the courtroom where the verdict was issued, according to local media.

He said Mubarak's May 2011 referral to trial by prosecutors ignored the ""implicit"" decision that no criminal charges be filed against him when his security chief and six of his top aides were referred to trial by the same prosecutors two months earlier.

Prosecutors said they will appeal Saturday's verdict, meaning the case will be taken back to a court that will then decide whether or not due process was observed, said Hisham Kassem, a Cairo-based political analyst. If the court finds due process was observed, the verdict will hold. If not, the court will retry Mubarak and either acquit or sentence him, Kassem said.

In the meantime, it remains to be seen when Mubarak will walk free. While he was sentenced to three years in a separate case for corruption, he may have already served enough time depending on which months or years will be credited toward that sentence.

""It's still not clear,"" Kassem said. ""There are people saying he should be released in a few days and others are saying he has another year.""

Mubarak isn't the only former Egyptian president who has been jailed: The Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi, who was elected president in 2012, was swept into prison last year after also being ousted.

Since Morsi's overthrow, military-backed authorities have been in charge, carrying out a widespread crackdown on political opposition.

Cairo ( CNN ) -- Bloodshed intermingled with blood oaths early Wednesday in Egypt .
Opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsy clashed violently at Cairo University , killing at least 16 people and wounding 200 more late Tuesday and early Wednesday , according to the state-run EgyNews agency .
Egypt 's army `` will sacrifice our blood , '' its leaders vowed Wednesday to defend the country just hours after President Mohamed Morsy refused to bow to an ultimatum they issued two days before : Find a solution to the deadly unrest sweeping the country or be pushed aside .
The statement posted on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces came as the clock ticked on the military 's plan to suspend Egypt 's constitution , dissolve the Islamist-led parliament and sideline the president , if Morsy does not find a way to end the unrest , military sources told Arab media and Reuters .
`` We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist , extremist or fool , '' said the statement , which was titled `` The Final Hours . ''
The military has given Morsy until 4 p.m. local time ( 10 a.m . ET ) to come up with a power-sharing agreement or face a military solution , the sources said .
Morsy refused to bow to the ultimatum , setting the stage for a possible showdown .
In a televised speech late Tuesday , Morsy declared he was elected president in balloting that was free and representative of the will of the people .
`` The people of Egypt gave me the mandate for president . They chose me in a free election . The people created a constitution which requires me to stay with the constitution , '' he said . `` I have no choice but to bear responsibility for the Egyptian constitution . ''
The conflict pits Morsy 's supporters -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- against an opposition angered by what they say is the president 's failure to take steps to improve conditions more than two years after a popular revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak .
Morsy gave no indication of stepping down , sharing power or calling early elections , saying he was calling on the military to withdraw its ultimatum and return to its rightful work .
In Morsy 's place , the military has said it would install an interim council , made up mainly of civilians , until a new constitution can be drafted and a new president elected , the sources said .
It was unclear what steps the military would take given Morsy 's refusal to meet its Wednesday evening deadline . The military has previously stopped short of saying that it was suggesting a coup .

The steps could include reducing the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in his Cabinet and calling early presidential and parliamentary elections , a source close to highly placed members of Egypt 's leadership told CNN .
The news came as reports surfaced of clashes between anti-Morsy protesters and Morsy 's supporters in Cairo where anti-government demonstrators took to the streets for the third consecutive day calling for the country 's first democratically elected president to step down .

Violent clashes

The news came as reports surfaced of clashes between anti-Morsy protesters and Morsy's supporters in Cairo where anti-government demonstrators took to the streets for the third consecutive day calling for the country's first democratically elected president to step down.

Conflicting casualty reports Tuesday afternoon and into the evening put the death toll across Egypt anywhere from two to seven people killed and 144 wounded, according to Arab media and sources. CNN could not confirm the casualty counts.

Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy

On Facebook, Morsy's Islamist-backed Freedom and Justice Party called for several nationwide rallies to support the leader. Thousands of his supporters poured into the streets in a Cairo suburb and at Cairo University.

Clashes were reported in at least one Cairo suburb between anti-government demonstrators and pro-Morsy protesters, according to Arab media.

Anti-Morsy protesters have gathered in huge numbers outside a presidential palace where Morsy has been working in recent days. They also have taken to other main squares in cities nationwide.

It was not clear whether Morsy was in the palace.

The anti-government group Tamarod, or ""rebel,"" said in a posting on its Twitter account that Morsy ""has no option but to leave"" along with the prime minister and the Shura Council, the upper house of parliament.

In the face of the anti-government protests, which began over the weekend, five ministers announced their resignations Monday. The latest was Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.

Governments issue warnings against travel to Egypt

Thousands demonstrate

Demonstrations continued Tuesday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where thousands of anti-Morsy protesters had massed, cheering as Apache helicopters buzzed the crowd.

The U.S. Embassy in Cairo, which has been closed since June 30, will remain closed on Wednesday.

The UK was warning against all but essential travel to Egypt, and Canada said it was closing its embassy until further notice ""for security reasons.""

Morsy has few friends as deadline looms

Morsy's failings

Morsy, a U.S.-educated Islamist, was elected Egypt's president in June 2012, but critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian during his year in power.

And he has failed to revive Egypt's economy, which crashed when the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak drove tourists away.

That has disaffected many of his supporters among Egypt's poor and middle classes, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics.

""That some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized Egypt is a year after the election of Morsy,"" Gerges said. ""Think of the millions of people who cheered Morsy after his election. Think of the millions of Egyptians who pinned their hopes on Morsy.

""A year later, now, the millions of Egyptians who cheered for Morsy are saying he must go.""

Gerges questioned Morsy's ability to continue to lead but said he doubted the military would depose him. Such a move ""would plunge Egypt into a greater legal, political and institutional crisis,"" he said.

The military will want to see the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood reduced in government and in the constitution, Gerges said.

Mubarak had long repressed the Islamic political movement, but it is now the nation's most powerful political force.

Anti-government demonstrators say they have collected 17 million signatures -- 4 million more than the number who voted Morsy into the presidency -- calling for him to go.

The opposition comprises various groups and loose coalitions, some of which are loyal to the ousted Mubarak government, while others want the army to intervene.

AbdulMawgoud Dardery, a former member of parliament and a Muslim Brotherhood representative, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" that the military could be an ""honest broker"" in a national dialogue.

""It failed in the previous five elections we had in Egypt since the revolution, and they don't want to fail a sixth time,"" he said. ""That's why they're going to street politics.""

Kerry and Lavrov met with U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi about the potential for a new Geneva peace conference , while a short distance away American and Russian chemical weapons experts were huddled in a hotel to haggle over technical details critical to a deal on chemical weapons .
In the background was the lingering threat of a limited U.S. military strike against Syria if President Bashar Assad doesn ’ t hand over his chemical weapons in time .
Brahimi acknowledged the high stakes . He told Kerry and Lavov that their chemical weapons negotiation “ is extremely important in itself and for itself , but it is also extremely important for us who are working with you on trying to bring together the Geneva conference successfully . ”
More than 100,000 people have been killed in two years of civil war . On Friday the international group Human Rights Watch accused the Syrian government and militias fighting on its side of carrying out summary executions that killed at least 248 people in two towns in May .
Kerry , flanked by Lavrov and Brahimi , told reporters after an hourlong meeting that the chances for a second peace conference in Geneva will require success first with the chemical weapons talks , which have been “ constructive ” so far .

He said that document “ means that the Syrian parties must reach mutual consent on the transitional governing organ , which would come with full executive authority . And the communique also says that all groups of Syrian society must be represented . ”
When the chemical weapons talks began Thursday , Kerry bluntly rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a “ standard process ” by turning over information rather than weapons — and nothing immediately . The American diplomat said that was not acceptable .

If accepted as complete, Syria would become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention 30 days later, Haq said.

Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations had said that as of Thursday when it submitted the documents his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons.

Assad, in an interview with Russia’s Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the U.S. halted threats of military action.

At a meeting in Kyrgyzstan on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Syria’s efforts have demonstrated its good faith.

“I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,” Putin said.

“I would say if the vote were today, it would probably be a no vote,” New York Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told “Fox News Sunday.”

The comment underscored the risk Obama took in deciding over the weekend to seek approval from Congress, a step King argues he didn't need to take.



Kerry told “Fox News Sunday” that he couldn’t imagine Congress would “turn its back” on Israel or other U.S. allies in the region and on the Syrians slaughtered in the Aug. 21 chemical weapon attack, allegedly ordered by President Bashar al-Assad.

“I can't contemplate that Congress would turn its back on all of that responsibility,” Kerry said. “I don’t believe Congress will do that.”

A bipartisan group of senators is preparing to propose new sanctions against Iran . News reports on the bill prompted that country 's foreign minister to warn such a step would kill the nuclear deal negotiated last month aimed at curbing Tehran 's uranium enrichment program .
`` The entire deal is dead , '' Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told TIME Magazine in an interview conducted Saturday and published Monday . `` We do not like to negotiate under duress .

The sanctions would permit Iran to develop nuclear power for commercial purposes , so long as the development is monitored by the international community .

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday that imposing new sanctions on Iran , even those that are delayed , would be counter productive and could `` unravel the unity '' of the six world powers working to implement the deal .
`` It could certainly put the negotiations that we have all worked so hard on that we believe is the best chance we ’ ve had in a decade to achieve a peaceful outcome at risk , '' Psaki told reporters .
Psaki said Secretary of State John Kerry will make an appeal against passing new sanctions during a hearing Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee .

The Obama administration estimates relief from some sanctions in exchange for a temporary pause in Iran 's nuclear enrichment program will amount to just $ 7 billion , a meager amount for a nation of nearly 80 million people — it 's less than one month 's worth of Iran 's oil production and just 7 percent of Iran 's overseas cash that remains frozen under the sanctions .","Secretary of State John Kerry is under pressure to convince Congress to hold off on new sanctions legislation against Iran, as he prepares to testify Tuesday amid a renewed effort in the Senate to turn the screws on Tehran.

(+video)",2013-08-05,Howard Lafranchi,"The killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 and the absence of any Al Qaeda-hatched terrorist attacks on US soil since 9/11 may have lulled Americans into dismissing Al Qaeda as a bygone threat .
But the State Department ’ s extension Sunday of the closings of nearly a dozen US embassies and consulates across the Middle East – with the addition to the list of several diplomatic facilities in Africa – plus an increasingly specific focus on Al Qaeda ’ s affiliate in Yemen as the central source of the current threat , have many terrorism experts cautioning that claims of the terrorist organization ’ s retreat and even demise were premature .
A list of factors – from the post-Arab Spring chaos in the Middle East to the Obama administration ’ s successful but much-hated drone-strike wars in Pakistan and Yemen – have led to what these experts say is certainly a different but no less lethal Al Qaeda than the one that attacked the US on its soil 12 years ago .
“ Those who have been claiming Al Qaeda has been defeated or is on its death bed either have bad analysis or have been dishonest with the American people , ” says Bill Roggio , editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ’ Long War Journal , which tracks and analyzes what it calls the “ global war on terror . ”
Citing the regions where Al Qaeda has active affiliates , and which in many cases even the US government says are expanding in size and reach , Mr. Roggio adds , “ How can you have a group that ’ s expanding its footprint and is adding fighters where it ’ s established , and say it ’ s being defeated ? ”
Others say there is no doubt that the “ old ” Al Qaeda with its core of leadership in Pakistan has been “ depleted ” in recent years . But they add that whatever setbacks the group has suffered at its center have been largely offset by the opportunities that opened up elsewhere as a result of upheaval across the Middle East and North Africa .
“ The Arab Spring has engendered a lot of chaos across the Arab world and broader Middle East , and Al Qaeda thrives on chaos , ” says Bruce Riedel , a leading terrorism analyst who is director of the Brookings Institution ’ s Intelligence Project .
“ Since the first sparks of the Arab Spring two and a half years ago , we ’ ve seen a number of the region ’ s authoritarian regimes come tumbling down , ” says Mr. Riedel , who was a senior terrorism adviser to the last four presidents . Al Qaeda affiliates “ weren ’ t able to operate in the old police states of the Arab world , ” he says . But pointing to Syria , Iraq , Libya , Yemen , and even Egypt , Riedel adds , “ Now we ’ re seeing that they are . ”
Riedel says he took particular note of the recent large jailbreaks by Al Qaeda prisoners in Iraq , Pakistan , and Libya , and adds that such actions in rapid succession , coming on top of the past month ’ s spike in Al Qaeda-originating violence in Iraq and successes in Syria , can ’ t help but suggest Al Qaeda ’ s resurgence .
Still , such examples have led some terrorism experts to conclude that the new Al Qaeda affiliates are focused on local insurgencies and local goals – establishing strict Islamist states in Syria , Iraq , and Yemen , for example – and have retrenched from the “ old ” Al Qaeda ’ s quest to strike the US and other Western powers at home .
But Riedel and others say it would be a grave mistake to draw that conclusion .
“ I think we have to take Al Qaeda ’ s leadership and the leaders of the affiliates at their word , and reading what they say , they say they have a global agenda , ” says Riedel . He also cites last January ’ s deadly attack by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) on an Algerian gas plant . One of AQIM ’ s reasons for attacking the plant was the large number of Western workers there , he says .
The Long War Journal ’ s Roggio notes that it was less than four years ago that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) dispatched a terrorist who attempted to detonate a bomb in his underwear on a flight over Detroit . “ Had that bomb gone off over Detroit , ” Roggio says , “ would we even be having this conversation about whether or not Al Qaeda still wants to attack the US ? ”
Some terrorism experts point to the closings of US diplomatic facilities across the Middle East and parts of Africa and cite that as evidence that a weakened Al Qaeda has of necessity pulled back to attempting to hit targets in the region where it remains active . But Roggio responds to such arguments by citing Al Qaeda ’ s track record – in particular between the group ’ s first attempt at a strike on the World Trade Center in 1993 , and the attack of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ If you look at the eight-year time lag between the two World Trade Center attacks , you can see by what they were doing that they weren ’ t pulling back from attacking US interests , ” he says . The eight-year period included the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden , and the August 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa .
But the second ( and much more elaborate ) attack on the World Trade Center proves that Al Qaeda never gave up on that goal and used the eight years in between to refine its plan of attack , he says .
Roggio cautions that a similar “ if-at-first-you-don ’ t-succeed ” motivation could be part of efforts by a Saudi citizen thought to be AQAP ’ s chief bomb maker to devise ingenious new ways to get bombs ( and suicide bombers ) past the best security to the heart of key US interests .
The Saudi , Ibrahim al-Asiri , whose fingerprints were found on the “ underwear bomb ” that failed to detonate over Detroit , is thought to be experimenting with new failsafe bombs – to be surgically implanted in the suicide bomber , for example – and to be training a class of bomb makers to take over for him should the US succeed in taking him out with a drone strike ( The US once believed it had succeeded , with a 2011 strike ) .

Brookings ’ s Riedel sounds another cautionary note for Americans who might have thought Al Qaeda was a threat of the past . He notes that much of the success at “ depleting ” Al Qaeda ’ s core leadership in Pakistan is a result of US pressure – but he notes that whatever success the US has had could quickly be reversed if that pressure subsides as a result of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from next-door Afghanistan at the end of 2014 .

President Putin, the United States is exceptional among the world’s nations.



This is not the usual jingoism you may hear from the citizen of any nation – the type of jingoism, incidentally, in which Russia excels.



Instead, Mr. President, take it from someone whose family fled your country over 30 years ago because of religious and ethnic persecution.

My parents and I arrived in the United States with $90 in our pockets, speaking not a word of English and stripped of any nation’s citizenship. And yet we came here because the United States is exceptional in the opportunities it has provided to generations of those who arrived at its ports with nothing but the clothes on their backs and the drive to succeed as Americans.

[pullquote]

We came here because life in the Soviet Union, which you served so faithfully as a KGB colonel, was incompatible with basic human dignity.

We came here because generations of our family had been killed, abused and disenfranchised simply because of our religious identity.

More On This...

To us, what was exceptional was that a world power would provide a new life for us without asking about our ethnicity, whether we were members of the right political party or whether we associated with those who spoke out against the government.

That the United States asked us none of these things is what makes it exceptional – and what made the former Soviet Union, which you served so proudly, unexceptional in its generations-long oppressive nature.



There is not, coincidentally, a mass movement of any oppressed ethnic or religious minority to flee the United States, to Russia or anywhere else. That is what makes this nation exceptional – and what makes the recent history of yours troublesome.



You, the Butcher of Grozny, wrote in the New York Times Thursday that, “we must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.”

That point is well taken, but it is delivered by a man who is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Chechens, who provoked an ethnic war in Georgia and who decried the collapse of the Soviet Union “as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.



That “catastrophe,” of course, put an end to a regime that was responsible for slaughtering tens of millions of its own people and for invading neighboring countries without the United Nations approval you so arduously defend today.

You, as the architect of the Soviet Union’s successor, continue to persecute political opponents, dissenting journalists and many others.



You defend the regime of Bashar al-Assad because Syria is nothing more than your client state, which you arm with chemicals and weapons and which allows you the room to maneuver in the same Great Game where your Soviet predecessors excelled.

Your op-ed in the New York Times invokes a God you did everything to suppress during your rise in the KGB.

You remonstrate against the extremists who could fan out across the world after fighting in Syria but do nothing to reflect upon the fact that thousands of Chechens have been radicalized due to the oppression and brutality you have visited upon them for years.



There is nothing exceptional in your comments, Mr. President. They come from the song sheet you and your predecessors have used before to wage war while preaching peace.

The landmark deal between Iran and world powers was agreed last July.

Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful, but opponents of the deal - such as some US Republicans - say it does not do enough to ensure the country cannot develop a nuclear bomb.

The US Secretary of State John Kerry has ordered that US nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran be lifted.

Speaking in Vienna where he had been holding talks with his Iranian counterpart, Mr Kerry said Iran had ""undertaken significant steps"" which many people ""doubted would ever come to pass"".

The US said it was offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation.

Mr Kerry said said he was ""very happy to say that as we speak five Americans have been released from custody and they should be on their way home to their families shortly"".

A fifth American, Matthew Trevithick, was also released on Saturday.

President Barack Obama would give more details of the releases later, Mr Kerry said.

The IAEA said it had installed a device at the Natanz plant to monitor Iran's uranium enrichment activities in real time, in order to verify that uranium enrichment levels were kept at up to 3.67% as agreed in the deal with world powers.

The organisation's head, Yukiya Amano, is to visit Tehran on Sunday for meetings with President Rouhani and other officials.

What is the nuclear deal?

In July 2015, Iran agreed a landmark nuclear deal with six world powers to limit its sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.

What does Iran stand to gain?

The sanctions have cost Iran more than more than $160bn (£102bn) in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade.

An attack method open to all

Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent

This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations.

The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran?

The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign.

The Saudi Air Force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over.

Drone technology - albeit of varying degrees of sophistication - is available to all; from the US to China, Israel and Iran... and from the Houthis to Hezbolllah.

Markets await news from key facilities

Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott

Aramco ranks as the world's largest oil business and these facilities are significant.

The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size.

But whether this will have an impact on the oil price come Monday will depend on just how extensive the damage is. Markets now have the weekend to digest information from Aramco and assess the long-term impact.

According to Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, any reaction on Monday morning is likely to be muted, as markets are less worried about supply than demand at the moment, due to slower global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China.

However, there are concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's oil supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz.

Who are the Houthis?

The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition.

Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels.

The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia.

Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"".

Difficult issues remain on the table as the world 's most powerful diplomats meet in Switzerland with Iranian nuclear negotiators , Kerry told CNN on Monday .
`` We are working very hard to work those through . We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow . We are working with a view to get something done , '' he said . `` There is a little more light there today , but ​there are still some tricky issues . Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow . ''
Negotiators have set Tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal . A comprehensive deal , including technical additions , is supposed to be negotiated by June 30 .
World powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years . In exchange , Iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy .
Kerry 's comments to CNN came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in Lausanne , Switzerland , made headlines .
The assertion : Iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb .
On Sunday , an Iranian negotiator told journalists that Tehran would not send fissile material to Russia , which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb-making materials out of reach .
`` The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to send them abroad . ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad , '' Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said .

But on Monday , a senior U.S. State Department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down .
Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and Iran has made the comments many times before , the official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports .
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks ' progress earlier Monday , saying that the diplomats were `` narrowing down '' their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points .
`` These marathon-like negotiations have reached the final stage , '' he said .
Things have been tense in Lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms , with talks snagged on three important points :

Difficult issues remain on the table as the world's most powerful diplomats meet in Switzerland with Iranian nuclear negotiators, Kerry told CNN on Monday.

""We are working very hard to work those through. We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow. We are working with a view to get something done,"" he said. ""There is a little more light there today, but ​there are still some tricky issues. Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow.""

Negotiators have set Tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal. A comprehensive deal, including technical additions, is supposed to be negotiated by June 30.

World powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years . In exchange, Iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy.

Kerry's comments to CNN came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, made headlines.

The assertion: Iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb.

On Sunday, an Iranian negotiator told journalists that Tehran would not send fissile material to Russia, which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb-making materials out of reach.

""The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to send them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,"" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said.

But on Monday, a senior U.S. State Department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down.

Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, the official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks' progress earlier Monday, saying that the diplomats were ""narrowing down"" their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points.

""These marathon-like negotiations have reached the final stage,"" he said.

Three tense points

Things have been tense in Lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms, with talks snagged on three important points:

• How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement.

• How quickly crushing U.N. sanctions will go away.

• Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the deal.

""There cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions,"" the diplomat said.

Hardline disruption

In the background, a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again. Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the deal he believes is taking shape.

""This agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse,"" he said after a meeting in Israel with visiting U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Netanyahu also attacked Iran for its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have overtaken many parts of that country.

Iran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed. But diplomats says it's not so simple.

Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, but sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated.

Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension.

Better, faster centrifuges

Iran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. New machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines.

U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon.

Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15-year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, which would be relaxed over the last five.

This isn't the final deadline

While the focus this week is on the March 31 deadline, it's important to note it isn't the final deadline.

Even if a pact is reached Tuesday, it's unclear what form it would take, and the United States and Iran have varying needs.

The parties are seeking to reach what's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal.

It was a rare defeat in Britain , where prime ministers are used to winning parliamentary support for their major foreign policy initiatives .
But it was also an unexpected blow to the US , which has for decades counted on Britain to serve by its military side , from Afghanistan and Iraq to , more recently , Libya .
Mr. Cameron accepted the defeat , by 285 to 272 votes , of a measure that would have paved the way to British military intervention in Syria after claims that the government used chemical weapons to gas citizens near Damascus last week .
`` I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons , but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons , ¨ Cameron said last night . `` It is very clear tonight that while the House has not passed a motion , it is clear to me that the British parliament , reflecting the views of the British people , does not want to see British military action – I get that and the government will act accordingly . ''
British lawmakers revealed deep skepticism about the current evidence over who exactly used chemical weapons that killed upwards of 350 people in last week 's attack in Syria , reflecting the fallout from intelligence failures in Iraq a decade ago . At that time , claims of weapons of mass destruction instigated the war , but ultimately were found to be false . The European debate on Syria a decade later shows how the Iraq intervention continues to guide thinking on military affairs and impact US-European military cooperation , especially with Britain and France .
But for all the similarities with Iraq , there are significant differences as well , including the US ambivalence about getting involved , the scale of the attack , and the evidence at hand . The impact of US-British relations , therefore , even if the two powers diverge on Syria , might be limited in the long term .
`` Usually the Americans almost automatically count on the British to be on their side for their actions , and the fact that it is not going to be the case this time ... will probably strain a little bit the relationship , '' says Vivien Pertusot , head of the Brussels office for the French Institute of International Relations .
But , he adds , the US is also not convinced of the merits of a military strike , and the stakes are smaller . `` In the long run it will not impact that much the relationship because we are not talking about a large scale war , that the American government is betting its entire administration on , '' he says . `` We are talking about a limited airstrike , for a limited time . ''
It is clear that the experience of Iraq in 2003 , which was launched with faulty evidence and turned into a years-long quagmire , loomed over the parliamentary debate in Britain . `` The Iraq war is still in everyone 's minds , '' says Mr. Pertusot . `` The fact that today we are not entirely sure who did what , or who used what , … a lot of people can associate very easily that this resembles what we were facing in 2003 . They voted in favor at the time , they learned afterwards that it was a mistake , and they don´t want to make the same mistake again . ''
But Iraq acts far less as a cautionary tale in the foreign policy debate in France , which was the loudest critic to intervention to Iraq in 2003 .
`` I think that the ghosts of Iraq are still hovering over Britain more than France because Britain was heavily implicated , '' says Karim Bitar , a senior research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris . `` France opposed the Iraq war in 2003 which sort of frees it psychologically . It is more free to take a stance and analyze the situation than make analogies with Iraq . ''
And in many cases , the analogies are only surface-deep . The evidence that chemical weapons were employed in Syria appears more concrete , Mr. Bitar notes , than the more circumstantial case the US made about Iraq in an attempt to convince the international community that weapons of mass destruction existed . And the US has tried to stay out of the Syrian conflict for two years , while in Iraq , American President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were `` hellbent on going to war , '' says Bitar . And this time , Western leaders are proposing a limited , directly targeted strike on Syria .
`` The scale of intervention is completely different , '' he says . `` In Iraq it was a full-fledged land invasion . ''
The British parliament 's obstruction of military intervention appears to have a limited impact on France 's ultimate decision to engage in punitive strikes against Syria . It puts France in the uncomfortable position of standing side-by-side with the Americans . `` We have never been at that position , alone with Americans on the same boat without anyone else , '' says Pertusot .
But he says that is unlikely to sway the French position – even if recently France has said it needs time to reflect and will await a report by United Nations investigators , due in a few days , before it makes a decision to act .
French President François Hollande said in Le Monde today , when asked if France would act if Britain does not : `` Yes . Each country is sovereign to participate or not in an operation . That is valid for Britain as it is for France . '' The two main parties in France have backed his position , even if fringe groups and the public have voiced opposition to intervention , says Bitar .
Daniel Levy , the director for the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations who has criticized Cameron for acting hastily on Syria , says that he believes that part of the call for intervention at the top echelons of French and British power is the sensitivity towards waning military influence in Europe overall . `` Nervous that Europe does n't have hard power , they [ France and Britain ] occasionally like to show they are a world power that can be useful to America , '' he says .
Indeed , in Europe , it is only the UK and France that have aggressively considered military action . They are the only two countries with the ambitions and ability to engage in military conflict . Germany has the power but has long been reluctant to employ it . Today , German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's office said it was not considering military engagement in Syria – instead , it has pressed for a political solution .
`` There has been no request to us for a military commitment , and a German military commitment has never been considered by the government , '' Ms. Merkel 's spokesman , Steffen Seibert , told reporters .
But , at least in Britain , Cameron failed to grasp the national mood .

America 's top diplomat met earlier Thursday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah over Saturday 's attack on a crucial oil processing facility and oil field , which halved the kingdom 's oil production . Yemen 's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed the attack , but the U.S. alleges Iran carried out the assault .
`` The U.S. stands with # SaudiArabia and supports its right to defend itself , '' Pompeo tweeted Wednesday .
TRUMP , IN WAKE OF SAUDI OIL ATTACK , SAYS ' I DO N'T WANT WAR WITH ANYBODY '
Pompeo , speaking from Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , on Wednesday , added that even if the `` fraudulent claims '' of responsibility by the Yemen Houthi rebels were true , `` it does n't change the fingerprints of the [ Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ] as having put at risk the global energy supply . ''
Pompeo 's remarks in Saudi Arabia also came hours after President Trump tweeted that he had ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “ substantially increase sanctions ” on Iran , amid escalating tensions between the two countries .
Earlier this week , Trump said it was `` looking like '' Iran was responsible for the bombing but did not publicly accuse Tehran of the attack .
“ Well , it ’ s looking that way , ” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked if Iran was responsible . “ We ’ ll let you know definitively. ” He added : “ That ’ s being checked out right now . ”
At a press conference Wednesday , the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that military spokesman Col. Turki Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack . He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north . Yemen is to the south of Saudi Arabia .
Eighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault , Al-Malki said , with three missiles failing to make their targets . He said the cruise missiles had a range of 435 miles , meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen . That opinion was shared by weapons experts who spoke to The Associated Press .
`` This is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure , '' Al-Malki said , referring to Iran 's Revolutionary Guards .
He added : `` This attack did not originate from Yemen , despite Iran 's best effort to make it appear so .

Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed the attack, but the U.S. alleges Iran carried out the assault.

""The U.S. stands with #SaudiArabia and supports its right to defend itself,"" Pompeo tweeted Wednesday.

TRUMP, IN WAKE OF SAUDI OIL ATTACK, SAYS 'I DON'T WANT WAR WITH ANYBODY'

Pompeo, speaking from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday, added that even if the ""fraudulent claims"" of responsibility by the Yemen Houthi rebels were true, ""it doesn't change the fingerprints of the [Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] as having put at risk the global energy supply.""

He called it an ""act of war.""

Pompeo's remarks in Saudi Arabia also came hours after President Trump tweeted that he had ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “substantially increase sanctions” on Iran, amid escalating tensions between the two countries.

Earlier this week, Trump said it was ""looking like"" Iran was responsible for the bombing but did not publicly accuse Tehran of the attack.

“Well, it’s looking that way,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked if Iran was responsible. “We’ll let you know definitively.” He added: “That’s being checked out right now.”

At a press conference Wednesday, the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that military spokesman Col. Turki Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack. He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north. Yemen is to the south of Saudi Arabia.

Eighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Al-Malki said, with three missiles failing to make their targets. He said the cruise missiles had a range of 435 miles, meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen. That opinion was shared by weapons experts who spoke to The Associated Press.

""This is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure,"" Al-Malki said, referring to Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

He added: ""This attack did not originate from Yemen, despite Iran's best effort to make it appear so.""

In 2012 , Obama touted that promise as complete ( one of the only campaign promises he actually kept ) and critics warned leaving Iraq without a residual U.S. force would result in a power vacuum and vulnerable state . Now as the country falls apart and the radical Islamic State army continues its march unchallenged in Iraq , Obama is claiming he was n't the one who made the decision to pull U.S. combat troops out of the country and that claims to the contrary are `` bogus and wrong . ''
Q Mr. President , do you have any second thoughts about pulling all ground troops out of Iraq ? And does it give you pause as the U.S. -- is it doing the same thing in Afghanistan ?
THE PRESIDENT : What I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up , as if this was my decision . Under the previous administration , we had turned over the country to a sovereign , democratically elected Iraqi government . In order for us to maintain troops in Iraq , we needed the invitation of the Iraqi government and we needed assurances that our personnel would be immune from prosecution if , for example , they were protecting themselves and ended up getting in a firefight with Iraqis , that they wouldn ’ t be hauled before an Iraqi judicial system .
And the Iraqi government , based on its political considerations , in part because Iraqis were tired of a U.S. occupation , declined to provide us those assurances . And on that basis , we left . We had offered to leave additional troops . So when you hear people say , do you regret , Mr. President , not leaving more troops , that presupposes that I would have overridden this sovereign government that we had turned the keys back over to and said , you know what , you ’ re democratic , you ’ re sovereign , except if I decide that it ’ s good for you to keep 10,000 or 15,000 or 25,000 Marines in your country , you don ’ t have a choice -- which would have kind of run contrary to the entire argument we were making about turning over the country back to Iraqis , an argument not just made by me , but made by the previous administration .
So let ’ s just be clear : The reason that we did not have a follow-on force in Iraq was because the Iraqis were -- a majority of Iraqis did not want U.S. troops there , and politically they could not pass the kind of laws that would be required to protect our troops in Iraq .
Having said all that , if in fact the Iraqi government behaved the way it did over the last five , six years , where it failed to pass legislation that would reincorporate Sunnis and give them a sense of ownership ; if it had targeted certain Sunni leaders and jailed them ; if it had alienated some of the Sunni tribes that we had brought back in during the so-called Awakening that helped us turn the tide in 2006 -- if they had done all those things and we had had troops there , the country wouldn ’ t be holding together either . The only difference would be we ’ d have a bunch of troops on the ground that would be vulnerable . And however many troops we had , we would have to now be reinforcing , I ’ d have to be protecting them , and we ’ d have a much bigger job . And probably , we would end up having to go up again in terms of the number of grounds troops to make sure that those forces were not vulnerable .
So that entire analysis is bogus and is wrong . But it gets frequently peddled around here by folks who oftentimes are trying to defend previous policies that they themselves made .
Right , pulling all U.S. troops from Iraq had nothing to do with Obama 's political aspirations and promises . Pretty incredible . On the issue of Obama claiming the Iraqi 's and Maliki `` not wanting U.S. troops there , '' and `` would n't agree to a status of forces agreement , '' Obama hardly tried to get an agreement done in the first place . Obama took the easy way out on the agreement in order to fulfill a campaign promise and to satisfy his base .
Here 's a flashback from 2010 , when Obama took credit for the troop pull-out in Iraq .
Weird .. He took credit for that decision in an Oval Office address in 2010. pic.twitter.com/L5v5Z40G4F — S.M ( @ redsteeze ) August 9 , 2014

President Obama wants to be responsible for what makes him look good in a short term moment and conveniently shoves off the bad and real decision making on everything and everyone else .","In 2008 then Senator Obama campaigned on the promise of ending the war in Iraq and bringing combat troops home. In 2012, Obama touted that promise as complete (one of the only campaign promises he actually kept) and critics warned leaving Iraq without a residual U.S. force would result in a power vacuum and vulnerable state.

THE PRESIDENT: What I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up, as if this was my decision. Under the previous administration, we had turned over the country to a sovereign, democratically elected Iraqi government.

And the Iraqi government, based on its political considerations, in part because Iraqis were tired of a U.S. occupation, declined to provide us those assurances. And on that basis, we left. We had offered to leave additional troops. So when you hear people say, do you regret, Mr. President, not leaving more troops, that presupposes that I would have overridden this sovereign government that we had turned the keys back over to and said, you know what, you’re democratic, you’re sovereign, except if I decide that it’s good for you to keep 10,000 or 15,000 or 25,000 Marines in your country, you don’t have a choice -- which would have kind of run contrary to the entire argument we were making about turning over the country back to Iraqis, an argument not just made by me, but made by the previous administration.



So let’s just be clear: The reason that we did not have a follow-on force in Iraq was because the Iraqis were -- a majority of Iraqis did not want U.S. troops there, and politically they could not pass the kind of laws that would be required to protect our troops in Iraq.



Having said all that, if in fact the Iraqi government behaved the way it did over the last five, six years, where it failed to pass legislation that would reincorporate Sunnis and give them a sense of ownership; if it had targeted certain Sunni leaders and jailed them; if it had alienated some of the Sunni tribes that we had brought back in during the so-called Awakening that helped us turn the tide in 2006 -- if they had done all those things and we had had troops there, the country wouldn’t be holding together either. The only difference would be we’d have a bunch of troops on the ground that would be vulnerable. And however many troops we had, we would have to now be reinforcing, I’d have to be protecting them, and we’d have a much bigger job. And probably, we would end up having to go up again in terms of the number of grounds troops to make sure that those forces were not vulnerable.



So that entire analysis is bogus and is wrong. But it gets frequently peddled around here by folks who oftentimes are trying to defend previous policies that they themselves made.

Right, pulling all U.S. troops from Iraq had nothing to do with Obama's political aspirations and promises. Pretty incredible. On the issue of Obama claiming the Iraqi's and Maliki ""not wanting U.S. troops there,"" and ""wouldn't agree to a status of forces agreement,"" Obama hardly tried to get an agreement done in the first place. Obama took the easy way out on the agreement in order to fulfill a campaign promise and to satisfy his base.

Here's a flashback from 2010, when Obama took credit for the troop pull-out in Iraq.

Weird.. He took credit for that decision in an Oval Office address in 2010. pic.twitter.com/L5v5Z40G4F — S.M (@redsteeze) August 9, 2014

But, the idea that Obama had anything to do with the troop pullout is totally bogus right?

And another from 2011:

You get the point.

President Obama wants to be responsible for what makes him look good in a short term moment and conveniently shoves off the bad and real decision making on everything and everyone else.",www.townhall.com,right,QcvwpscaI4TJnoS6

middle_east,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2015/0122/Saudi-Arabia-s-King-Abdullah-was-incremental-reformer-US-ally-video,"Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah was incremental reformer, US ally",2015-01-22,,"Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah , the powerful U.S. ally who joined Washington 's fight against al-Qaida and sought to modernize the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom with incremental but significant reforms , including nudging open greater opportunities for women , has died , according to Saudi state TV .
More than his guarded and hidebound predecessors , Abdullah assertively threw his oil-rich nation 's weight behind trying to shape the Middle East . His priority was to counter the influence of rival , mainly Shiite Iran wherever it tried to make advances . He and fellow Sunni Arab monarchs also staunchly opposed the Middle East 's wave of pro-democracy uprisings , seeing them as a threat to stability and their own rule .
He backed Sunni Muslim factions against Tehran 's allies in several countries , but in Lebanon for example , the policy failed to stop Iranian-backed Hezbollah from gaining the upper hand . And Tehran and Riyadh 's colliding ambitions stoked proxy conflicts around the region that enflamed Sunni-Shiite hatreds — most horrifically in Syria 's civil war , where the two countries backed opposing sides . Those conflicts in turn hiked Sunni militancy that returned to threaten Saudi Arabia .
And while the king maintained the historically close alliance with Washington , there were frictions as he sought to put those relations on Saudi Arabia 's terms . He was constantly frustrated by Washington 's failure to broker a settlement to the Israel-Palestinian conflict . He also pushed the Obama administration to take a tougher stand against Iran and to more strongly back the mainly Sunni rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad .
Abdullah 's death was announced on Saudi state TV by a presenter who said the king died at 1 a.m. on Friday . His successor was announced as 79-year-old half-brother , Prince Salman , according to a Royal Court statement carried on the Saudi Press Agency . Salman was Abdullah 's crown prince and had recently taken on some of the king 's responsibilities .
Abdullah was born in Riyadh in 1924 , one of the dozens of sons of Saudi Arabia 's founder , King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud . Like all Abdul-Aziz 's sons , Abdullah had only rudimentary education . Tall and heavyset , he felt more at home in the Nejd , the kingdom 's desert heartland , riding stallions and hunting with falcons . His strict upbringing was exemplified by three days he spent in prison as a young man as punishment by his father for failing to give his seat to a visitor , a violation of Bedouin hospitality .
Abdullah was selected as crown prince in 1982 on the day his half-brother Fahd ascended to the throne . The decision was challenged by a full brother of Fahd , Prince Sultan , who wanted the title for himself . But the family eventually closed ranks behind Abdullah to prevent splits .
Abdullah became de facto ruler in 1995 when a stroke incapacitated Fahd . Abdullah was believed to have long rankled at the closeness of the alliance with the United States , and as regent he pressed Washington to withdraw the troops it had deployed in the kingdom since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . The U.S. finally did so in 2003 .
When President George W. Bush came to office , Abdullah again showed his readiness to push against his U.S. allies .
In 2000 , Abdullah convinced the Arab League to approve an unprecedented offer that all Arab states would agree to peace with Israel if it withdrew from lands it captured in 1967 . The next year , he sent his ambassador in Washington to tell the Bush administration that it was too unquestioningly biased in favor of Israel and that the kingdom would from now on pursue its own interests apart from Washington 's . Alarmed by the prospect of a rift , Bush soon after advocated for the first time the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel .
The next month , the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks took place in the United States , and Abdullah had to steer the alliance through the resulting criticism . The kingdom was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers , and many pointed out that the baseline ideology for al-Qaida and other groups stemmed from Saudi Arabia 's Wahhabi interpretation of Islam .
When al-Qaida militants in 2003 began a wave of violence in the kingdom aimed at toppling the monarchy , Abdullah cracked down hard . For the next three years , security forces battled militants , finally forcing them to flee to neighboring Yemen . There , they created a new al-Qaida branch , and Saudi Arabia has played a behind-the-scenes role in fighting it .
The tougher line helped affirm Abdullah 's commitment to fighting al-Qaida . He paid two visits to Bush — in 2002 and 2005 — at his ranch in Crawford , Texas .
When Fahd died in 2005 , Abdullah officially rose to the throne . He then began to more openly push his agenda .
His aim at home was to modernize the kingdom to face the future . One of the world 's largest oil exporters , Saudi Arabia is fabulously wealthy , but there are deep disparities in wealth and a burgeoning youth population in need of jobs , housing and education . More than half the current population of 20 million is under the age of 25 . For Abdullah , that meant building a more skilled workforce and opening up greater room for women to participate . He was a strong supporter of education , building universities at home and increasing scholarships abroad for Saudi students .
Abdullah for the first time gave women seats on the Shura Council , an unelected body that advises the king and government . He promised women would be able to vote and run in 2015 elections for municipal councils , the only elections held in the country . He appointed the first female deputy minister in a 2009 . Two Saudi female athletes competed in the Olympics for the first time in 2012 , and a small handful of women were granted licenses to work as lawyers during his rule .
One of his most ambitious projects was a Western-style university that bears his name , the King AbdullahUniversity of Science and Technology , which opened in 2009 . Men and women share classrooms and study together inside the campus , a major departure in a country where even small talk between the sexes in public can bring a warning from the morality police .
The changes seemed small from the outside but had a powerful resonance . Small splashes of variety opened in the kingdom — color and flash crept into the all-black abayas women must wear in public ; state-run TV started playing music , forbidden for decades ; book fairs opened their doors to women writers and some banned books .
But he treaded carefully in the face of the ultraconservative Wahhabi clerics who hold near total sway over society and , in return , give the Al Saud family 's rule religious legitimacy .
Senior cleric Sheik Saleh al-Lihedan warned against changes that could snap the `` thread between a leader and his people . '' In some cases , Abdullah pushed back : He fired one prominent government cleric who criticized the mixed-gender university . But the king balked at going too far too fast . For example , beyond allowing debate in newspapers , Abdullah did nothing to respond to demands to allow women to drive .
`` He has presided over a country that has inched forward , either on its own or with his leadership , '' said Karen Elliot House , author of `` On Saudi Arabia : Its People , Past , Religion , Fault Lines . ''
`` I do n't think he 's had as much impact as one would hope on trying to create a more moderate version of Islam , '' she said . `` To me , it has not taken inside the country as much as one would hope . ''
And any change was strictly on the royal family 's terms . After the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings in particular , Saudi Arabia clamped down on any dissent . Riot police crushed street demonstrations by Saudi Arabia 's Shiite minority . Dozens of activists were detained , many of them tried under a sweeping counterterrorism law by an anti-terrorism court Abdullah created . Authorities more closely monitored social media , where anger over corruption and unemployment — and jokes about the aging monarchy — are rife .
Regionally , perhaps Abdullah 's biggest priority was to confront Iran , the Shiite powerhouse across the Gulf .
Worried about Tehran 's nuclear program , Abdullah told the United States in 2008 to consider military action to `` cut off the head of the snake '' and prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon , according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic memo .
In Lebanon , Abdullah backed Sunni allies against the Iranian-backed Shiite guerrilla group Hezbollah in a proxy conflict that flared repeatedly into potentially destabilizing violence . Saudi Arabia was also deeply opposed to longtime Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , whom it considered a tool of Iran oppressing Iraq 's Sunni Muslim minority .
In Syria , Abdullah stepped indirectly indirectly into the civil war that emerged after 2011 . He supported and armed rebels battling to overthrow President Bashar Assad , Iran 's top Arab ally , and pressed the Obama administration to do the same . Iran 's allies Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militias rushed to back Assad , and the resulting conflict has left hundreds of thousands dead and driven millions of Syrians from their homes .
From the multiple conflicts , Sunni-Shiite hatreds around the region took on a life of their own , fueling Sunni militancy . Syria 's war helped give birth to the Islamic State group , which burst out to take over large parts of Syria and Iraq . Fears of the growing militancy prompted Abdullah to commit Saudi airpower to a U.S.-led coalition fighting the extremists .
Toby Matthiesen , author of `` Sectarian Gulf : Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , and the Arab Spring That Was n't , '' saidAbdullah was not `` particularly sectarian in a way that he hated Shiites for religious reasons . ... There are other senior members of the ruling family much more sectarian . '' But , he said , `` Saudi Arabia plays a huge role in fueling sectarian conflict . ''
Abdullah had more than 30 children from around a dozen wives .

There, they created a new al-Qaida branch, and Saudi Arabia has played a behind-the-scenes role in fighting it.

The tougher line helped affirm Abdullah's commitment to fighting al-Qaida. He paid two visits to Bush — in 2002 and 2005 — at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.

When Fahd died in 2005, Abdullah officially rose to the throne. He then began to more openly push his agenda.

His aim at home was to modernize the kingdom to face the future. One of the world's largest oil exporters, Saudi Arabia is fabulously wealthy, but there are deep disparities in wealth and a burgeoning youth population in need of jobs, housing and education. More than half the current population of 20 million is under the age of 25. For Abdullah, that meant building a more skilled workforce and opening up greater room for women to participate. He was a strong supporter of education, building universities at home and increasing scholarships abroad for Saudi students.

Abdullah for the first time gave women seats on the Shura Council, an unelected body that advises the king and government. He promised women would be able to vote and run in 2015 elections for municipal councils, the only elections held in the country. He appointed the first female deputy minister in a 2009. Two Saudi female athletes competed in the Olympics for the first time in 2012, and a small handful of women were granted licenses to work as lawyers during his rule.

Men and women share classrooms and study together inside the campus, a major departure in a country where even small talk between the sexes in public can bring a warning from the morality police.

The changes seemed small from the outside but had a powerful resonance. Small splashes of variety opened in the kingdom — color and flash crept into the all-black abayas women must wear in public; state-run TV started playing music, forbidden for decades; book fairs opened their doors to women writers and some banned books.

But he treaded carefully in the face of the ultraconservative Wahhabi clerics who hold near total sway over society and, in return, give the Al Saud family's rule religious legitimacy.

Senior cleric Sheik Saleh al-Lihedan warned against changes that could snap the ""thread between a leader and his people."" In some cases, Abdullah pushed back: He fired one prominent government cleric who criticized the mixed-gender university. But the king balked at going too far too fast. For example, beyond allowing debate in newspapers, Abdullah did nothing to respond to demands to allow women to drive.

""He has presided over a country that has inched forward, either on its own or with his leadership,"" said Karen Elliot House, author of ""On Saudi Arabia: Its People, Past, Religion, Fault Lines.""

""I don't think he's had as much impact as one would hope on trying to create a more moderate version of Islam,"" she said. ""To me, it has not taken inside the country as much as one would hope.""

And any change was strictly on the royal family's terms. After the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings in particular, Saudi Arabia clamped down on any dissent. Riot police crushed street demonstrations by Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority. Dozens of activists were detained, many of them tried under a sweeping counterterrorism law by an anti-terrorism court Abdullah created. Authorities more closely monitored social media, where anger over corruption and unemployment — and jokes about the aging monarchy — are rife.

Regionally, perhaps Abdullah's biggest priority was to confront Iran, the Shiite powerhouse across the Gulf.

Worried about Tehran's nuclear program, Abdullah told the United States in 2008 to consider military action to ""cut off the head of the snake"" and prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic memo.

In Lebanon, Abdullah backed Sunni allies against the Iranian-backed Shiite guerrilla group Hezbollah in a proxy conflict that flared repeatedly into potentially destabilizing violence. Saudi Arabia was also deeply opposed to longtime Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whom it considered a tool of Iran oppressing Iraq's Sunni Muslim minority.

In Syria, Abdullah stepped indirectly indirectly into the civil war that emerged after 2011. He supported and armed rebels battling to overthrow President Bashar Assad, Iran's top Arab ally, and pressed the Obama administration to do the same. Iran's allies Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militias rushed to back Assad, and the resulting conflict has left hundreds of thousands dead and driven millions of Syrians from their homes.

From the multiple conflicts, Sunni-Shiite hatreds around the region took on a life of their own, fueling Sunni militancy. Syria's war helped give birth to the Islamic State group, which burst out to take over large parts of Syria and Iraq. Fears of the growing militancy prompted Abdullah to commit Saudi airpower to a U.S.-led coalition fighting the extremists.

Toby Matthiesen, author of ""Sectarian Gulf: Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the Arab Spring That Wasn't,"" saidAbdullah was not ""particularly sectarian in a way that he hated Shiites for religious reasons. ... There are other senior members of the ruling family much more sectarian."" But, he said, ""Saudi Arabia plays a huge role in fueling sectarian conflict.""

Abdullah had more than 30 children from around a dozen wives.

Kirkpatrick, Jodi Rudoren","The deal demonstrated the pragmatism of Egypt ’ s new Islamist president , Mohamed Morsi , who balanced public support for Hamas with a determination to preserve the peace with Israel . But it was unclear whether the agreement would be a turning point or merely a lull in the conflict .
The cease-fire deal was reached only through a final American diplomatic push : Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton conferred for hours with Mr. Morsi and the United Nations secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , at the presidential palace here . Hanging over the talks was the Israeli shock at a Tel Aviv bus bombing — praised by Hamas — that recalled past Palestinian uprisings and raised fears of heavy Israeli retaliation . After false hopes the day before , Western and Egyptian diplomats said they had all but given up hope for a quick end to the violence .
Tellingly , neither Israel nor Hamas was represented in the final talks or the announcement , leaving it in the hands of a singular partnership between their proxies , the United States and Egypt .
There were immediate questions about the durability of the deal . Hamas , which controls Gaza , has in the past not fulfilled less formal cease-fires by failing to halt all missile fire into Israel by breakaway Palestinian militants .
Neither side retreated from threats to resume the conflict if the deal fell through , and both said they had only reluctantly agreed under international pressure . In a televised news conference , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel declared that some Israelis still expected “ a much harsher military operation , and it is very possible we will be compelled to embark on one . ”
But he said that in a telephone conversation with Mr. Obama earlier in the evening , “ I agreed with him that it is worth giving the cease-fire a chance. ” He added that he had reached an undisclosed agreement with Mr. Obama to “ work together against the smuggling of weapons ” to Palestinian militants , for which Mr. Netanyahu blamed Iran .
Khaled Meshal , Hamas ’ s top leader , thanked Iran for its military support in a triumphal news conference in Cairo . “ This is a point on the way to a great defeat for Israel , ” he said . “ Israel failed in all its objectives . ”
He suggested that the West had come to Hamas and its Islamist allies in Egypt pleading for peace . “ The Americans and the Europeans asked the Egyptians , ‘ You have the ear of the resistance , ’ ” he said , using the term Hamas prefers to describe itself and other Palestinian militants fighting the Israeli occupation . “ Egypt did not sell out the resistance as some people have claimed . Egypt understood the demands of the resistance and the Palestinian people . ”
The agreement postponed the resolution of the most contentious issue : Israel ’ s tight restrictions on the border crossings into Gaza under a seven-year-old embargo imposed to thwart Hamas from arming itself . The one-page “ understanding ” regarding the cease-fire called for “ opening the crossing and facilitating the movement of people and transfer of goods , ” but it also said that “ procedures of implementation will be dealt with after 24 hours from the start of the cease-fire . ”

But however fragile the cease-fire may be , the deal itself may be a turning point for Egypt ’ s Islamist leaders , in both their relations with the West and their role in the region . Since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak — a reliable ally of Washington and Israel — many in the West have been worried about how Egypt ’ s leaders might respond to the next confrontation that pits their allies in Hamas against Israel . As a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s parliamentary bloc , Mr. Morsi often railed against Israel ’ s occupation of the Palestinian territories and praised Hamas for rejecting the Western-backed peace process in favor of armed resistance .
Advisers to Mr. Morsi acknowledged that the latest Gaza battle had put them in a bind , caught between the electorate ’ s anger at Israel and Mr. Morsi ’ s own vows — to Egyptians and the West — to encourage peace in the region . “ If he responds fully to public opinion , he risks what we have been trying to do for peace and stability in the region , ” said a senior official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks .
When the test came , several American diplomats said , Mr. Morsi chose pragmatism over ideology , working closely with Washington to bring the antagonists to the table .
American officials and Mr. Morsi ’ s advisers , speaking on condition of anonymity , said both the Egyptian president and Mr. Obama had given the other room to manage the demands of their domestic constituencies . They spoke by telephone at least six times during the week of fighting , officials said . Mr. Morsi had looked past Mr. Obama ’ s repeated statements of support for Israel ’ s right to self-defense , while Mr. Obama did not object as Mr. Morsi publicly blamed the Israelis for both instigating the conflict and then using excessive force .
But behind the scenes , the Americans pushed the Israelis toward a truce and Mr. Morsi pressured Hamas , as the parties all acknowledged on Wednesday .
Essam el-Haddad , Mr. Morsi ’ s top foreign policy adviser , said , “ I think that the United States from the first moments was trying to find an end to the bloodshed . ”
“ Yes , they were carrying the point of view of the Israeli side , but they were understanding also the other side , the Palestinian side , ” he said of President Obama ’ s role . “ The sincerity and understanding was really very helpful . ”
Nabil Shaath , the Palestinian Authority ’ s commissioner for international relations , who was in Cairo during the early stages of the talks and met with key players , said the published agreement was intentionally kept “ as vague and as general and as concise as possible to avoid problems and misunderstandings . ”
Egypt ’ s role in the cease-fire remains unclear , Mr. Shaath said .
“ How much Egypt can really take the responsibility of a total sealing of the borders not to allow a bullet to come through , above or below ? ” he said .
