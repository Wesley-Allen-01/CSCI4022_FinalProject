After the producer was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women , Schneiderman sued him and his company to get restitution for survivors . And last week , he announced an investigation of the Manhattan district attorney ’ s handling of allegations against Weinstein .
Now Schneiderman has resigned , after four women reported that he abused them . One told Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker that Schneiderman choked her and slapped her so hard in the ear that she could feel the effects months later . Another said the abuse got to the point that “ we could rarely have sex without him beating me . ”
Schneiderman told the New Yorker that he had never assaulted anyone or “ engaged in nonconsensual sex. ” “ While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office , ” he said in a statement announcing his resignation , “ they will effectively prevent me from leading the office ’ s work at this critical time . ”
Schneiderman , a Democrat , is not the first champion of women ’ s rights and progressive causes to be accused of sexual misconduct — that list includes former Sen. Al Franken , author Junot Díaz , and , of course , Bill Clinton . But the revelations about Schneiderman are especially painful because when they came to light , he was engaged in a very public fight to get justice for harassment and assault survivors .
Schneiderman was supposed to be one of the heroes of # MeToo — now his story has turned into the movement ’ s biggest betrayal .
In the past few months , many men who publicly espouse feminist ideals have been accused of violating those ideals in private by harassing , assaulting , or abusing women . While in office , Franken wrote provisions of the Violence Against Women Act designed to ensure that survivors don ’ t have to pay for rape kits and to prevent housing discrimination against domestic violence survivors , according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press . A group of his former staffers called him “ a champion for women both in the legislation he supported and in promoting women to leadership roles in our offices . ”
But eight women say they saw a different side of Franken , alleging that he groped , forcibly kissed , or tried to kiss them . He resigned from the Senate in January . “ Some of the allegations against me are simply not true . Others , I remember very differently , ” he said in his resignation speech in December .
Díaz , meanwhile , had established a “ public persona as a writer who ‘ gets ’ women , sexism , and toxic masculinity , ” as ███ ’ s Constance Grady noted . He had also been praised for an April essay in the New Yorker about the devastating impact of the rape he endured as a child . But in May , writer Zinzi Clemmons reported that he had forcibly kissed her , and two other writers said he had berated them in ways they found misogynist or assaultive .
“ I take responsibility for my past , ” Díaz said in a statement in response to the allegations . “ I am listening to and learning from women ’ s stories in this essential and overdue cultural movement . ”
It ’ s not just men who have been accused of this kind of hypocrisy . California state Assembly member Cristina Garcia was one of the people honored as “ silence breakers ” by Time magazine in December for speaking out against sexual misconduct . Since then , she ’ s been accused of groping a male staffer and firing another who refused to play “ Spin the Bottle ” with her , the Washington Post reported . She has taken a leave of absence from the state legislature but has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct against her , calling them “ part of a concerted effort to discredit my person and record as a legislator . ”
President Clinton ’ s career was , in some ways , an early precursor to such stories — a supporter of abortion rights who signed the Family and Medical Leave Act and appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court , he also had a sexual relationship with an intern and was accused of rape and other sexual misconduct by other women . He has denied those accusations .
In some ways , though , the gap between public persona and private allegations feels largest for Eric Schneiderman . He didn ’ t just set himself up as a supporter of women ’ s rights in general — he went after Harvey Weinstein , the man who is an avatar for the current reckoning around sexual harassment and assault .
Schneiderman ’ s suit against the Weinstein Company and Weinstein himself , filed in February , painted a detailed and disturbing picture not just of the allegations against the producer himself but of the ways other Weinstein Company employees allegedly covered for him and failed to act on reports of his behavior , allowing the abuse of women to continue unabated for years .
Along with pathbreaking coverage by the New York Times and the New Yorker , it stood as crucial documentation of the reports of women about their treatment at the hands of a powerful man , and the ways that treatment was enabled by those who helped him maintain his power .
The suit called for restitution to the survivors of Weinstein ’ s alleged misconduct ; it was also designed to block any sale of the Weinstein Company that risked perpetuating past abuses .
“ Any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated , employees will be protected going forward , and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched , ” Schneiderman said in a February statement . “ Every New Yorker has a right to a workplace free of sexual harassment , intimidation , and fear . ”
In the months that followed , Schneiderman ’ s office helped broker a deal between the Weinstein Company and an investors ’ group for a sale that would include a victims ’ compensation fund and oust an executive who allegedly failed to take appropriate action on complaints against Weinstein . That deal subsequently fell through , apparently because the Weinstein Company had failed to disclose outstanding debts . Still , Schneiderman emerged as a key advocate for survivors and for the reform of a workplace reportedly tainted by systemic flaws .
And his work appeared to continue . Last week , on the direction of New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , Schneiderman ’ s office announced the appointment of a special deputy to investigate the Manhattan district attorney ’ s handling of 2015 sexual assault allegations against Weinstein .
Then on Monday , Mayer and Farrow reported that four women had accused Schneiderman of slapping , choking , or otherwise abusing them . One of them , Michelle Manning Barish , said she suffered problems with her ear for months after Schneiderman slapped her there ; at one point , blood trickled down to her collarbone . She also said he threatened her , telling her after she made a reference to him on social media , “ Don ’ t ever write about me . You don ’ t want to do that . ”
“ I am the law , ” she said he once told her . “ If there is a sentence that sums him up , it ’ s that . ”
Schneiderman understood abuse of power . His suit against Weinstein is a clear and stinging indictment of it . He tweeted about it in April , writing that “ without the reporting of the @ nytimes and the @ newyorker — and the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they endured at the hands of powerful men — there would not be the critical national reckoning underway . ”
At least according to Barish and the other women who have spoken out against him , Schneiderman used his understanding of the way power works not just to go after those who misused it but to abuse , intimidate , and threaten women in his own life . This makes the reports against him especially disturbing , even in a time when we ’ re becoming used to learning that people who seem like champions of women can also be abusers .
In public , Schneiderman seemed to strike at the very heart of the problems of sexual misconduct and violence against women . In private , according to women ’ s accounts , he was doing exactly what he fought against , hurting women and abusing his authority to keep them quiet about it .
A spokesperson for the attorney general ’ s office told ███ its work on the Weinstein lawsuit will continue . “ Our office has never been stronger , and this extraordinarily talented , dedicated , and tireless team of public servants will ensure that our work continues without interruption , ” said acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood in a statement on Tuesday .
As for Schneiderman himself , his legacy now seems not just tainted but reversed — once someone who fought against powerful men who think their position gives them the freedom to harm women , he ’ s now poised to go down in history as a chilling example of that phenomenon in action .","Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was one of Harvey Weinstein’s fiercest adversaries.

While there , she says , Biden forced her against the wall and penetrated her with his fingers . She first made the allegation during a podcast with political reporter Katie Halper last month and has since described the alleged ordeal in interviews with the New York Times , the Washington Post , and Business Insider .
Reade told ███ in a Tuesday phone interview that , since coming forward , she ’ s been subjected to “ shocking ” treatment from those she had expected to come to her aid : the very people who championed a woman ’ s “ right ” to be believed during the Kavanaugh confirmation episode two years prior , which Reade confirmed she followed at the time .

Two women , one a former neighbor and the other a former coworker , recently told Business Insider that Reade described the incident in separate conversations two years after it allegedly occurred . Reade ’ s brother and one friend have also said she told them about the assault soon after it happened .

Reade initially claimed in 2019 that Biden had touched her back and neck in a way that made her feel uncomfortable , but she didn ’ t say anything about sexual assault . She now attributes that apparent inconsistency to fear about the repercussions of making such an extreme claim about a presidential nominee .
“ I was too frightened to come forward at first , ” Reade said , adding that she nearly overcame her initial trepidation in the fall , but stopped short of publicizing the allegation after receiving a death threat .

Warren , who argued on the floor of the Senate that Blasey Ford ’ s allegation was sufficient to disqualify Brett Kavanaugh , responded with a form letter informing Reade that she couldn ’ t help because Reade was not a constituent of hers and suggesting that she reach out to her own representatives . Harris , who similarly insisted on the veracity of Blasey Ford ’ s claim despite the lack of evidence , didn ’ t respond to Reade ’ s letter at all .

Opinion contributor

One intriguing aspect of a new criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein is that the matter is assigned to the Public Corruption Unit of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office. As its name implies, that unit typically handles cases involving public officials. Epstein is instead the billionaire money manager who socializes with powerful people such as Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.

On Monday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) announced criminal charges against Epstein, alleging that he “sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls” between 2002 and 2005.

Epstein, 66, pleaded not guilty.

Significantly, the indictment covers conduct occurring not only at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion but also at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. The indictment alleges that Epstein worked with several employees and associates to entice girls as young as 14 to come to his homes to perform sex acts in exchange for money. He used some of the girls to recruit other minor victims by paying them, building a “vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit.” The indictment alleges that he targeted girls who were, “for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation.”

Long prison sentence facing Epstein

The trafficking count carries a sentence of up to 40 years in federal prison, where parole has been abolished.

In addition, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman stated that during the execution of a search warrant at Epstein’s home, agents found nude photographs of what appeared to be underage girls. That evidence could result in charges of possessing or even manufacturing child pornography, which carries an additional mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years per count. The math could add up quickly. Such a potentially lengthy sentence gives a defendant a powerful incentive to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others.

Abuse in the Boy Scouts:I was thrilled to be a Boy Scout, then for months I was sexually abused by my scoutmaster

This isn't Epstein's first scandal

Adding to the intrigue is Epstein’s history. He was the subject of a controversial nonprosecution agreement that was negotiated in 2007 with former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who now serves as the U.S. secretary of Labor. The agreement stated that Epstein was under investigation for violating sex trafficking laws for conduct occurring between 2001 and 2007. The agreement provided that no federal charges would be filed, and permitted Epstein to plead guilty to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution.

The agreement also provided that Epstein would serve 18 months in custody, but, in fact, he served only 13 months, mostly on work release at his own office. Epstein also acknowledged that he would be required to register as a sex offender and agreed to pay restitution to the victims.

In February, a judge found that prosecutors violated federal law by failing to notify the victims of the agreement before it was entered in court. The Department of Justice is now investigating allegations of professional misconduct by DOJ attorneys in handling the case.

In a particularly unusual provision of that agreement, Acosta agreed that prosecutors would “not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” and would “suspend” the grand jury investigation. That provision suggests Epstein was seeking to protect others beyond himself.

Epstein could have co-conspirators

It is unclear what has prompted the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York to file charges after the passage of so much time, but it is not bound by any promises made by another U.S. Attorney’s Office. Epstein was never charged under federal law in Florida, and so no jeopardy has attached for double jeopardy purposes. SDNY prosecutors were able to capture the conduct that occurred in Florida by using a conspiracy charge alleging that this part of the conspiracy occurred in New York. So long as any part of a conspiracy occurs in a particular district, the crime of conspiracy may be charged in that district, even if other parts of the conspiracy occurred elsewhere. Perhaps prosecutors simply want to vindicate the rights of victims who were mistreated in Florida. Or perhaps prosecutors have bigger targets than Epstein in mind.

Assault still a problem for military:Military sexual assaults spiked in 2018, and that means leaders are still failing to lead

If Epstein were protecting any potential co-conspirators during his negotiations with Acosta, the public corruption prosecutors in SDNY now have the leverage to find out.

sexual_misconduct,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42313637,Trump sex harassment accusers demand congressional inquiry,,,"Three women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct have demanded a congressional inquiry .
At a New York City news conference , the trio accused Mr Trump of groping , fondling , forcibly kissing , humiliating or harassing them .
Three of them - Jessica Leeds , Samantha Holvey , and Rachel Crooks - detailed their allegations shortly beforehand live on television .
The White House said the women were making `` false claims '' .
Monday morning 's press conference was organised by Brave New Films , which last month released a documentary , 16 Women and Donald Trump , about the claims made by multiple women .
Ms Leeds , Ms Holvey and Ms Crooks originally went public separately with their allegations a month before last year 's US presidential election .
The claims have been given a new lease of life by the harassment scandals that have engulfed high-profile public figures since October 's fall of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein .
On NBC News on Monday , Ms Holvey said Mr Trump had ogled her and other competitors in 2006 at the Miss USA beauty pageant , which he owned .
The former Miss North Carolina , who was 20-years-old at the time , said `` he lined all of us up '' and was `` just looking me over like I was just a piece of meat '' .
`` It left me feeling very gross , '' Ms Holvey told NBC host Megyn Kelly .
She later told the reporters : `` They 've investigated other Congress members , so I think it only stands fair that he [ Mr Trump ] is investigated as well
`` This is n't a partisan issue , this is , how women are treated every day . ''
Ms Leeds , now in her 70s , says that when she was 38 she sat next to Mr Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York and he sexually assaulted her .

Three women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct have demanded a congressional inquiry.

At a New York City news conference, the trio accused Mr Trump of groping, fondling, forcibly kissing, humiliating or harassing them.

Three of them - Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey, and Rachel Crooks - detailed their allegations shortly beforehand live on television.

The White House said the women were making ""false claims"".

Trump obscene remarks were real - TV host

Monday morning's press conference was organised by Brave New Films, which last month released a documentary, 16 Women and Donald Trump, about the claims made by multiple women.

Ms Leeds, Ms Holvey and Ms Crooks originally went public separately with their allegations a month before last year's US presidential election.

The claims have been given a new lease of life by the harassment scandals that have engulfed high-profile public figures since October's fall of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

On NBC News on Monday, Ms Holvey said Mr Trump had ogled her and other competitors in 2006 at the Miss USA beauty pageant, which he owned.

The former Miss North Carolina, who was 20-years-old at the time, said ""he lined all of us up"" and was ""just looking me over like I was just a piece of meat"".

""It left me feeling very gross,"" Ms Holvey told NBC host Megyn Kelly.

She later told the reporters: ""They've investigated other Congress members, so I think it only stands fair that he [Mr Trump] is investigated as well

""This isn't a partisan issue, this is, how women are treated every day.""

Ms Leeds, now in her 70s, says that when she was 38 she sat next to Mr Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York and he sexually assaulted her.

Ms Leeds said: ""He jumped all over me.""

She said she came forward because: ""I wanted people to know what kind of person Trump really is, and what a pervert he is.""

Ms Crooks said she was kissed on the lips by Mr Trump outside a lift in Trump Tower when she was a 22-year-old receptionist at a real estate company there.

""I was shocked,"" she said. ""Devastated.""

Additionally , more than two dozen company employees , past and present , detailed incidents of harassment , gender discrimination or retaliation at CBS , the report said .
In response to the story , Moonves , 68 , provided a statement to The New Yorker saying , `` I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances . ''
He continued : `` Those were mistakes , and I regret them immensely . But I always understood and respected -- and abided by the principle -- that 'no ' means 'no , ' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone 's career . ''
Illeana Douglas , an actress who has had roles in `` Goodfellas , '' `` To Die For , '' and many other films , spoke to Farrow and recalled meeting Moonves in 1996 and was eventually given a role in a TV show , the report said . The following year , Moonves reportedly phoned Douglas ' manager requesting a meeting for the pair to talk regarding an earlier script reading .
At that point , Douglas described the executive as being `` more than just my boss , '' adding that `` he was very much like a father figure , '' the report said .
`` In a millisecond , he 's got one arm over me , pinning me . '' — Illeana Douglas
Once at the meeting , Douglas told Farrow that she began to talk about the script when Moonves abruptly allegedly asked her if she was single .
`` I did n't know what to say at that point , '' Douglas recalled . `` I was , like , ' I 'm single , yes , no , maybe . ' ''
Douglas claimed that the executive asked permission to kiss her and after she tried to talk about work again , he approached her and allegedly started `` violently kissing '' her , Farrow 's report said .
`` In a millisecond , he 's got one arm over me , pinning me , '' she said .
Douglas claimed in the report that she lay motionless underneath Moonves , saying `` you sort of black out . ''
`` You think , How long is this going to go on ? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids . I could n't get him off me , '' she told Farrow .
She reportedly claimed the executive then lifted her skirt before asking , `` So , what do you think ? ''
`` My decision was to get out of it by joking my way out , so he feels flattered , '' she told Farrow . She claimed she told him , `` Yes , for the head of the network , you 're some good kisser . ''
`` It has stayed with me the rest of my life , that terror . '' — Illeana Douglas
Moonves then allegedly got up off of her and she seized the moment to end the meeting . As she approached the door , she claimed he got in her way and closed in , in what she described as being a `` physically scary '' moment , according to the report .
`` He says , 'We 're going to keep this between you and me , right ? ' '' Douglas told Farrow .
`` No , sir , we wo n't tell anyone that you 're a good kisser , '' she recalled saying before she left .
`` It was so invasive , '' Douglas told Farrow . `` It has stayed with me the rest of my life , that terror . ''
Dinah Kirgo , an Emmy-award winning writer of “ The Tracy Ullman Show , ” told Farrow that she and her sister had meetings with Moonves in the 1980s about a potential television deal , but that it ultimately went nowhere after Kirgo allegedly turned down a one-on-one dinner with Moonves .
“ He said , ‘ That was a great meeting , now we have to go out to dinner , ’ ” she told the outlet . When she allegedly replied that she would be happy to schedule something alongside her sister , Moonves demurred .
“ He said , ‘ No , just you and me. ’ He said , ‘ You ’ re very expensive , and I need to know you ’ re worth it , ’ ” Kirgo told Farrow .
“ I was sort of in shock and I said , ‘ Well , Leslie , I don ’ t think your wife would appreciate us having that kind of dinner . ’ ”
CBS told Farrow that Moonves did not recall the conversation . Kirgo said she believed that rejecting Moonves ’ alleged overtures hurt her career .
A former child star , identified only as Kimberly in the report , recalled a 1992 dinner meeting with Moonves . When the friend who coordinated the dinner stepped away , the woman said , Moonves aggressively pursued her .
“ Let ’ s go . Let ’ s just get a hotel room . Let ’ s just do this , ” she claimed Moonves said . “ I said , ‘ What are you talking about ? ’ ” When she said she explained that she had a child and was married , the CBS president allegedly became angered and left the restaurant .
She told Farrow that the intention to turn the meeting from professional to sexual in nature appeared to be well rehearsed . “ It was set up to be that way , ” she said . “ I thought , Wow , is this the way the world works and I just don ’ t get it ? ”
The allegations of misconduct in the report were not just limited to Moonves . They also extended to multiple senior staffers and the overall network .
Jeff Fager , who served as the CBS News chairman from 2011 until 2015 -- and currently serves as the executive producer of `` 60 Minutes '' -- also had multiple alleged encounters detailed .
Half a dozen employees said Fager would become intoxicated at company parties and subsequently start touching people .
`` It was always , 'Let 's go say hello to Jeff , 'cause you have to pay homage to him , but let 's do it early in the evening , before he starts getting really handsy , ' '' a former employee recounted to Farrow .
`` It is wrong that our culture can be falsely defined by a few people with an ax to grind who are using an important movement as a weapon to get even , and not by the hundreds of women and men that have thrived , both personally and professionally , at '60 Minutes , ' '' Fager said in a statement provided to The New Yorker .
But Fager , another source told Farrow , is `` an enabler of this 'Mad Men ' culture at '60 Minutes . ' ''
“ I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth . I had people touch my butt a couple times. ” — Former CBS employee
Multiple women described CBS as a `` frat house '' to Farrow . `` I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth , '' a former employee told him . `` I had people touch my butt a couple times . ''
A `` 60 Minutes '' producer , Ira Rosen , reportedly told a former journalist with the program to flirt with story sources . Rosen also made multiple sexual comments , she said . Two other women reiterated similar behavior to Farrow but Rosen dismissed the claims , stating that `` CBS extensively investigated these complaints and found them to be false , misleading and unsubstantiated . ''
Fox News ' request for comment from CBS was not immediately returned .
Farrow won a Pulitzer Prize and helped ignite the # MeToo movement when he exposed Hollywood heavy hitter Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator in The New Yorker . This , after NBC famously passed on the story .

Once at the meeting, Douglas told Farrow that she began to talk about the script when Moonves abruptly allegedly asked her if she was single.

""I didn't know what to say at that point,"" Douglas recalled. ""I was, like, 'I'm single, yes, no, maybe.'""

Douglas claimed that the executive asked permission to kiss her and after she tried to talk about work again, he approached her and allegedly started ""violently kissing"" her, Farrow's report said.

""In a millisecond, he's got one arm over me, pinning me,"" she said.

Douglas claimed in the report that she lay motionless underneath Moonves, saying ""you sort of black out.""

""You think, How long is this going to go on? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids. I couldn't get him off me,"" she told Farrow.

She reportedly claimed the executive then lifted her skirt before asking, ""So, what do you think?""

""My decision was to get out of it by joking my way out, so he feels flattered,"" she told Farrow. She claimed she told him, ""Yes, for the head of the network, you're some good kisser.""

""It has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror."" — Illeana Douglas

Moonves then allegedly got up off of her and she seized the moment to end the meeting. As she approached the door, she claimed he got in her way and closed in, in what she described as being a ""physically scary"" moment, according to the report.

""He says, 'We're going to keep this between you and me, right?'"" Douglas told Farrow.

""No, sir, we won't tell anyone that you're a good kisser,"" she recalled saying before she left.

""It was so invasive,"" Douglas told Farrow. ""It has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror.""

Dinah Kirgo, an Emmy-award winning writer of “The Tracy Ullman Show,” told Farrow that she and her sister had meetings with Moonves in the 1980s about a potential television deal, but that it ultimately went nowhere after Kirgo allegedly turned down a one-on-one dinner with Moonves.

“He said, ‘That was a great meeting, now we have to go out to dinner,’” she told the outlet. When she allegedly replied that she would be happy to schedule something alongside her sister, Moonves demurred.

“He said, ‘No, just you and me.’ He said, ‘You’re very expensive, and I need to know you’re worth it,’” Kirgo told Farrow.

“I was sort of in shock and I said, ‘Well, Leslie, I don’t think your wife would appreciate us having that kind of dinner.’”

CBS told Farrow that Moonves did not recall the conversation. Kirgo said she believed that rejecting Moonves’ alleged overtures hurt her career.

“It’s very insidious, what he did,” she said.

A former child star, identified only as Kimberly in the report, recalled a 1992 dinner meeting with Moonves. When the friend who coordinated the dinner stepped away, the woman said, Moonves aggressively pursued her.

“Let’s go. Let’s just get a hotel room. Let’s just do this,” she claimed Moonves said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about?’” When she said she explained that she had a child and was married, the CBS president allegedly became angered and left the restaurant.

She told Farrow that the intention to turn the meeting from professional to sexual in nature appeared to be well rehearsed. “It was set up to be that way,” she said. “I thought, Wow, is this the way the world works and I just don’t get it?”

The allegations of misconduct in the report were not just limited to Moonves. They also extended to multiple senior staffers and the overall network.

Jeff Fager, who served as the CBS News chairman from 2011 until 2015 -- and currently serves as the executive producer of ""60 Minutes"" -- also had multiple alleged encounters detailed.

Half a dozen employees said Fager would become intoxicated at company parties and subsequently start touching people.

""It was always, 'Let's go say hello to Jeff, 'cause you have to pay homage to him, but let's do it early in the evening, before he starts getting really handsy,'"" a former employee recounted to Farrow.

""It is wrong that our culture can be falsely defined by a few people with an ax to grind who are using an important movement as a weapon to get even, and not by the hundreds of women and men that have thrived, both personally and professionally, at '60 Minutes,'"" Fager said in a statement provided to The New Yorker.

But Fager, another source told Farrow, is ""an enabler of this 'Mad Men' culture at '60 Minutes.'""

“I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth. I had people touch my butt a couple times.” — Former CBS employee

Multiple women described CBS as a ""frat house"" to Farrow. ""I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth,"" a former employee told him. ""I had people touch my butt a couple times.""

A ""60 Minutes"" producer, Ira Rosen, reportedly told a former journalist with the program to flirt with story sources. Rosen also made multiple sexual comments, she said. Two other women reiterated similar behavior to Farrow but Rosen dismissed the claims, stating that ""CBS extensively investigated these complaints and found them to be false, misleading and unsubstantiated.""

Fox News' request for comment from CBS was not immediately returned.

Farrow won a Pulitzer Prize and helped ignite the #MeToo movement when he exposed Hollywood heavy hitter Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator in The New Yorker. This, after NBC famously passed on the story.

Farrow is set to explain his side of why NBC passed in an upcoming book.",www.foxnews.com,right,lgEU8ppA9wnKIMGu

WSCHMITT@NEWS-LEADER.COM

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The woman with whom Gov. Eric Greitens had an affair stood by her description of their encounters and apologized to the governor's wife in a new interview with a St. Louis television station.

The interview with KSDK-TV did not name the woman or show her face. During the airing on the 10 p.m. news, the woman expressed regret that she was part of a story that has exploded and dominated Missouri's political atmosphere since January.

""I didn't want this,"" the woman told KSDK. ""I wasn't out to get anyone. I really was just trying to live my life. ""

Greitens' relationship with his hairdresser in 2015 became common knowledge the evening of Jan. 10 when a different St. Louis broadcast outlet, KMOV-TV, reported Greitens admitted to cheating on his wife but denied blackmailing his hair stylist with a compromising photograph.

The woman's recollections about her initial encounter with Greitens were provided to the news media after her ex-husband secretly recorded her without permission and gave the tape to his attorney. The attorney has told the News-Leader that the man relied on recordings like this to revisit conversations with his ex-wife if he got too emotional.

Subsequent investigation led to a Feb. 22 indictment against Greitens by a St. Louis grand jury on a felony charge of invasion of privacy.

The woman never filed a police report and didn't want to talk about what happened to her, but she cooperated with prosecutors after charges were filed.

“In the event that we can come to a reasonable resolution as I’ve been seeking all week, then I will postpone the committee vote to accommodate her testimony. We cannot continue to delay,” Grassley said in a Friday statement before the extension.

One of the major sticking points was the committee’s proposed structure for the hearing.

“The Committee’s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,” Banks wrote in a statement earlier this week.

Ford and Kavanaugh are currently the only two witnesses expected to testify.

Judge and one other man also said to have been at the party also told the committee they don’t remember it, meaning Ford has no corroborating witnesses.

Whether the FBI would investigate was an earlier roadblock

Ford and her lawyers also threw up breaks over (the lack of) an FBI investigation: Ford had said she wouldn’t testify unless the FBI first conducted an investigation into the allegations, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen anytime soon.

Judiciary Republicans, the Department of Justice, and President Donald Trump have all thrown cold water on the idea of an FBI investigation. Grassley on Wednesday said it was not the job of the FBI to weigh the “credibility” of these allegations.

Ford’s call for an FBI probe echoes one that Democrats have been making ever since she came forward. The review they are pushing wouldn’t be a new criminal investigation but a reopening of Kavanaugh’s existing background check. The FBI may not be responsible for determining how seriously to consider allegations, but the agency plays a pivotal role in fact-finding and interviewing witnesses, they argue.

In the wake of Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas in 1991, President George H.W. Bush directed the FBI to open an investigation. The agency interviewed Hill, Thomas, and at least one other witness, after which the White House determined that Hill’s allegations were “unfounded.”

It’s well within Trump’s ability to do the same, but thus far, he’s shown little inclination that he’s interested in doing so. Ford’s decision to testify suggests she’s accepted the outcome and remains ready to speak out on her own rather than let the process continue without senators hearing what she has to say.",www.vox.com,left,fMQ5u36f5XTTzqBa

Al Franken ’ s latest excuse for the groping allegations against him is that he is a “ warm person ” who likes to “ hug people . ”
Four women have now come forward to accuse Franken of groping their butts or breasts . One of the women , Leeann Tweeden , also accused Franken of forcibly kissing her while rehearsing a skit on a USO trip in 2006 .
Franken released a Thanksgiving Day statement in which he attempted to downplay the allegations against him , while adding that he respects the “ feelings ” of his accusers . ( RELATED : Al Franken ’ s Evolving Responses To Sexual Harassment Allegations )
“ I ’ ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs , often in crowded and chaotic situations . I ’ m a warm person ; I hug people .

Four women have now come forward to accuse Franken of groping their butts or breasts. One of the women, Leeann Tweeden, also accused Franken of forcibly kissing her while rehearsing a skit on a USO trip in 2006.

Franken released a Thanksgiving Day statement in which he attempted to downplay the allegations against him, while adding that he respects the “feelings” of his accusers. (RELATED: Al Franken’s Evolving Responses To Sexual Harassment Allegations)

“I’ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations. I’m a warm person; I hug people.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – There’s a lot of talk about the parallels between Christine Blasey Ford’s expected testimony on Thursday against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Anita Hill’s testimony against now-Justice Clarence Thomas, 27 years ago.

That’s with good reason.

Both Ford and Hill are college professors whose reluctant disclosures sparked national conversations about sexual assault and harassment allegations, challenging nominees’ confirmation to the highest court. Kavanaugh and Thomas both vehemently denied the allegations as their supporters worked to undercut their accusers’ credibility. And the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold the hearing with Ford and Kavanaugh Thursday, includes some of the same members that weighed Hill’s allegations in 1991.

More: Brett Kavanaugh: Tensions rise as Senate hearing nears on sexual assault accusations

But there are also key differences between these episodes. Here are some:

Allegations

Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh included a physical assault whereas Hill’s did not. Ford alleges a drunken, 17-year-old Kavanaugh pinned her down at a party in 1982, groped her and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. She provided a therapist’s notes to The Washington Post and took a polygraph, but she has received criticism from Republicans for not being able to recall some details, including the exact location of the house.

Unlike Hill, she told no one of the allegations at the time, fearing her parents would be mad that she attended a party with underage drinking.

While Ford's allegations involve a high-school-age Kavanaugh, Hill’s allegations of sexual harassment were against Thomas as an adult, in his role as her supervisor at the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After Hill says she declined his multiple social requests, she said he began using work settings to describe sexual topics, including “his own sexual prowess.”

Investigation

Both women took their allegations to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but the response was different. In 1991, the committee referred Hill's allegations to the White House, which directed the FBI to interview Hill and Thomas. Senators agreed to a second hearing after reporter Nina Totenberg broke the story for National Public Radio, and they used the FBI’s background investigation while questioning Hill.

That’s not the case now. While Ford and Democrats have demanded the FBI reopen Kavanaugh’s background investigation, the FBI says it fulfilled its role by forwarding the allegations to the White House Counsel’s office. President Donald Trump told reporters on Sept. 18, ""I don’t think the FBI really should be involved because they don’t want to be involved.""

Culture shift

Sexual harassment in the workplace was an obscure topic before Hill elevated that discussion in 1991. Disclosures of such behavior were rare, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication.

“The Anita Hill hearing was happening in a different time and place,” she said. “The country is different. The #MeToo movement has changed the dialogue.”

Ford’s allegations follow myriad others of a similar nature over the past year. Women of the #MeToo movement have spoken out against sexual violence and harassment involving leaders in Hollywood, Congress and newsrooms.

Kavanaugh accusers Ford, Ramirez admit memory gaps: Here's what trauma experts say

Committee makeup

When Hill testified, she faced an all-male panel of senators.

Ford will testify before three of those same senators – Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., – along with an all-male roster of Republicans.

But the Democratic side now includes four women – Sens. Dianne Feinstein, the committee's ranking Democrat from California, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. Hirono has been an outspoken defender of Ford’s, while Harris and Klobuchar are former prosecutors who can be expected to grill Kavanaugh.

Polling

Americans in 1991 wanted Thomas to be confirmed, and polling in favor of his confirmation increased after Hill brought forward her allegations. A Gallup/CNN poll in July 1991 showed 52 percent of Americans supported his confirmation. A Gallup poll months after her allegations showed 58 percent in favor.

Disapproval for Kavanaugh, however, is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll. Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.

In the Before Times , Jody Kanikula and a half dozen fellow Democratic women activists would gather for drinks each Thursday after the weekly Kane County Democrats meeting in Geneva , Illinois . These days , they settle for Saturday morning Zoom calls to reimagine what their political organizing looks like now that their preferred tools of the trade—door knocking and mail drops—are off the table .
I met Kanikula and her friends in October 2018 , a high season of political activity . The group was trying to elect Democrat Lauren Underwood , then a 32-year-old nurse who ’ d guided the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , to Congress . The women were mostly new to politics , having dipped their toes into activism in the wake of Donald Trump ’ s election . They spent the 2018 cycle rebuilding Democratic infrastructure in their cluster of exurbs 50 miles west of Chicago , an area where Republicans had long ruled by default . That year , they focused their energies on ginning up excitement for a small slate of Democratic candidates . This time around , a Democrat is challenging a GOP officeholder in the county for every elected position but coroner .
In recent weeks , Tara Reade ’ s sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden have rippled through the group , setting off a flurry of notifications in their text chain with each new development . Reade ’ s claims are “ disheartening , ” Kanikula tells me . But like the 10 other “ resistance women ” I spoke with , she ’ s sticking with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee regardless . “ If it was a different kind of election , I ’ d give it more weight , ” she says . “ But the No . 1 goal is to get Trump out of there . ”
“ They have put a lot of energy into making politics be about more than just a single savior candidate . ”
Kanikula and her friends seem yanked from research conducted by Harvard sociologist Theda Skopcol and University of Pittsburgh historian Lara Putnam in the wake of the 2016 election . The scholars had identified a new brand of Democratic activist : white , college-educated women who live in suburban and exurban communities where “ country club Republicans ” had long reigned . In the wake of Trump ’ s victory , these women flocked to their nearest city for the Women ’ s March , formed Indivisible groups , and , eventually , worked with their local Democratic parties to unseat Republicans at every level of government .
This is not the usual picture of the resurgent activist left . Many accounts of the suburban woman ’ s political awakening are fond of anathematizing these activists as “ wine moms ” or “ MSNBC moms ” or the “ yoga vote. ” The Resistance was the new brunch , the new book club . For proof this was wrong one need only look at the 2018 midterms , when suburban women around the country— “ retired teachers , librarians , health care people , some businesswomen , ” as Skocpol put it—helped power the Blue Wave that swept Democrats into control of the House . Health care was at the heart of their organizing efforts , a big reason it ’ s at the heart of the Democratic agenda today . This cycle , Biden not only needs these women to vote—he ’ s relying on them to keep Democratic enthusiasm alive in their communities through November . The campaign ’ s online strategy is shaped around appealing to what its digital director recently called , not a little cringingly , the “ suburban Facebook empathy moms . ”
These activists had been forged in no small part by Trump ’ s chronic degradation of women ; as it stands , roughly two dozen have accused him of sexual assault . But as an allegation concerning their party ’ s presidential candidate captures national headlines , the women I spoke with remain committed to their political activism . That ’ s not because they believe Biden—though many do . It ’ s because their ultimate goal is limiting Trump to one term . If that requires some compromises along the way , so be it .
“ Do they think that sexual assault is okay ? No , ” Putnam says . “ Do they think that being a woman involved in politics , where there are still lots of male politicians , means a lot of compromises all the time in order to get things done ? Yes . ”
Reade ’ s claims against Biden have taken a muddled route to the national spotlight . In April 2019 , Reade came forward to claim the former vice president had touched her neck and shoulders inappropriately when she had been an aide in his Senate office in the early 1990s ; that claim had been corroborated by several of her contemporaries and more than half a dozen women who ’ d made similar allegations .
But this spring , Reade leveled a more serious accusation at the former vice president : that he had shoved her against the wall of a Senate office building , reached under her skirt , and digitally penetrated her.Biden outright denies these claims . Reporters , lacking the copious documentation or clear pattern of predation on which much of # MeToo reporting is built , have thus far been unable to move the story onto the sturdier footing . The circumstances are best summarized by Vox ’ s Laura McGann , who spent more than a year investigating Reade ’ s allegations : “ None of this means Reade is lying , but it leaves us in a limbo of Me Too : a story that may be true but that we can ’ t prove . ”
A new Monmouth poll found that only 20 percent of Democrats think Reade is telling the truth , a sentiment mirrored by the activists I spoke with who say many are still processing the allegations . “ I don ’ t think anyone ’ s rushing to judgment now , ” Kierstyn Zolfo , the Pennsylvania statewide legislative chair for Indivisible , tells me . Barb Kaplan , who leads an Indivisible group in the Cleveland suburbs , says fellow activists she ’ s spoken with “ want to see some hard evidence , ” adding that “ most see it as a distraction . ”
But Putnam suggests another force is at work , and she points to the presidential primary as evidence . Biden had never been these activists ’ favorite candidate—most of them preferred Elizabeth Warren or one of the other two dozen Democrats who sought the presidency this cycle . But these women got into politics , Putnam explains , with a vision of building Democratic political power above all else . Just as choosing one candidate over another is antithetical to their mission , so too would be calling for the removal of a candidate who most Democrats think did nothing wrong .
“ They have put a lot of energy into making politics be about more than just a single savior candidate—whether that ’ s a candidate who they really loved or really disliked , ” Putnam says . “ They have been girding themselves for living with an outcome they knew they were not going to be personally excited about at the top of the ticket . ”
“ Coming out of 2016 , most people have been unified in driving Trump out of the White House , ” Kaplan says . “ It ’ s going to be really hard to dissuade them from that position . ”
This shouldn ’ t be mistaken for blind party loyalty—indeed , a number of these activists , some of them former Republicans , identify as independents . Nor are these women turning a blind eye to the claims . In fact , quite the opposite : For many , Biden ’ s history of behavior toward women has already been factored into their dim view of the candidate . Besides the allegations raised last spring , many activists—in particular , the older , professional women who make of up the bulk of the cohort—haven ’ t forgiven Biden for the way he treated Anita Hill , the law professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment . As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Biden presided over Thomas ’ confirmation hearing and failed to seriously investigate Hill ’ s accusations or call corroborating witnesses to testify against Thomas . Last year , Hill accused Biden of having “ set the stage ” for Brett Kavanaugh ’ s Supreme Court confirmation in 2018 , when claims of sexual misconduct made against the judge were also poorly handled .
Such realpolitik can seem at odds with the revulsion that pushed many of the activists into politics in the first place . But to hear Lark Cowart tell it , that moral energy hasn ’ t dissipated ; it was merely channeled elsewhere once the women ’ s preferred candidates began to exit the presidential race . “ When you lose your grand motivation , you ’ re finding other races and things to focus on , ” says Cowart , a member of the Kane County group . “ I ’ ll pour my energies behind the women who are running . ”
Melissa Rodriguez , who runs an Indivisible group near Dayton , Ohio , said her members had come to a similar agreement when Biden became the nominee . “ If you want to spend your energy on a local race or voter registration , go for it , ” she recalls saying . “ We ’ re just pushing toward a great Democratic turnout . ”
The suburbs helped deliver the Democratic nomination to Biden , and he ’ ll rely on them to unseat Trump come November . His nascent digital operation has set its sights on those “ empathy moms ” whom the campaign believes can be won over with appeals to human decency—the premise of much of Biden ’ s relatively non-ideological campaign . In the midst of the pandemic , paid family leave , health care , and related domestic issues are top of mind for swing voters . As for sexual assault , “ it ’ s way down the list , ” says Tresa Undem , a pollster who specializes in surveys on gender issues .
Undem is keeping a close eye on independent women voters . They ’ re less likely to view the allegations through a politicized lens—and in general they tend toward nihilistic doubts about their ability to change anything . Whether these voters see a difference between the parties on issues related to women could be an indicator of their apathy , Undem says . “ Could this dampen their vote ? Yes . ”
And a lot of voter opinion , she says , will hinge on how much airtime the allegations receive in the coming weeks and months . That doesn ’ t just mean news stories with new information—attack ads , Undem says , could play that role , something the Trump campaign already seems to have realized . “ Ultimately , ” she says , “ it could create the impression that neither candidate , and neither party , is good . ”","For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more, subscribe to Mother Jones' newsletters

The circumstances are best summarized by Vox’s Laura McGann, who spent more than a year investigating Reade’s allegations: “None of this means Reade is lying, but it leaves us in a limbo of Me Too: a story that may be true but that we can’t prove.”

A new Monmouth poll found that only 20 percent of Democrats think Reade is telling the truth, a sentiment mirrored by the activists I spoke with who say many are still processing the allegations. “I don’t think anyone’s rushing to judgment now,” Kierstyn Zolfo, the Pennsylvania statewide legislative chair for Indivisible, tells me. Barb Kaplan, who leads an Indivisible group in the Cleveland suburbs, says fellow activists she’s spoken with “want to see some hard evidence,” adding that “most see it as a distraction.”

But Putnam suggests another force is at work, and she points to the presidential primary as evidence. Biden had never been these activists’ favorite candidate—most of them preferred Elizabeth Warren or one of the other two dozen Democrats who sought the presidency this cycle. But these women got into politics, Putnam explains, with a vision of building Democratic political power above all else. Just as choosing one candidate over another is antithetical to their mission, so too would be calling for the removal of a candidate who most Democrats think did nothing wrong.

“They have put a lot of energy into making politics be about more than just a single savior candidate—whether that’s a candidate who they really loved or really disliked,” Putnam says. “They have been girding themselves for living with an outcome they knew they were not going to be personally excited about at the top of the ticket.”

“Coming out of 2016, most people have been unified in driving Trump out of the White House,” Kaplan says. “It’s going to be really hard to dissuade them from that position.”

This shouldn’t be mistaken for blind party loyalty—indeed, a number of these activists, some of them former Republicans, identify as independents. Nor are these women turning a blind eye to the claims. In fact, quite the opposite: For many, Biden’s history of behavior toward women has already been factored into their dim view of the candidate. Besides the allegations raised last spring, many activists—in particular, the older, professional women who make of up the bulk of the cohort—haven’t forgiven Biden for the way he treated Anita Hill, the law professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden presided over Thomas’ confirmation hearing and failed to seriously investigate Hill’s accusations or call corroborating witnesses to testify against Thomas. Last year, Hill accused Biden of having “set the stage” for Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in 2018, when claims of sexual misconduct made against the judge were also poorly handled.

Such realpolitik can seem at odds with the revulsion that pushed many of the activists into politics in the first place. But to hear Lark Cowart tell it, that moral energy hasn’t dissipated; it was merely channeled elsewhere once the women’s preferred candidates began to exit the presidential race. “When you lose your grand motivation, you’re finding other races and things to focus on,” says Cowart, a member of the Kane County group. “I’ll pour my energies behind the women who are running.”

Melissa Rodriguez, who runs an Indivisible group near Dayton, Ohio, said her members had come to a similar agreement when Biden became the nominee. “If you want to spend your energy on a local race or voter registration, go for it,” she recalls saying. “We’re just pushing toward a great Democratic turnout.”

The suburbs helped deliver the Democratic nomination to Biden, and he’ll rely on them to unseat Trump come November. His nascent digital operation has set its sights on those “empathy moms” whom the campaign believes can be won over with appeals to human decency—the premise of much of Biden’s relatively non-ideological campaign. In the midst of the pandemic, paid family leave, health care, and related domestic issues are top of mind for swing voters. As for sexual assault, “it’s way down the list,” says Tresa Undem, a pollster who specializes in surveys on gender issues.

Undem is keeping a close eye on independent women voters. They’re less likely to view the allegations through a politicized lens—and in general they tend toward nihilistic doubts about their ability to change anything. Whether these voters see a difference between the parties on issues related to women could be an indicator of their apathy, Undem says. “Could this dampen their vote? Yes.”

And a lot of voter opinion, she says, will hinge on how much airtime the allegations receive in the coming weeks and months. That doesn’t just mean news stories with new information—attack ads, Undem says, could play that role, something the Trump campaign already seems to have realized. “Ultimately,” she says, “it could create the impression that neither candidate, and neither party, is good.”",www.motherjones.com,left,UaNdxlcEiKmx5FH9
sexual_misconduct,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-shakedown-schneiderman/,The Rise and Fall of Shakedown Schneiderman,,"Jeffrey Lord, Dov Fischer, R. Emmett Tyrrell, William Murchison","The other day , someone who was discussed in this space a couple times way back there in the primordial mists of 2013 suddenly resigned his job as Attorney General of New York . That would be one Eric Schneiderman , who was discussed here in a blog post from August , 2013 titled : “ New Obama Scandal Erupts : Trump Targeted. ” ( In which a meeting between then-President Obama and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman — Trump haters both — was discussed . ) Then there was this one , a column titled “ Shakedown Schneiderman , ” and also another , “ The Malversation of Eric Schneiderman . ”
In all of which I had come to the thoroughgoing conclusion that Mr. Schneiderman ’ s conduct as Attorney General indicated he was , simply put , a fraud — and a dangerous fraud at that . This was no dedicated public servant of the liberal variety . This was someone who , as the words of a leftist columnist for the Village Voice described it , saw his job as being “ transactional. ” Which is to say — “ You do something for me , and I will use the powers of my job as Attorney General to do something for you . ”
Mr. Schneiderman had come to my attention as I was reading the public prints and learning that Schneiderman was suing a private citizen in New York named… Donald Trump . The lawsuit was over what was called in the day “ Trump University , ” a typical organization of motivational-style instructors who were experts in the real estate business . One paid to hear from the speakers and learn the how-to of real estate but then… horrors ! — one had actually to go out and do the work . As is to be expected with such a venture , some people succeeded , others failed . So the grousings from the latter group , which was small , were quickly focused on by Schneiderman and suddenly Donald Trump ’ s name was giving Schneiderman lots of PR as the figurative defender of the little guy .
Having been around the political block , to me , something was , as they say , “ rotten in Denmark. ” Or Albany as the ( frequent ) case seems to be . Of all the things going on in New York State — why zero in on someone as hugely successful as Donald Trump ? The idea that a billionaire ten times over was trying to defraud a handful of people out of a few thousand dollars made no sense . So , I began to look . In fact , Donald Trump took the time to speak with me directly on the issue . He was indignant . And what did I learn ?
I learned that — yes , indeed — Schneiderman had been after Donald Trump for a campaign contribution . Receiving it , Schneiderman was not satisfied . Now the arm was being put on Trump family members — daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared specifically . Not satisfied there , Schneiderman was going to Trump Organization staff . And then… the hook .
Still not satisfied with what he was getting from the family Trump , he began to take another approach once elected and actually becoming the sitting attorney general . I wrote this :
Let ’ s begin specifically by thinking of Donald Trump ’ s multi-billion-dollar , resoundingly successful company — The Trump Organization — as Khartoum the race horse . Khartoum the race horse ? You remember Khartoum the race horse . The scene is immortalized in the Oscar-winning film The Godfather . The rich and famous Hollywood producer Jack Woltz , owner of the $ 600,000 Secretariat-like race horse Khartoum , refuses to put Mafia Don Vito Corleone ’ s favored godson Johnny Fontane in a movie . One fine morning , Woltz awakens , horrified , to find the severed head of his beloved race horse — whom he has lovingly described beforehand as “ the greatest racehorse in the world ” — in his blood-soaked bed . As seen here in the legendary scene from the film version of Mario Puzo ’ s bestselling novel . Message delivered , Don Corleone ’ s god son Johnny Fontane gets his movie part from the thoroughly terrified movie producer . Now . Think of Eric Schneiderman , the Attorney General of New York , supposed progressive “ icon of the left ” and a wannabe governor — as a dime store Godfather . Vicious , but Vito Corleone without the gravitas .
The core of Shakedown Schneiderman ’ s Don Corleone-style method of operation is captured by the famous line from the Don himself . As Puzo immortalized the line in The Godfather , the Don would get Johnny Fontane the desired movie part in unique fashion , saying of producer Woltz : “ He ’ s a businessman . I ’ ll make him an offer he can ’ t refuse. ” The offer , of course , was Khartoum ’ s severed head . The blunt message ? Next time it would be Woltz ’ s head . What was Schneiderman ’ s “ offer he can ’ t refuse ” to businessman Donald Trump ? In Schneiderman ’ s own words to Trump ’ s counsel , as documented in the Trump filing , Donald Trump would be forced to settle the lawsuit Schneiderman was threatening because Trump would not “ want all of the bad press. ” As in : Nice business ya got there Mr. Trump . Be a shame if anything happened to it .
To say the least , this kind of thing does not speak well of an Attorney General . I looked further into Schneiderman ’ s past to discover this :
The AG ’ s career also depends on Schneiderman keeping his coattails free of corruption charges , which thus far has been dicey . A federal sentencing memorandum on Schneiderman ’ s ex-State Senate colleague Shirley Huntley prompted Huntley ’ s attorney , according to the New York Daily News , to allege her client had information “ about corruption involving Eric Schneiderman. ” This doesn ’ t even count the murmurs from Schneiderman ’ s political base of New York ’ s hard left that he is , among other things , a “ water boy ” and “ transactional . ”
A few weeks later I followed up with another column , “ The Malversation of Eric Schneiderman. ” In which I reported this :
Uh-oh . New York Attorney General Eric “ Shakedown ” Schneiderman has just been walloped with an ethics complaint . A long and meticulously detailed 228-page ethics complaint . Filed by… Donald Trump .
Suffice to say , that ethics complaint was detailed to the max . It was chapter and verse what I suspected — that the transactional Mr. Schneiderman was unhappy he had not gotten the Trump campaign contributions he thought were his due . And so I ended the column this way :
The fix was in for Donald Trump . And according to the Constitution of New York State ? That is malversation — cause for removal from office . Your move , Governor Cuomo .
Well , finally , Governor Cuomo moved . Five years late , but he finally did something . Cuomo acted after a major assist from the New Yorker and reporters Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow , the latter the journalist who uncovered the massive Harvey Weinstein story . Their story is remarkable in the detailed portrait of an abuser of women who was frequently so drunk he couldn ’ t stand up . The ultimate of empty vessels . Amazing . Yet , it must be said , so terribly predictable to me and certainly to President Trump . In fact , the future president had tweeted this in 2013 : “ Weiner is gone , Spitzer is gone — next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman . Is he a crook ? Wait and see , worse than Spitzer or Weiner ”
As it happens , as I well recall , this tweet came a matter of days after I had spoken with Mr. Trump about this very subject . He was clearly of the view that Schneiderman was a crook and especially angry at the Attorney General for the slimy game being played with Ivanka , Jared , and his staff . And as is so often the case , Donald Trump was unerringly right .
Here we are five years later and there is this as written by Mayer and Farrow , writing about Michelle Manning Barish , one of the women who has come forward with her accusations . Bold print for emphasis is supplied :
Since the # MeToo movement began , Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms , cheering on women who have spoken out , including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken , a widely admired Democrat . Once , she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media , in connection with a political issue . He called her and , in a tone that she describes as “ nasty , ” said , “ Don ’ t ever write about me . You don ’ t want to do that. ” Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat , just as she took seriously a comment that he ’ d once made after she objected to him “ yanking ” her across a street . She recalls saying to him , “ Jaywalking is against the law , ” and him responding , “ I am the law. ” Manning Barish says , “ If there is a sentence that sums him up , it ’ s that . ”
In other words ? In other words this was the pattern of Schneiderman ’ s transactional approach to his job as Attorney General . He was the law , and he would use the law to get what he wanted . What did he want from Donald Trump ? Money — and if not enough money he would use Trump and the Trump family to get publicity by going after Trump with the powers of the New York Attorney General . What did he want with Ms. Manning Barish and the other women ? Sex . And if they stood up to him — as did Donald Trump — they would be reminded by Schneiderman : “ I am the law . ”
This was a person seriously unfit for public office of any kind . He abused his office and the public trust just as he abused women .
The real question here ? As with Harvey Weinstein , it simply isn ’ t possible that Schneiderman was conducting himself in this fashion and people did not know . In the Schneiderman case , Albany was Hollywood . The idea that Governor Cuomo , the leaders of the State Legislature , New York City Mayor de Blasio and others ( where was the New York media ? ? ? ) were clueless about Schneiderman ’ s problems doesn ’ t even come close to passing the smell test . Cuomo is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for president . If that comes to pass , the Schneiderman episode is surely going to cause him a problem of the “ what did you know and when did you know it ” variety .
Is this a tragedy for Eric Schneiderman the human being , and his family ? Of course . He will spend one very long time dealing with this — possibly the rest of his life — with no small irony being that he will find out that no , actually , he is not the law .
In the world of cosmic justice ? Eric Schneiderman may be going to jail .","Well.

So his antics finally caught up with him.

The other day, someone who was discussed in this space a couple times way back there in the primordial mists of 2013 suddenly resigned his job as Attorney General of New York.

Mccarthy, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Nro Contributor","Civilization does not cure men of malice , especially when there are no repercussions for bad behavior .
Observers look for some sort of common denominator that would make sense of the daily news blasts of nonconsensual sexual escapades of media , political , and Hollywood celebrities .
No sooner are these lists of the accused compiled than they have to be updated , hourly . Long hushed , covered-up , or even forgotten sexual IEDs suddenly go off without warning and blow up a career .
Weirder still , the now-outraged often overnight can become the outrageous .
One moment Richard Dreyfuss expressed furor when he learned that gay actor Kevin Spacey long ago had groped his own son under the table ( while the three were working on a script ) . The next minute , Dreyfuss himself was accused of an earlier repulsive unwanted sex act or advance toward a female subordinate .
New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush condemns the bad behavior of journalist Mark Halperin — and then finds himself accused of similar coerced sexual behavior . Senator Al Franken ’ s often sanctimonious outrages over the Fox News harassers would soon apply just as easily to his own behavior . We forget that the original context of Juvenal ’ s famous quip “ Who will police the police ? ” was the insidiousness of sex .
Note these latest scandals are different from the age-old stories of consensual adultery . They are mostly not consensual affairs in the workplace , supposedly initiated by grasping subordinates or by oppressive bosses in midlife crises . Nor are they the connivances in dating and courtship — all the sort of consenting unions gone awry that are the stuff of novels and films .
Instead , in nearly all these examples of sexual harassment , there is inherently a beauty-and-the-beast asymmetry , male arrogance — and spitefulness . What repels is not just unwanted or coerced sex acts — but the gratuitous cruelty that so often surrounds them .
So what are the common pathologies to all these male icons — who are falling as fast as Confederate statutes a few months ago , in our earlier manifestation of collective moral frenzy ?
Was it male-menopause desperation on the part of these middle-aged men ?
Did fear of aging or death drive them to use their assumed power to get sex ( of various sorts ) ?
Did the terror of fading away bring Charlie Rose ’ s proverbial “ crusty paw ” out of his sleeve ? His targets were almost always younger , less experienced , and attractive professional women .
Few such women would probably have willingly consorted with someone like the septuagenarian Rose or the off-putting Weinstein ( who had an uncanny resemblance to the late gruff American actor Kenneth McMillan , who played the creepy Baron Harkonnen in Dune ) ?
Men of the Left assumed that their loudly professed feminist credentials earned them indulgences and exemptions .
Or were the prominent culprits more often liberals and progressives ? Men of the Left assumed that their loudly professed feminist credentials earned them indulgences and exemptions to covet as they pleased .
Many progressive predators assumed that if they were caught , most of the victimized women would weigh the damage that might be done to the liberal cause if they took out one of the good guys on their side . ( Remember Bill Clinton ’ s progressive , “ feminist ” defenders of the 1990s . )
Is the fuel of these accusations , then , loss of deterrence : Once a man of influence and power believes that his abstract morality can cloak his private immorality , there are few restraints left in our postmodern secular age to restrain his setting libido ?
Or was the catalyst for harassment age-old ego and narcissism ?
Being before the cameras and in the spotlight befuddled these celebrities into the delusional thought that their name recognition and petit fame meant that women — all women of every age and station — secretly wished to be part of their inner circle . Did they assume , despite their targets ’ clearly expressed uninterest or outright resistance , that women “ really ” wished a Matt Lauer or Mark Halperin would flirt or make advances ?
Or was the problem occasionally rooted in the proverbial “ revenge of the nerds ” factor ?
The perpetrators were neither in their salad days nor athletes or physically robust . But mostly they were the former nerds of high school and college , who had been ignored by the dating crowd and who later excelled in writing , talking , making money , or administering .
Once they found that their intellectual , artistic , or political niches worked like a narcotic on the naïve , perhaps they sought to make up for lost time . In other words , they would somehow do in their fifties , sixties , and seventies what they had failed to do in their twenties and thirties — now coercing with the brain and tongue what they had once failed to win with their biceps .
Or were they just workaholic players who wished to engage in quickie impersonal sex ? Their modus operandi was to skip the preliminaries and just crudely get down to business . And their warped logic was that for every ten targets that were repulsed by phallic exhibition , groping , or potty talk , there might be one who was some kindred demented spirit .
All of the above may explain a similar pattern of behavior . But one ingredient seems missing in these analyses : gratuitous cruelty .
Think of the smirk on Al Franken ’ s face when he posed for the camera while fondling the breasts of a sleeping Leeann Tweeden . Why the need for a smile of triumph in humiliating an unaware target ?
Think of Matt Lauer ’ s purported sicko game of asking fellow grandees whether they would wish to marry , have sex with — or kill — his various female co-hosts ? In what category would Lauer himself have fit , had his female subordinates played the same game about their bosses ?
Think of Bill Clinton allegedly smirking as he stalked out of a hotel room , advising the bleeding Juanita Broaddrick to “ put some ice ” on her lip that Clinton had just reportedly chewed .
Think of Glenn Thrush fabricating stories of role reversal , to depict the victimized women as vixens for their supposed pursuit of him . Are we really to take seriously the claim of a dorky Garrison Keillor that he was groped dozens of times by nymphomaniac women , a victimhood apparently that offsets his victimizing ?
In the most macabre sense , think of the doomed Mary Jo Kopechne thrashing about in a sunken car , fighting for her young life , as the drunken driver and perpetrator — Ted Kennedy — sulked about on shore , worrying only about losing his Camelot career .
Think of Charlie Rose ’ s victims who described the “ fury ” of his advances and his “ animalistic ” tactics . One victim said that Rose grabbed her hair and twisted her neck ; another found herself trapped in his country house without transportation home , crying as Rose grew angry that she had not welcomed his sexual exhibitionism .
Think of the similar sick exhibitionism of a Conyers or Weinstein . Both deliberately walked about in their underwear or in open robes , glaring at their grossed-out targets as they reacted negatively to their phallic exposure . ( After how many terms in office , or after how many hit movies , did Conyers or Weinstein decide it was now an uplifting experience for a female subordinate to catch sight of his male organ ? )
Think of a Mark Halperin allegedly pressing a woman against a window , or masturbating behind a desk as he leered at her .
The streak of malice is so frequent in all these allegations that it becomes a theme .
Did the callousness result from the idea that such important men had a strict timetable , with not a second to be wasted by romance or even rudimentary expressions of professionalism and friendship ? But why did they not even feign liking the women they coerced ?
Are feminist theoreticians on to something when they say that in these cases of sexual assault , physical gratification is only part of the equation ( sometimes a small part ) — that the real impetus might be the sadism of nastily humiliating someone judged weaker ?
I grew up on a farm and live there now , and for over half a century , I ’ ve at various times been surrounded by dogs , donkeys , horses , cows , and wild animals ranging from hawks to coyotes . One notices over the decades how animals eat and couple .
They are utilitarian and in the human sense selfish to the core . The animal does not know where its next meal comes from , and so he bites , growls , and attacks any rival who gets too close as he almost instantaneously gulps down or swallows whole his meal .
In matters of sex , the male animal , after an occasional rudimentary display of intention , simply approaches his target and attempts to mount ; if he faces too much opposition , he tries again later or approaches another target . There is , of course , a Darwinian explanation for animal behavior . But humans are supposed to have developed over the centuries a civilized culture to repress our innate selfishness and cruelty in matters of food and sex .
These men seemed to have enjoyed reverting to their premodern reptilian selves . Do they revert all the more easily to their instincts also because there are few marshals to take them down ?

Civilization does not cure men of malice, especially when there are no repercussions for bad behavior.

Observers look for some sort of common denominator that would make sense of the daily news blasts of nonconsensual sexual escapades of media, political, and Hollywood celebrities.

No sooner are these lists of the accused compiled than they have to be updated, hourly. Long hushed, covered-up, or even forgotten sexual IEDs suddenly go off without warning and blow up a career.

Weirder still, the now-outraged often overnight can become the outrageous.

One moment Richard Dreyfuss expressed furor when he learned that gay actor Kevin Spacey long ago had groped his own son under the table (while the three were working on a script). The next minute, Dreyfuss himself was accused of an earlier repulsive unwanted sex act or advance toward a female subordinate.

New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush condemns the bad behavior of journalist Mark Halperin — and then finds himself accused of similar coerced sexual behavior. Senator Al Franken’s often sanctimonious outrages over the Fox News harassers would soon apply just as easily to his own behavior. We forget that the original context of Juvenal’s famous quip “Who will police the police?” was the insidiousness of sex.

Note these latest scandals are different from the age-old stories of consensual adultery. They are mostly not consensual affairs in the workplace, supposedly initiated by grasping subordinates or by oppressive bosses in midlife crises. Nor are they the connivances in dating and courtship — all the sort of consenting unions gone awry that are the stuff of novels and films.

Instead, in nearly all these examples of sexual harassment, there is inherently a beauty-and-the-beast asymmetry, male arrogance — and spitefulness. What repels is not just unwanted or coerced sex acts — but the gratuitous cruelty that so often surrounds them.

So what are the common pathologies to all these male icons — who are falling as fast as Confederate statutes a few months ago, in our earlier manifestation of collective moral frenzy?

Was it male-menopause desperation on the part of these middle-aged men?

Did fear of aging or death drive them to use their assumed power to get sex (of various sorts)?

Did the terror of fading away bring Charlie Rose’s proverbial “crusty paw” out of his sleeve? His targets were almost always younger, less experienced, and attractive professional women.

Few such women would probably have willingly consorted with someone like the septuagenarian Rose or the off-putting Weinstein (who had an uncanny resemblance to the late gruff American actor Kenneth McMillan, who played the creepy Baron Harkonnen in Dune)?

Men of the Left assumed that their loudly professed feminist credentials earned them indulgences and exemptions.

Or were the prominent culprits more often liberals and progressives? Men of the Left assumed that their loudly professed feminist credentials earned them indulgences and exemptions to covet as they pleased.

Many progressive predators assumed that if they were caught, most of the victimized women would weigh the damage that might be done to the liberal cause if they took out one of the good guys on their side. (Remember Bill Clinton’s progressive, “feminist” defenders of the 1990s.)

Is the fuel of these accusations, then, loss of deterrence: Once a man of influence and power believes that his abstract morality can cloak his private immorality, there are few restraints left in our postmodern secular age to restrain his setting libido?

Or was the catalyst for harassment age-old ego and narcissism?

Being before the cameras and in the spotlight befuddled these celebrities into the delusional thought that their name recognition and petit fame meant that women — all women of every age and station — secretly wished to be part of their inner circle. Did they assume, despite their targets’ clearly expressed uninterest or outright resistance, that women “really” wished a Matt Lauer or Mark Halperin would flirt or make advances?

Or was the problem occasionally rooted in the proverbial “revenge of the nerds” factor?

The perpetrators were neither in their salad days nor athletes or physically robust. But mostly they were the former nerds of high school and college, who had been ignored by the dating crowd and who later excelled in writing, talking, making money, or administering.

Once they found that their intellectual, artistic, or political niches worked like a narcotic on the naïve, perhaps they sought to make up for lost time. In other words, they would somehow do in their fifties, sixties, and seventies what they had failed to do in their twenties and thirties — now coercing with the brain and tongue what they had once failed to win with their biceps.

Or were they just workaholic players who wished to engage in quickie impersonal sex? Their modus operandi was to skip the preliminaries and just crudely get down to business. And their warped logic was that for every ten targets that were repulsed by phallic exhibition, groping, or potty talk, there might be one who was some kindred demented spirit.

All of the above may explain a similar pattern of behavior. But one ingredient seems missing in these analyses: gratuitous cruelty.

Advertisement

Almost every allegation contains some theme of male orneriness.

Think of the smirk on Al Franken’s face when he posed for the camera while fondling the breasts of a sleeping Leeann Tweeden. Why the need for a smile of triumph in humiliating an unaware target?

Think of Matt Lauer’s purported sicko game of asking fellow grandees whether they would wish to marry, have sex with — or kill — his various female co-hosts? In what category would Lauer himself have fit, had his female subordinates played the same game about their bosses?

Think of Bill Clinton allegedly smirking as he stalked out of a hotel room, advising the bleeding Juanita Broaddrick to “put some ice” on her lip that Clinton had just reportedly chewed.

Think of Glenn Thrush fabricating stories of role reversal, to depict the victimized women as vixens for their supposed pursuit of him. Are we really to take seriously the claim of a dorky Garrison Keillor that he was groped dozens of times by nymphomaniac women, a victimhood apparently that offsets his victimizing?

In the most macabre sense, think of the doomed Mary Jo Kopechne thrashing about in a sunken car, fighting for her young life, as the drunken driver and perpetrator — Ted Kennedy — sulked about on shore, worrying only about losing his Camelot career.

Think of Charlie Rose’s victims who described the “fury” of his advances and his “animalistic” tactics. One victim said that Rose grabbed her hair and twisted her neck; another found herself trapped in his country house without transportation home, crying as Rose grew angry that she had not welcomed his sexual exhibitionism.

Think of the similar sick exhibitionism of a Conyers or Weinstein. Both deliberately walked about in their underwear or in open robes, glaring at their grossed-out targets as they reacted negatively to their phallic exposure. (After how many terms in office, or after how many hit movies, did Conyers or Weinstein decide it was now an uplifting experience for a female subordinate to catch sight of his male organ?)

Think of a Mark Halperin allegedly pressing a woman against a window, or masturbating behind a desk as he leered at her.

The streak of malice is so frequent in all these allegations that it becomes a theme.

Did the callousness result from the idea that such important men had a strict timetable, with not a second to be wasted by romance or even rudimentary expressions of professionalism and friendship? But why did they not even feign liking the women they coerced?

Are feminist theoreticians on to something when they say that in these cases of sexual assault, physical gratification is only part of the equation (sometimes a small part) — that the real impetus might be the sadism of nastily humiliating someone judged weaker?

I grew up on a farm and live there now, and for over half a century, I’ve at various times been surrounded by dogs, donkeys, horses, cows, and wild animals ranging from hawks to coyotes. One notices over the decades how animals eat and couple.

They are utilitarian and in the human sense selfish to the core. The animal does not know where its next meal comes from, and so he bites, growls, and attacks any rival who gets too close as he almost instantaneously gulps down or swallows whole his meal.

In matters of sex, the male animal, after an occasional rudimentary display of intention, simply approaches his target and attempts to mount; if he faces too much opposition, he tries again later or approaches another target. There is, of course, a Darwinian explanation for animal behavior. But humans are supposed to have developed over the centuries a civilized culture to repress our innate selfishness and cruelty in matters of food and sex.

These men seemed to have enjoyed reverting to their premodern reptilian selves. Do they revert all the more easily to their instincts also because there are few marshals to take them down?

In the old days, for every Weinstein or Charlie Rose, there would have been a get-even husband, outraged dad, family friend, big brother, or furious boyfriend who would have cornered the cowardly assaulter.

In the old days, for every Weinstein or Charlie Rose, there would have been a get-even husband, outraged dad, family friend, big brother, or furious boyfriend who would have cornered the cowardly assaulter (called out as a “punk” or “bully”), and either knocked his block off or dressed him down. I once saw a tough old World War II veteran walk up and grab a stunned prominent local judge, raise him over his head, shake him good a few times, and say, “Listen, knock it off bothering my wife.”

But is all that “toxic” masculinity now passé — killed off by the chaos of the Sixties and the assurances that the deep state could handle harassment? Women, we are told, don’t need deluded Gary Coopers or condescending Jimmy Stewarts around to open doors, pick up the tab, or play their historic chivalrous roles in protecting women from the cruel men among them.

But the malicious men currently in the news knew that too often the slow-coach Human Resources Department would merely catalogue their assaults and weigh the costs and benefits of endangering the careers of rich, powerful, famous predators.

Given that fact, lots of cowards like Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, or Harvey Weinstein did what all cruel bullies do. They attacked and humiliated the vulnerable without worry of repercussions — and they did so with wanton meanness apparently as sick relish.

To get legal help, Tara Reade reached out to Time’s Up, established in the wake of the #MeToo movement to help survivors tell their stories.

As the campaign went on, Reade, who first supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren and then Sen. Bernie Sanders, began to reconsider staying silent. She thought about the world she wanted her daughter to live in and decided that she wanted to continue telling her story and push back against what she saw as online defamation. To get legal help, and manage what she knew from her first go-around would be serious backlash, she reached out to the organization Time’s Up, established in the wake of the #MeToo movement to help survivors tell their stories. The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund was the recipient of an outpouring of donations over the past two-plus years, and is set up as a 501(c)3 nonprofit housed within the National Women’s Law Center. It was launched in December 2017 and was the most successful GoFundMe in the site’s history, raising more than $24 million. Among the accusers backed so far by Time’s Up are some of those assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, as well scores of others with allegations against executives in male-dominated industries. The group has committed more than $10 million toward funding cases. In January of this year, Reade spoke with a program director at NWLC and was encouraged by the conversation. The fact that she was a Sanders supporter and had come forward previously in incomplete fashion didn’t dissuade Time’s Up. The program director referred her to outside attorneys, Reade said, and suggested that the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund might be able to provide funding for PR and subsidize legal assistance. The program director shared with Reade the note she planned to forward to attorneys, which read, in part: She began publicly sharing the harassment she experienced in April 2019 but was attacked … online including by Richard Painter (Univ. of MN law professor who worked in the Obama administration) and journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere for being a Russian operative. There is more to the story of the harassment that she did not feel safe sharing at that time. She is looking for support in sharing her story and guidance on any possible legal action she may be able to take against online harassers. [Editor’s note: Painter served in the Bush, not Obama, administration, and ran for Senate in 2018 as a Democrat.] The references to Dovere, a reporter with The Atlantic, and Painter stem from their Twitter posts that highlighted favorable comments Reade had made about Putin in a now-deleted post on Medium. “What if I told you that everything you learned about Russia was wrong?” she had written in one 2018 post. “President Putin scares the power elite in America because he is a compassionate, caring, visionary leader. … To President Putin, I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do, with eyes of love. To all my Russian friends, happy holiday and Happy New Year.”

Reade says that she learned about Russia and Putin through a Russian friend in her creative-writing group; she is currently writing a novel set in Russia. She wrote the post in the spirit of world peace and solidarity with her friend, she said, adding that the writing should have nothing to do with her allegation. Reade’s leftist mother had raised her to oppose American imperialism and be skeptical of American exceptionalism. She hoped that Time’s Up would be able to help push back against the attacks she knew would be coming.

sexual_misconduct,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/14/donald-wuerl-vatican-covered-catholic-church-pries/,"Catholic officials, Vatican systematically covered up priest sex abuse, report reveals",2018-08-14,Laura Kelly,"A landmark grand jury report says hundreds of priests preyed on boys and girls in six Pennsylvania dioceses , where at least 1,000 were sexually assaulted over decades as top church officials , including Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl , archbishop of Washington , and the Vatican systematically worked to cover it up .
At almost 900 pages , the exhaustive report details methods by leaders of the dioceses to insulate accused members of the church from outside prosecution and judgment — employing the same strategies uncovered by The Boston Globe ’ s 2002 report on the systematic cover-up of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church .
The investigating team received files on at least 100 other priests but didn ’ t include them in the report for lack of sufficient evidence . The actual number of child victims is believed to be in the thousands , the jurors wrote , but there is no information because they either didn ’ t come forward or the dioceses didn ’ t create written records for all times they heard of the abuse .
The six dioceses — Allentown , Erie , Greensburg , Harrisburg , Pittsburgh and Scranton — serve nearly 1.6 million Catholics in Pennsylvania .
In 1993 , Cardinal Wuerl , then bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh , coined the term “ circle of secrecy ” to describe the methods in place to protect accused members of the church , according to the report .
The cardinal denies he came up with that term , according to the spokesman for the Washington Archdiocese .
This included downplaying accusations of rape and molestation with euphemisms like “ horseplay ” and “ wrestling , ” transferring accused priests around the country or placing them on “ health leave ” while keeping them on the church payroll — at times to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars . In some instances , accused sexual abusers were promoted .
Other methods included covering costs of victims related to medical and psychological care and settlements to victims with the signing of a confidentiality agreement .
Cardinal Wuerl on Tuesday defended his role in the church at the time .
“ While I understand this report may be critical of some of my actions , I believe the report confirms that I acted with diligence , with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse , ” the archbishop said in a statement before the grand jury was released . “ I sincerely hope that a just assessment of my actions , past and present , and my continuing commitment to the protection of children will dispel any notions otherwise made by this report . ”
The report ’ s effect on the Pennsylvania dioceses , as well as the Vatican , could be seismic and costly . The Archdiocese of Boston in 2002 paid $ 10 million to victims of a priest who had abused more than 130 children during his tenure and in 2003 paid $ 85 million to victims and their parents who had filed lawsuits over the abuse . The scandal also resulted in the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law .
On Tuesday , Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro detailed graphic stories of victims of sexual abuse that occurred over decades , some stretching back as far as the early 1950s and continuing into the late 2000s .
The report took two years to compile based on victim testimony and a half-million internal documents subpoenaed from the church .
“ These documents , from the diocese ’ s own ‘ secret archives , ’ formed the backbone of this investigation , ” said Mr. Shapiro , adding that internal communications from the church corroborated victim testimonies and illustrated the extent of the cover-up , which reached the Vatican .
Church officials referred to the written reports of abuse as “ secret archives , ” said Mr. Shapiro , indicating their complacency in the cover-up .
“ In each diocese , the bishops had the key to the ‘ secret archives , ’ which contained both allegations and admissions of the abuse and cover-up , ” he said .
More than a dozen victims and family members of victims joined the attorney general Tuesday for a press conference in Harrisburg , crying and leaning on one another for comfort as details of sexual assaults by priests on children were made public .
This included a disturbing report of four “ predator priests ” in the Pittsburgh diocese who “ groomed and violently assaulted young boys , ” Mr. Shapiro said . One boy was forced to stand naked on a bed in the rectory , posing as Christ on the cross while these priests took photos of him . The pictures were added to a collection of child pornography and shared on church grounds .
These same predators gifted their favored victims with gold crosses to wear as necklaces , marking which boys had been groomed for abuse , the report said .
“ Predators in every diocese weaponized the Catholic faith and used it as a tool of their abuse , ” Mr. Shapiro said .
The grand jury recommended that criminal and civil statutes of limitations on sexual abuse in Pennsylvania be reformed to prosecute the detailed allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades past . They wrote that the systematic cover-up allowed for the statute of limitations to expire before victims and law enforcement could hold perpetrators accountable .
However , at least two instances uncovered by the jury ’ s investigation led to charges against priests .
Last month , Catholic priest John Sweeney of Greensburg pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in the early 1990s . Sweeney served as a priest for 16 years and in various parishes , according to the attorney general ’ s office .
In Erie , the Rev . David Poulson awaits trial on charges of sexually abusing two boys over many years . State prosecutors also say Poulson ’ s superior , Bishop Donald Trautman , knew about and covered up the abuse .
Cardinal Wuerl , as Pittsburgh ’ s bishop , had served the longest term as head of the diocese and personally dealt with at least 25 of the 99 accused priests .
He assumed leadership in Pittsburgh in 1988 and a year later drafted a letter to the Vatican raising concerns about a number of high-profile sexual abuse allegations against priests and what role the church should play in assuming responsibility and dealing with the accused .
He called for transparency among Catholic leaders , for them to tell one another that if a transferred priest had been accused of sexual assault , that they had a responsibility to their parishioners , who “ would be gravely unsettled and scandalized ” that a “ priest pedophile has been assigned in their midst , ” the report cited the cardinal as writing .
Despite this early attempt at a culture shift , Cardinal Wuerl presided over the reassignment of accused pedophiles to other churches and schools , positions where they were expected to interact with children . At times , he did discourage reassignments and encouraged resignations , but he approved the church ’ s stipends for the men and in some cases health insurance .
He was promoted to cardinal in 2006 and took over leadership of the Archdiocese of Washington .
Over the past two weeks , the cardinal has been dealing with the fallout of his predecessor , Theodore E. McCarrick , who was stripped of his title by the pope at the end of July after allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades earlier .
“ I think everyone recognizes that words , good intentions , and new policies , while important , are not enough , ” Cardinal Wuerl wrote in a post on the website of the Archdiocese of Washington . “ We must not only denounce abuse and take steps to stop the abusers . We must remove even the appearance of cover-ups as we investigate and address allegations . ”","A landmark grand jury report says hundreds of priests preyed on boys and girls in six Pennsylvania dioceses, where at least 1,000 were sexually assaulted over decades as top church officials, including Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, and the Vatican systematically worked to cover it up.

At almost 900 pages, the exhaustive report details methods by leaders of the dioceses to insulate accused members of the church from outside prosecution and judgment — employing the same strategies uncovered by The Boston Globe’s 2002 report on the systematic cover-up of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.

The investigating team received files on at least 100 other priests but didn’t include them in the report for lack of sufficient evidence. The actual number of child victims is believed to be in the thousands, the jurors wrote, but there is no information because they either didn’t come forward or the dioceses didn’t create written records for all times they heard of the abuse.

The six dioceses — Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton — serve nearly 1.6 million Catholics in Pennsylvania.

In 1993, Cardinal Wuerl, then bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, coined the term “circle of secrecy” to describe the methods in place to protect accused members of the church, according to the report.

The cardinal denies he came up with that term, according to the spokesman for the Washington Archdiocese.

This included downplaying accusations of rape and molestation with euphemisms like “horseplay” and “wrestling,” transferring accused priests around the country or placing them on “health leave” while keeping them on the church payroll — at times to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. In some instances, accused sexual abusers were promoted.

Other methods included covering costs of victims related to medical and psychological care and settlements to victims with the signing of a confidentiality agreement.

Cardinal Wuerl on Tuesday defended his role in the church at the time.

“While I understand this report may be critical of some of my actions, I believe the report confirms that I acted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse,” the archbishop said in a statement before the grand jury was released. “I sincerely hope that a just assessment of my actions, past and present, and my continuing commitment to the protection of children will dispel any notions otherwise made by this report.”

The report’s effect on the Pennsylvania dioceses, as well as the Vatican, could be seismic and costly. The Archdiocese of Boston in 2002 paid $10 million to victims of a priest who had abused more than 130 children during his tenure and in 2003 paid $85 million to victims and their parents who had filed lawsuits over the abuse. The scandal also resulted in the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law.

On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro detailed graphic stories of victims of sexual abuse that occurred over decades, some stretching back as far as the early 1950s and continuing into the late 2000s.

The report took two years to compile based on victim testimony and a half-million internal documents subpoenaed from the church.

“These documents, from the diocese’s own ‘secret archives,’ formed the backbone of this investigation,” said Mr. Shapiro, adding that internal communications from the church corroborated victim testimonies and illustrated the extent of the cover-up, which reached the Vatican.

Church officials referred to the written reports of abuse as “secret archives,” said Mr. Shapiro, indicating their complacency in the cover-up.

“In each diocese, the bishops had the key to the ‘secret archives,’ which contained both allegations and admissions of the abuse and cover-up,” he said.

More than a dozen victims and family members of victims joined the attorney general Tuesday for a press conference in Harrisburg, crying and leaning on one another for comfort as details of sexual assaults by priests on children were made public.

This included a disturbing report of four “predator priests” in the Pittsburgh diocese who “groomed and violently assaulted young boys,” Mr. Shapiro said. One boy was forced to stand naked on a bed in the rectory, posing as Christ on the cross while these priests took photos of him. The pictures were added to a collection of child pornography and shared on church grounds.

These same predators gifted their favored victims with gold crosses to wear as necklaces, marking which boys had been groomed for abuse, the report said.

“Predators in every diocese weaponized the Catholic faith and used it as a tool of their abuse,” Mr. Shapiro said.

The grand jury recommended that criminal and civil statutes of limitations on sexual abuse in Pennsylvania be reformed to prosecute the detailed allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades past. They wrote that the systematic cover-up allowed for the statute of limitations to expire before victims and law enforcement could hold perpetrators accountable.

However, at least two instances uncovered by the jury’s investigation led to charges against priests.

Last month, Catholic priest John Sweeney of Greensburg pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in the early 1990s. Sweeney served as a priest for 16 years and in various parishes, according to the attorney general’s office.

In Erie, the Rev. David Poulson awaits trial on charges of sexually abusing two boys over many years. State prosecutors also say Poulson’s superior, Bishop Donald Trautman, knew about and covered up the abuse.

Cardinal Wuerl, as Pittsburgh’s bishop, had served the longest term as head of the diocese and personally dealt with at least 25 of the 99 accused priests.

He assumed leadership in Pittsburgh in 1988 and a year later drafted a letter to the Vatican raising concerns about a number of high-profile sexual abuse allegations against priests and what role the church should play in assuming responsibility and dealing with the accused.

He called for transparency among Catholic leaders, for them to tell one another that if a transferred priest had been accused of sexual assault, that they had a responsibility to their parishioners, who “would be gravely unsettled and scandalized” that a “priest pedophile has been assigned in their midst,” the report cited the cardinal as writing.

Despite this early attempt at a culture shift, Cardinal Wuerl presided over the reassignment of accused pedophiles to other churches and schools, positions where they were expected to interact with children. At times, he did discourage reassignments and encouraged resignations, but he approved the church’s stipends for the men and in some cases health insurance.

He was promoted to cardinal in 2006 and took over leadership of the Archdiocese of Washington.

Over the past two weeks, the cardinal has been dealing with the fallout of his predecessor, Theodore E. McCarrick, who was stripped of his title by the pope at the end of July after allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades earlier.

“I think everyone recognizes that words, good intentions, and new policies, while important, are not enough,” Cardinal Wuerl wrote in a post on the website of the Archdiocese of Washington. “We must not only denounce abuse and take steps to stop the abusers. We must remove even the appearance of cover-ups as we investigate and address allegations.”

In a `` Larry King Live '' segment that aired on August 11 , 1993 , on CNN , an unnamed woman calls in to the show with her location identified on the screen as San Luis Obispo , California . The show was about the cutthroat nature of Washington , DC , politics and media .
`` Yes , hello . I 'm wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington ? '' she asks . `` My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . ''
Larry King responds : `` In other words , she had a story to tell but out of respect for the person she worked for , she did n't tell it ? ''
The woman does not mention sexual assault or harassment , nor does she describe in any detail what `` problems '' she might be referring to . Her daughter 's name and Biden are also not mentioned .
In a phone interview with CNN Friday night , Reade told CNN that she is certain the voice in the video belongs to her mother , Jeanette Altimus , who died a few years ago .
`` I 've been crying because I have n't heard my mom 's voice in a few years . So it 's been a little emotional , '' Reade said . `` I miss her . I miss her voice . ''
CNN separately confirmed that Altimus lived in San Luis Obispo around the time of the newly surfaced clip from `` Larry King Live . '' The Intercept first reported on the interview .
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the video , referring CNN to statements it previously released denying Reade 's sexual assault allegation . Those statements include one from Biden 's executive assistant at the time of the allegation who said she never received any complaints .
CNN had previously reached out to Reade multiple times but she had not agreed to be interviewed prior to Friday . In that phone interview , she shared similar details of the sexual assault allegation she had told in recent weeks to multiple media outlets , including The New York Times Washington Post and the Associated Press .
She told CNN that in 1993 , when she was working as an aide in Biden 's Senate office , she was asked to deliver a duffle bag to the then-Delaware senator . In a corridor somewhere in the Capitol Hill complex , Reade said Biden `` had me up against the wall ; he used his knee to spread open my legs , '' and `` put his fingers inside me . ''
Reade said when she pulled away , Biden said to her , `` Come on man . I heard -- I thought you liked me . '' Biden then looked angry , according to Reade , and said , `` You are nothing to me . You are nothing . '' She said that Biden eventually took her by the shoulders and said words to the effect of , `` You 're OK. You 're fine , '' before walking away .
Reade said on the night of the alleged assault she spoke on the phone with her mother , who was `` adamant '' that she call the police . She said she did not call the police . Reade said she recalls her mother telling her sometime after the alleged assault that she had called into Larry King 's show .
`` I think what makes me emotional is that I was really hard on her and I said , 'Why would you do that , it 's scary to me , ' '' Reade told CNN . `` I had told her not to do that and she did and she did it on her own and I know now . I wish I could go back and I could hug her and say thank you for being a good mom and trying to protect me . ''
The New York Times spoke with a friend of Reade 's , who said Reade had told her about the alleged assault at the time ; a second friend said Reade told her in 2008 that Biden had touched her inappropriately . The Times said it also had spoken with nearly two dozen people who worked with Biden in the early 1990s , and none corroborated Reade 's allegation .
The Washington Post interviewed Reade 's brother , Collin Moulton , who told the paper that she had told him in 1993 that Biden had `` behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders '' but not about the alleged sexual assault . Several days after that interview with Reade 's brother , the Post said , `` he said in a text message that he recalled her telling him that Biden had put his hand 'under her clothes . ' ''
Reached by text message on Saturday , Moulton told CNN that Reade told him in the early 1990s that she had been asked to bring Biden his gym bag , and that in a private setting , he had cornered her against the wall and put his hands under her clothes .
`` My mom wanted her to go to the police , '' he said .
Moulton also said he remembered Reade telling him that she had been asked to serve drinks at an event for Biden because she had `` nice legs , '' and that Biden had touched her shoulders and neck .
Reade told the Times that she had filed a complaint about Biden with the Senate in 1993 but that she did not have a copy of it ; the Times said it could not locate it .
Reade filed a police report in Washington about the alleged assault earlier this month . CNN obtained the incident report from DC police -- it states that `` Subject-1 disclosed that she was the victim of a sexual assault which was committed by Subject-2 in 1993 . ''
Last year , Reade had publicly alleged that Biden had made her feel uncomfortable by touching her neck and shoulders . Reade told CNN that this resulted in death threats , and that a victim advocate had advised her to speak to the police .
In a statement provided to CNN , Biden 's deputy campaign manager and communications director , Kate Bedingfield , denied Reade 's allegation , calling it `` untrue . ''
`` Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women . He authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act . He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard - and heard respectfully , '' Bedingfield said . `` Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press . What is clear about this claim : it is untrue . This absolutely did not happen . ''
The campaign also shared a statement from Marianne Baker , who was Biden 's executive assistant in the 1980s and 1990s when he was a senator . Reade told the Times that she had complained to Baker and two other aides about harassment by Biden , but not about the alleged assault .
`` In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period -- not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone . I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade 's accounting of events , which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional , and as a manager , '' Baker said . `` These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades . ''
Baker also said that dozens of employees had reported to her over the years , and that Biden himself had fostered `` a professional workplace '' environment in his Senate office .
Last year , multiple women publicly came forward to say that Biden had made them feel uncomfortable in the way that he physically interacted with them . None of them accused him of sexual assault .
The New York Times reported that it recently interviewed the women who made these complaints and that `` they did not have any new information about their experiences to add , '' but that several of them said they believed Reade 's new allegation .
Lucy Flores , a former Nevada assemblywoman , described an encounter with Biden in 2014 where she said he had made her feel `` uneasy , gross and confused '' by coming up from behind her and kissing the back of her head .
At the time , Biden said that in all of his years as a public figure , `` not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately . If it is suggested I did so , I will listen respectfully . But it was never my intention . ''

And yet there is still progressive outrage over the new Title IX rules developed by DeVos that seek to bring balance and fairness to the consideration of accusations against people who aren’t the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.

A piece from Vox on what “believe women” means in the context of Reade’s allegation quoted Sage Carson, manager of an advocacy organization called Know Your IX. According to Carson, the concept has been twisted “into this idea that you never provide a fair process for folks to go through.”

But her organization has declared war on DeVos’s changes.

An article in Mother Jones reported that anti-sexual-assault activists still supporting Biden have a number of reasons. One of them is “an eagerness to replace Trump’s cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose overhaul of campus sexual assault policy has prompted outcry from survivors.”

The DeVos changes are meant to inject elementary fairness into proceedings that went off the rails in response to Obama-administration guidance in 2011. Students punished by these kangaroo courts have had considerable success appealing their cases in the courts.

The DeVos rules reverse the single-investigator model that empowered one person to investigate a case and recommend a decision.

Now the investigator and adjudicator must be different. Students must have access to evidence, and the accused must know what is alleged and by whom and when.

There must be a live hearing and an opportunity for cross-examination by both sides.

Title IX coordinators and investigators can’t be biased one way or the other.

These measures are so in keeping with basic American traditions that it’s hard to believe that anyone could oppose them.

The ultimate irony is that Joe Biden was a prime mover behind the Obama-era Title IX rules. As Robby Soave of Reason magazine notes, “If the allegation against Biden were being decided by the kind of adjudication system that he helped enshrine on college campuses, it’s quite likely that he would be found guilty.”

If the term ""jump the shark"" didn't already exist, it would need to be invented to describe the state of the #MeToo movement after the publication of (and lavish praise for) a lengthy essay recounting the lurid details of one woman's bad date with comedian Aziz Ansari.

Already, a growing list of writers — Cathy Young, Masha Gessen, Daphne Merkin, Margaret Atwood, and Andrew Sullivan — had begun to raise concerns about the danger of the movement going too far, engaging in witch hunts, displaying disregard for due process, and imposing prudish Puritanical standards on sexual interactions. But with the Ansari essay, published on the website Babe.net, we've entered new territory.

The essay, which author Caitlin Flanagan aptly describes at The Atlantic as ""3,000 words of revenge porn,"" recounts the story of a 23-year-old photographer who eagerly went on a date with Ansari last September, accompanied him back to his apartment after a rushed dinner out, and then engaged in a complicated series of graphically described and exceedingly awkward sexual interactions with him. Eventually the woman (given the pseudonym ""Grace"" to conceal her identity) fled his apartment in tears. The following day, when Ansari texted to say he'd had a good time, she sent Ansari a text message in which she admitted her discomfort with his behavior the night before, and he rather cluelessly apologized.

That, apparently, was it — until the story of the date appeared online, insinuating that Ansari is guilty of … well, the story never really says. If its account of his behavior is accurate, then he certainly acted like a self-involved, sex-obsessed creep for much of the date. Lacking a word to describe such behavior, many have resorted to calling it ""sexual misconduct.""

In a workplace, expectations regarding interactions among employees are clearly defined by law and binding regulations. That makes it possible to define sexual misconduct with some precision as a violation of those expectations. But Grace didn't work for Ansari, and they weren't coworkers. He had no authority over her at all (beyond the authority she may have invested in him by virtue of his celebrity). In that open-ended context of two people who decided to go home together, describing his actions as ""sexual misconduct"" sounds vaguely Orwellian — as a transgression against norms that are presumed to be binding on all despite the fact that they have yet to be defined.

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano also accused the Pope of covering up reports of sexual abuse by a US cardinal .
The pontiff was asked about the accusations by reporters on his flight back to Rome after this weekend 's Papal visit to Ireland .
He said he would not say a single word in response to the 11-page letter from Archbishop Vigano .
`` I will say sincerely that I must say this , to you , '' he said , when asked by a journalist about the letter , `` and all of you who are interested : Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves .
`` I will not say one word on this . I think the statement speaks for itself . ''
The timing of the letter , released as the Pope addressed sexual abuse by priests during his visit to Ireland , has raised questions about whether Pope Francis is facing a coordinated attack from traditionalists within the Catholic hierarchy .
`` You have sufficient journalistic capacity to draw conclusions , '' Pope Francis told the reporters on board his plane .
`` When a little time has passed and you have the conclusions , perhaps I will talk , '' he added .
He says the pontiff knew about allegations of sex abuse by a prominent US cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month .
Archbishop Vigano says he told Pope Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexually abusing lower-ranking seminarians and priests .
The Pope `` knew from at least June 23 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator '' . , wrote Archbishop Vigano , adding that `` he knew that he was a corrupt man , he covered for him to the bitter end '' .
`` Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick 's abuses and resign along with all of them , '' the letter says .
However , Archbishop Vigano has not produced any written or other evidence to verify his alleged 2013 conversation with the Pope .
He served as the Vatican 's envoy in Washington from 2011 until 2016 .

The Pope 's informal leadership , baptising a baby on the street and even marrying a couple during a flight , has concerned some traditionalists and his document about the family - Amoris Laetitia - provoked four cardinals to release a series of queries that became known as `` dubia '' .
Archbishop Vigano is known to be an ally of the so called dubia cardinals , who have publicly challenged Pope Francis to correct his teaching on family life - and have suggested that there may be occasions when a Pope should be challenged and disobeyed .

How did the Pope address sexual abuse during his visit to Ireland ?
At a Mass on Sunday in Dublin 's Phoenix Park , the culmination of his two-day visit to Ireland , Pope Francis begged forgiveness for the `` abuses in Ireland , abuses of power , conscience and sexual abuses '' perpetrated by Church leaders .
Earlier , he said no-one could fail to be moved by stories of those who `` suffered abuse , were robbed of their innocence and left scarred by painful memories '' , and reiterated his wish to see justice served .
Pope Francis used the penitential rite of the Mass to list a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by Church figures , and the cover-ups of sex crimes .
On each occasion he asked for forgiveness , the congregation - estimated by the Vatican to number 300,000 - applauded .
The Irish Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests , sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages , and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes .

Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been released on $1 million bail, following his arraignment Friday.

He was charged in Manhattan court with rape, criminal sex act and other sex charges stemming from encounters with two women.

Accused by more than 80 women, Weinstein surrendered to the New York Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney's office Friday morning.

At the arraignment, Weinstein agreed to wear an electronic monitoring device, paid for at his own expense.

Weinstein was instructed he could only travel in New York state and Connecticut. Should he desire to go to another state, he has to seek permission. Weinstein has received a grand jury notice and by May 30 will opt to testify or not.

The victim has received an order of protection and will be identified to the court, prosecution and defense but will otherwise remain anonymous.

The next hearing is scheduled for July 30.

Weinstein turned himself in at NYPD's 1st Precinct around 7:30 a.m ET. Carrying books the AP identified as Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway Revolution and Elia Kazan about the stage and film director in his right hand, Weinstein was noticeably struggling to walk. He hobbled into the precinct clad in a dark blazer and white-collared shirt beneath a blue sweater.

Weinstein left the station before 9 a.m. in handcuffs headed to court for his arraignment.

As Weinstein headed into the courthouse, AP reports he was questioned by the crowd. ""You sorry, Harvey?"" someone shouted. The question ""What can you say?"" was also raised. In reply, Weinstein softly shook his head and answered ""No.""

Weinstein has consistently denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Friday that he would fight to get the charges dismissed, saying they're factually unsupported and constitutionally flawed.

Brafman issued a statement to USA TODAY following Friday's proceedings, reiterating his client's stance. ""Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone. Nothing about today's proceedings changes Mr. Weinstein's position. He has entered a plea of not guilty and fully expects to be exonerated.""

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. also thanked the Weinstein's claimants for their courage in a statement shared to Twitter on Friday. ""Thank you to the brave survivors who have come forward, our office’s tireless prosecutors, and our dedicated partners at @NYPDNews,"" he shared before urging those with additional accounts or information to reach out.

When discussing the accusations facing his client, Brafman reminded reporters Friday his job isn’t “to defend behavior; my job is to defend something that is criminal behavior.”

“Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood,” he declared, “and to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about. Bad behavior is not on trial in this case; it’s only if you intentionally committed a criminal act, and Mr. Weinstein vigorously denies that.”

Friday's events come nearly eight months after The New York Times exposed three decades of alleged sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to rape from accusers including Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o and Gwyneth Paltrow. Soon afterward, Weinstein decamped to Arizona to seek treatment.

Weinstein has been under investigation for months in New York, Los Angeles and London.

Several of the actresses who have made allegations against Weinstein, including McGowan and Annabella Sciorra, applauded his impending arrest on social media.

“The justice system has been something very elusive,” McGowan said. “I hope in this case it works. Because it’s all true. None of this was consensual.”

Weinstein became a larger-than-life figure in Hollywood as co-founder of the ""mini-major"" studios Miramax (started in 1979) and The Weinstein Company (2005), producing and distributing awards-friendly films such as Oscar best-picture winners The Artist and The King’s Speech.

The domineering studio head amassed tremendous influence with his strong personality, his ability to identify and champion artistic projects and his track record of Oscar success — the latter cemented when Weinstein's Shakespeare in Love was a shock best-picture winner over Steven Spielberg's heavily favored Saving Private Ryan in 1999.

The Weinstein scandal has triggered a cascade of accusations against Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Morgan Freeman, among others.

sexual_misconduct,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mitchell-richardson-accused,Disgraced money man's alleged sex trafficking victim names 2 prominent Dems in newly released docs,,Brooke Singman,"A woman who has long claimed disgraced money man Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with powerful men named two prominent Democratic politicians - former Sen. George Mitchell and ex-New Mexico governor and Clinton cabinet official Bill Richardson - in documents unsealed Friday by federal prosecutors in New York .
Friday 's revelations came from more than 2,000 documents that were unsealed by the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the Southern District of New York . The papers included affidavits and depositions of key witnesses in a lawsuit the now-33-year-old woman , Virginia Roberts Giuffre , filed against Epstein and his associate , Ghislane Maxwell in 2015 . Giuffre accused the duo of keeping her as a “ sex slave ” in the early 2000s when she was underage .
Giuffre claimed in a May 2016 deposition to have been trafficked to have sex with and provide erotic massages to powerful politicians , foreign leaders and well-heeled businessmen . In ordering the documents released , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also warned that the allegations contained within them are not necessarily proven .
Giuffre alleged in her own deposition that she was allegedly forced to have sex with Richardson , 71 , Britain ’ s Prince Andrew , Hedge Fund manager Glenn Dubin , American scientist Marvin Minsky , “ another prince , ” “ a large hotel chain owner , ” Stephen Kauffman , and model scout Jean Luc Brunell .
In another deposition , Giuffre also reveals that she was “ trafficked ” to Mitchell , a former Senate Majority leader who represented Maine from 1980-95 and was later named special envoy to the Middle East by President Obama . A sworn affidavit by a former Epstein employee , Juan Alessi , also alleges Mitchell , 85 , of having associated with Epstein .
“ The allegation contained in the released documents is false , ” Mitchell said in a statement to Fox News . “ I have never met , spoken with or had any contact with Ms. Giuffre . ”
He added : “ In my contacts with Mr. Epstein I never observed or suspected any inappropriate conduct with underage girls . I only learned of his actions when they were reported in the media related to his prosecution in Florida . We have had no further contact . ”
A spokesperson for Richardson denied the allegations , telling Fox News in a statement Friday that they are “ completely false . ”
“ Governor Richardson has never even been contacted by any party regarding this lawsuit , ” the spokesperson said . “ To be clear , in Governor Richardson ’ s limited interactions with Mr. Epstein , he never saw him in the presence of young or underage girls . Governor Richardson has never been to Mr. Epstein ’ s residence in the Virgin Islands . Governor Richardson has never met Ms. Giuffre . ”
“ Glenn and Eva Dubin are outraged by the allegations in the unsealed court records , which are demonstrably false and defamatory , ” the spokesman said in a statement to Fox News Friday . “ The Dubins have flight records and other evidence that definitively disprove that any such events occurred . ”
Giuffre also has long-claimed that Epstein forced her to have sex with Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz . In the newly-revealed documents , Giuffre , who was at the time labeled as “ Jane Doe # 3 , ” claimed that Epstein required her to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor . Giuffre claimed to have had the encounters in Florida , on private planes , in New York , New Mexico , and in the U.S. Virgin Islands .
The documents also reveal that Giuffre allegedly had sexual relations with Prince Andrew in three separate locations—Maxwell ’ s London apartment , New York , and Epstein ’ s private island , Little St. James , in the U.S. Virgin Islands .
Giuffre also claimed to have had sex with Brunel in numerous locations , including West Palm Beach , Little St. James Island , New York City , New Mexico , Paris , the South of France , and California .
Meanwhile , included in the hundreds of pages of documents were pages of flight logs from Epstein ’ s private jet . Prominent individuals who had traveled on the jet , according to those records , included Bill Gates , who flew once , former President Bill Clinton and aide Doug Band , who flew four times , President Trump , who flew once in 1997 from Palm Beach to New York , Colombian President Andres Pastrana , Dershowitz , Hyatt Hotels Chairman Tom Pritzker , Brunel , and model and talent agent Naomi Campbell , among others .
Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy last month in New York . Epstein , 66 , is accused of having preyed on dozens of victims as young as 14 .
Epstein allegedly created and maintained a “ vast network ” and operation from 2002 “ up to and including ” at least 2005 that enabled him to “ sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls ” in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls . Prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform massages on Epstein .
“ The victims , who were as young as 14 years of age , were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the ‘ massage ’ , ” prosecutors wrote . “ During the encounter , Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include , among other things , sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim ’ s genitals . ”
Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees .
EPSTEIN HAD HELP OPERATING SEX TRAFFICKING RING FROM WOMEN HE ALLEGEDLY COERCED
Prosecutors also allege that Epstein “ worked and conspired with others , including employees and associates ” who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein at his mansion in New York City and in Palm Beach , Fla .
Giuffre claims that Maxwell was one of those associates . Giuffre has accused Maxwell as being Epstein ’ s madam who allegedly approached her in 1999 when she was just 15 . Maxwell , 57 , is the daughter of Robert Maxwell , a disgraced publishing mogul who was accused of theft from his company ’ s pension funds to prevent bankruptcy . Maxwell was born and raised in England and immigrated to America in 1991 , and became a fixture in the New York social scene . Maxwell has been photographed over the years at events with Prince Andrew , the Clintons and Trump . Maxwell dated Epstein for a short period of time before becoming close friends .
Epstein ’ s arrest came amid renewed scrutiny of a once-secret plea deal that ended a federal investigation against him .
That deal , which has been challenged in Florida federal court , allowed Epstein , 66 , to plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under age 18 for prostitution .
The plea deal was brokered with the help of then-U.S. attorney in Florida Alexander Acosta . The deal was criticized as lenient because Epstein could have faced a life sentence .
Last month , Acosta , who served as secretary of Labor for Trump , resigned from his post amid renewed scrutiny over the deal .","A woman who has long claimed disgraced money man Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with powerful men named two prominent Democratic politicians - former Sen.

Many states still treat spousal rape differently





Four decades after the start of the movement to criminalize spousal rape, states are still updating their statutes. This year, Minnesota eliminated its marital exemption for rape cases in which the victim is incapacitated. Bills to remove martial exemptions in Ohio and Maryland both died in committee. Meanwhile, states that specifically criminalize spousal rape treat the crime differently in some respects: California requires people convicted under its law to register as sex offenders, but only if they used “force or violence” and were sentenced to state prison.

The particulars of Sigh’s spousal rape conviction in 1993 and subsequent move to Massachusetts allowed him to avoid registering as a sex offender. No longer: In June, a Massachusetts jury convicted Sigh of rape, kidnapping, stalking, witness intimidation, and other crimes in connection with sexually assaulting his estranged wife in December 2017.",www.motherjones.com,left,n12YdxSWZ5DZp5mg

More than a month after being publicly accused of sexual assault by a former Senate staffer in the 1990s , former Vice President Joe Biden says the allegations `` are n't true . This never happened . ''
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has also called on Senate records to be released of a sexual harassment complaint former Senate staffer Tara Reade says she filed , though she says it did not detail an assault and does not have a copy herself . Biden said he would n't call on the University of Delaware to search for Reade 's alleged complaint in his official senatorial records , kept at the university under seal , saying those files do not contain personnel records .
Biden released a statement Friday morning shortly before a live television interview with MSNBC . The statement and interview were the candidate 's first direct response to the allegations by Reade .
In the statement , Biden seeks to walk the line between respecting and listening to the sexual assault allegations — a hallmark of most Democrats ' response to the # MeToo movement — and defending himself .
`` While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated , two things are not complicated , '' Biden said in the statement . `` One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect , and when they step forward they should be heard , not silenced . The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny . Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story , which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways . ''
`` I 'm not going to question her motive , '' Biden said in the interview with MSNBC 's Mika Brzezinski . `` I 'm not going to do that at all . I do n't know why she 's saying this . I do n't know why after 27 years this gets raised . ''
Reade says that Biden assaulted her in the spring of 1993 , when she worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office . Reade could not remember the exact location or date of the alleged assault but said it happened when a supervisor asked her to deliver a duffel bag to Biden on Capitol Hill .
When she met up with the then-senator in a hallway , Reade told NPR , he pinned her up against a wall and penetrated her vagina with his fingers . `` His hands went underneath my clothing and he was touching me in my private areas and without my consent , '' Reade said .
Reade first made the accusation on a podcast in March , and it has since been reported by several other news outlets , including NPR .
At the time , Reade says she told her brother , her late mother and a friend . Reade 's friend told NPR that she heard the same specific details of the alleged assault at the time , but declined to be identified . Her brother , Collin Moulton , told NPR that Reade had said Biden put his hands `` under her clothes . ''
Earlier this week , a former neighbor of Reade named Lynda LaCasse told NPR that Reade told her about the alleged assault approximately 25 years ago . `` I do remember her telling me that Joe Biden had put her up against a wall and had put his hands up her skirt and had put his fingers inside her , '' LaCasse told NPR , recalling a conversation she says took place two to three years after the alleged incident .
Reade says she never told anyone in Biden 's office about the assault , though she says she did complain about harassment . Multiple people who worked in Biden 's office at the time told NPR that they did not remember those complaints and denied Reade 's recollections about a hostile office environment .
Reade says she also filed a formal written complaint about harassment to a Senate personnel office but did not receive any follow-up . She did not have a copy of the complaint and said she could not recall the name of the office where she had filed paperwork .
In his statement Friday morning , Biden says any record of that complaint would be housed in the National Archives .
`` I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document . If there was ever any such complaint , the record will be there , '' Biden said .
Asked on MSNBC whether Biden would also be willing to ask the Archives to release any complaint about harassment from Reade or any other Senate staffer , Biden indicated he would . `` To the best of my knowledge , there have been no complaints against me , '' Biden said . `` There 's nothing for me to hide . Nothing at all . ''
But on Friday , the National Archives said in a statement to NPR , `` Any records of Senate personnel complaints from 1993 would have remained under the control of the Senate . Accordingly , inquiries related to these records should be directed to the Senate . ''
Later on Friday , Biden released a letter to Secretary of the Senate Julie Adams , asking her office to take `` whatever steps are necessary to establish the location of the records , '' adding , `` I would ask that the public release include not only a complaint if one exists , but any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation . ''
But pressed repeatedly by host Brzezinski on whether he would also authorize the University of Delaware to search its extensive archives of Biden 's Senate papers for any mention of Reade , Biden declined , saying the school 's collection does not include personnel files .
`` They 're not there , '' Biden said , saying the papers should be kept private until after he 's no longer seeking or in public office , as they could reveal `` confidential conversations , '' including with heads of state .
The agreement with the university has been that the records would be made public two years after Biden retires from office . That sort of delayed release is standard protocol for records of public officeholders .
Reade 's story has evolved from last year , when she came forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate touching , joining other women coming forward with such complaints as Biden prepared to launch his campaign . Several of them , though , said the behavior was not sexual in nature . Reade 's allegation is the first public allegation of sexual assault made against Biden .
While the Biden campaign had unequivocally denied Reade 's allegation through a statement from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield , Biden himself had not addressed it until now , more than a month after Reade first made the allegation in a public forum .
`` As a Presidential candidate , I 'm accountable to the American people . We have lived long enough with a President who does n't think he is accountable to anyone , and takes responsibility for nothing . That 's not me . I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations , even when they are uncomfortable . People need to hear the truth , '' Biden said in his statement .
In the weeks before he addressed the charge himself , several prominent Democrats had to walk a fine line of defending Biden , while also addressing the rallying cry of the # MeToo Movement to `` believe women '' who come forward with serious allegations against prominent men .
`` Here 's the thing : I have complete respect for the whole # MeToo Movement . I have four daughters , one son , and there is a lot of excitement around the idea that women will be heard and be listened to , '' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said Thursday when asked about the allegation . `` There is also due process . And the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden – there have been statements from his campaign , or not his campaign but his former employees who ran his offices and the rest , that there was never any record of this . There was never any record and that nobody ever came forward , or that nobody ever came forward to say something about it apart from the principal involved . ''
President Trump , who has been accused by numerous women of various instances of sexual assault and harassment , weighed in on the allegation for the first time on Thursday . `` I think he should respond . It could be false accusations . I know all about false accusations , I 've been falsely charged numerous times , '' Trump told reporters at the White House .","'This Never Happened,' Biden Says Of 1990s Sexual Assault Allegation

At the time, Reade says she told her brother, her late mother and a friend. Reade's friend told NPR that she heard the same specific details of the alleged assault at the time, but declined to be identified. Her brother, Collin Moulton, told NPR that Reade had said Biden put his hands ""under her clothes.""

Earlier this week, a former neighbor of Reade named Lynda LaCasse told NPR that Reade told her about the alleged assault approximately 25 years ago. ""I do remember her telling me that Joe Biden had put her up against a wall and had put his hands up her skirt and had put his fingers inside her,"" LaCasse told NPR, recalling a conversation she says took place two to three years after the alleged incident.

Reade says she never told anyone in Biden's office about the assault, though she says she did complain about harassment. Multiple people who worked in Biden's office at the time told NPR that they did not remember those complaints and denied Reade's recollections about a hostile office environment.

Records searches

Reade says she also filed a formal written complaint about harassment to a Senate personnel office but did not receive any follow-up. She did not have a copy of the complaint and said she could not recall the name of the office where she had filed paperwork.

In his statement Friday morning, Biden says any record of that complaint would be housed in the National Archives.

""I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there,"" Biden said.

Asked on MSNBC whether Biden would also be willing to ask the Archives to release any complaint about harassment from Reade or any other Senate staffer, Biden indicated he would. ""To the best of my knowledge, there have been no complaints against me,"" Biden said. ""There's nothing for me to hide. Nothing at all.""

But on Friday, the National Archives said in a statement to NPR, ""Any records of Senate personnel complaints from 1993 would have remained under the control of the Senate. Accordingly, inquiries related to these records should be directed to the Senate.""

Later on Friday, Biden released a letter to Secretary of the Senate Julie Adams, asking her office to take ""whatever steps are necessary to establish the location of the records,"" adding, ""I would ask that the public release include not only a complaint if one exists, but any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation.""

But pressed repeatedly by host Brzezinski on whether he would also authorize the University of Delaware to search its extensive archives of Biden's Senate papers for any mention of Reade, Biden declined, saying the school's collection does not include personnel files.

""They're not there,"" Biden said, saying the papers should be kept private until after he's no longer seeking or in public office, as they could reveal ""confidential conversations,"" including with heads of state.

The agreement with the university has been that the records would be made public two years after Biden retires from office. That sort of delayed release is standard protocol for records of public officeholders.

""I'm accountable to the American people""

Reade's story has evolved from last year, when she came forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate touching, joining other women coming forward with such complaints as Biden prepared to launch his campaign. Several of them, though, said the behavior was not sexual in nature. Reade's allegation is the first public allegation of sexual assault made against Biden.

While the Biden campaign had unequivocally denied Reade's allegation through a statement from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, Biden himself had not addressed it until now, more than a month after Reade first made the allegation in a public forum.

""As a Presidential candidate, I'm accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn't think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That's not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth,"" Biden said in his statement.

In the weeks before he addressed the charge himself, several prominent Democrats had to walk a fine line of defending Biden, while also addressing the rallying cry of the #MeToo Movement to ""believe women"" who come forward with serious allegations against prominent men.

""Here's the thing: I have complete respect for the whole #MeToo Movement. I have four daughters, one son, and there is a lot of excitement around the idea that women will be heard and be listened to,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday when asked about the allegation. ""There is also due process. And the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden – there have been statements from his campaign, or not his campaign but his former employees who ran his offices and the rest, that there was never any record of this. There was never any record and that nobody ever came forward, or that nobody ever came forward to say something about it apart from the principal involved.""

President Trump, who has been accused by numerous women of various instances of sexual assault and harassment, weighed in on the allegation for the first time on Thursday. ""I think he should respond. It could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations, I've been falsely charged numerous times,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.",www.npr.org,center,tfwxl4xgVbic17wY

Film mogul Harvey Weinstein has reached a tentative $25m (£19m) settlement with dozens of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, lawyers have said.

About 30 actresses and ex-employees would share the payout in the deal.

However, it still needs signing off by all parties, Mr Weinstein's lawyers have not commented and some say the deal will punish those holding out.

Mr Weinstein faces a separate criminal trial next month on rape and sexual assault charges, which he denies.

The Hollywood producer could face life in jail if convicted.

On Wednesday, Mr Weinstein's bail sum was raised from $1m to $5m for the alleged mishandling of an electronic ankle monitor.

He attended the court hearing in New York using a walking frame. His lawyers said he was undergoing surgery on Thursday for injuries suffered in a car accident in August.

What is in the agreement?

It is important to stress it is still not final. Details of the deal were initially carried in the New York Times, but lawyers have confirmed most of them with other US media outlets.

The newspaper said the agreement had obtained preliminary approval from most of the parties involved.

The main elements appear to be:

The plaintiffs in the case would share in the payout, as could others who join the suit

It is a global deal that would end almost all related civil lawsuits against Mr Weinstein and his previous employer

Mr Weinstein would not pay personally, the sum would come from insurance firms representing the Weinstein Company

Mr Weinstein would not admit wrongdoing

Court approval would be required

The $25m is part of a larger $47m package intended to close the Weinstein Company's liabilities, including legal fees

Lawyers for Mr Weinstein and The Weinstein Company contacted by the New York Times and other media outlets have declined to comment.

A group lawsuit had been brought by dozens of women who accuse Mr Weinstein of sexual harassment and abuse, though high-profile figures who have also made allegations, such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, are not part of the action.

What has the reaction been?

It has certainly been mixed.

Genie Harrison, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, told the New York Times: ""I don't think there's a markedly better deal to be made.""

She said other alleged victims who hold out could end up with nothing, and that they should ""come forward and be able to get the best level of compensation we were able to get"".

One plaintiff backing the deal, Louisette Geiss, told Associated Press (AP) news agency: ""This settlement will ensure that all survivors have the chance for recovery and can move forward without Harvey's damaging lock on their careers.""

He denies the charges.

He also pleaded not guilty in August to two additional charges of predatory sexual assault over an alleged rape in 1993, although these cannot be prosecuted because of time limits.

But his favor has dipped even further amid new allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that he dumped into the news cycle Sunday night .
“ On the heels of the New Yorker story , Michael Avenatti , the attorney for Stormy Daniels , jumped into the fray with some utterly uncorroborated allegations , ” wrote Ryan Grim in an newsletter emailed to readers . He ’ s the Washington Bureau Chief for The Intercept and formerly an editor at the left-leaning Huffington Post. ” I would suggest ignoring him until he comes forward with real evidence , which he promises is coming in the next few days . ”
But as Glenn Close ‘ s psychotic character tells her one-time lover Michael Douglass in Fatal Attraction , “ I ’ m not going to be ignored . ”
Who knows ? Maybe…just maybe this time Avenatti has a coherent claim ?
Avenatti , a Democrat who insists he may put his hat in the ring for the White House in 2020 , released a provocative tweet early Sunday evening .
“ I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge , ” he wrote . “ We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify . The nomination must be withdrawn . ”
Several publications took him seriously enough to cover a story about his claims , including The New York Post and The Hill . But the pieces are carefully worded to say “ He says… ” and “ He claims. ” The publication reported that Avenatti ’ s so-called bombshell came “ minutes ” before a bigger story popped in The New Yorker by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow . The article introduced a new woman to the judge ’ s scandalous picture — a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh ’ s who says he put his penis in her face during a drinking game 35 years ago .
Avenatti exchanged emails with the Senate Judiciary Committee . He says he has evidence of debauchery back in the 80s in which Kavanaugh participated in parties where women were gang raped .
“ Brett Kavanaugh must also be asked about this entry in his yearbook : ‘ FFFFFFFourth of July. ’ We believe that this stands for : Find them , French them , Feel them , Finger them , F * ck them , Forget them , ” he wrote . “ As well as the term ‘ Devil ’ s Triangle. ’ Perhaps Sen.

Avenatti is set to appear on CNN ’ s “ Cuomo Prime Time ” Monday night .","Michael Avenatti, the TV-friendly attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, has never exactly enjoyed popularity among political journalists. But his favor has dipped even further amid new allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that he dumped into the news cycle Sunday night.

Even liberal journalists aren’t buying what he’s selling.

“On the heels of the New Yorker story, Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Stormy Daniels, jumped into the fray with some utterly uncorroborated allegations,” wrote Ryan Grim in an newsletter emailed to readers. He’s the Washington Bureau Chief for The Intercept and formerly an editor at the left-leaning Huffington Post.”I would suggest ignoring him until he comes forward with real evidence, which he promises is coming in the next few days.”

But as Glenn Close‘s psychotic character tells her one-time lover Michael Douglass in Fatal Attraction, “I’m not going to be ignored.”

Who knows? Maybe…just maybe this time Avenatti has a coherent claim?

Avenatti, a Democrat who insists he may put his hat in the ring for the White House in 2020, released a provocative tweet early Sunday evening.

“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge,” he wrote. “We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify. The nomination must be withdrawn.”

Several publications took him seriously enough to cover a story about his claims, including The New York Post and The Hill. But the pieces are carefully worded to say “He says…” and “He claims.” The publication reported that Avenatti’s so-called bombshell came “minutes” before a bigger story popped in The New Yorker by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow. The article introduced a new woman to the judge’s scandalous picture — a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s who says he put his penis in her face during a drinking game 35 years ago.

Avenatti exchanged emails with the Senate Judiciary Committee. He says he has evidence of debauchery back in the 80s in which Kavanaugh participated in parties where women were gang raped.

He also tweeted this:

“Brett Kavanaugh must also be asked about this entry in his yearbook: ‘FFFFFFFourth of July.’ We believe that this stands for: Find them, French them, Feel them, Finger them, F*ck them, Forget them,” he wrote. “As well as the term ‘Devil’s Triangle.’ Perhaps Sen. Grassley can ask him. #Basta.”

But even Jeet Heer, a staff writer for The New Republic, a liberal mag, has serious doubts about Avenatti’s allegations.

“I’d be really, really cautious about the Avenatti claims,” Heer tweeted just before 10 p.m. Sunday night.

Can we talk?

I mean really talk.

For the record, sexual assault is not permissible under any circumstances. It doesn’t matter if it’s men groping other men, men taking advantage of women, or whether the offender is powerful, a peer, or complete stranger. If it isn’t consensual, it’s off limits.

On the other hand, consider this: You don’t leave your front door wide open and say, “Why do I have to change when it’s the thief’s behavior that’s the problem!” You don’t walk down a dark alley on the bad side of town alone, leave your keys in the ignition, or taunt street gang members.

I’m not saying that if you do you deserve to be harassed or assaulted. No, far from it. But neither do I accept the outlook that women are dependent on the law and others to protect them. There are precautions women can and should take. And the more we deny women the opportunity to take control before an incident can occur, the less empowered they feel.

Let me explain.

I am a woman. I rose up through the ranks in Silicon Valley during the 1980s and 90s to become one of only 3 women CEOs in technology at that time. Surrounded by male executives, engineers, scientists, and investors, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind as to whether I experienced my share of offensive advances, offers, and suggestions.

But here is where I part company with my sisters who are calling for the heads of Weinstein, Franken, Lauer, Rose, Conyers, Keillor, Moore, and others. I took as many measures as I could to avoid situations where I could be vulnerable. Obviously, I wasn’t successful at eliminating all harassment. But as sure as I run my own business today, I’m confident I avoided many more incidents than I fell victim to.

And while I’m certain to hear from folks who insist I’m making women responsible for the sexual misconduct which is now coming to light, for those interested in taking measures to head off harassment, these are some of the workarounds I found helpful:

6. Working late is often necessary, but these days there is very little that cannot be done at home. If you do need to stay late find a friend who also has some catching up to do. The buddy system works.

There are things women can and should do.

sexual_misconduct,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/dec/26/congress-metoo-sexual-harassment-problems-likely-h/,'Betraying women': Congress' #MeToo problems likely to hit Democrats harder,2019-12-26,Alex Swoyer,"The # MeToo campaign against workplace sexual harassment has snared eight Capitol Hill lawmakers and nearly sank the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice in the two years since the movement flourished , tarnishing the reputations of Democrats and Republicans alike .
The lawmakers who were disgraced or run out of office consisted of five Democrats and three Republicans in the short time since # MeToo caught fire in October 2017 with an expose that toppled Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein .
“ This is not as much of a political problem as it is a sinful nature of mankind problem , and unfortunately this behavior isn ’ t limited to one party or the other , but I do expect people of my ilk to demand justice , ” said Penny Nance , president of Concerned Women for America .
Seeing trouble among their ranks , House Democrats spearheaded changes to legislation protecting their staff on Capitol Hill .
Congress unanimously approved new rules last December to tamp down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill . Under the changes , investigations are to be sped up and lawmakers must reimburse the government for any harassment settlements or court awards paid out because of their actions . They also provide for annual reports on settlements .
The rules are binding on the House and the Senate .
Former Rep. Katie Hill , California Democrat , had championed women ’ s issues , including protesting Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , who was accused of sexual misconduct dating back more than three decades . Investigations by lawmakers and the FBI failed to substantiate the allegations .
Eventually , Ms. Hill ended up getting tarnished herself by the # MeToo movement . She faced allegations of an affair with members of her staff , including engaging in a threesome with a female campaign employee and her ex-husband .
The lawmaker ’ s fall was covered for weeks in the media , including the publishing of nude photos that allegedly were released by her former spouse .
“ Accusations against Democratic Rep. Katie Hill — constituting a threesome endeavor — on the flamboyance measure tend to not make one think of Republicans , ” said Richard Vatz , a rhetoric and communication professor at Towson University . “ Accusations against Brett Kavanaugh , even if true , involve no behavior past his high school youth , which period has been marked for decades as revealing abstemious behavior toward women . ”
In her first interview since leaving office , Ms. Hill told Playboy she hasn ’ t ruled out running for office again .
“ Every single bit of my dirty laundry will be out there — the most private things I didn ’ t ever think would come out . I ’ ll be quite literally fully exposed to the voters . So judge me for what I ’ ve got , ” she said .
The late Rep. John Conyers , Michigan Democrat , was another notable lawmaker with more than five decades in Congress who was swept out of office with the # MeToo movement in 2017 when he faced a House Ethics Committee investigation after several former staffers accused him of sexual harassment .
Around the same time Mr. Conyers resigned , Sen. Al Franken , Minnesota Democrat , was accused of having touched women inappropriately and kissed them , leading to his resignation in early 2018 .

( * Correction : Rep. Ruben Kihuen ’ s state was listed incorrectly in a previous version of the story . He is a Nevada Democrat . )","The #MeToo campaign against workplace sexual harassment has snared eight Capitol Hill lawmakers and nearly sank the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice in the two years since the movement flourished, tarnishing the reputations of Democrats and Republicans alike.

The lawmakers who were disgraced or run out of office consisted of five Democrats and three Republicans in the short time since #MeToo caught fire in October 2017 with an expose that toppled Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

“This is not as much of a political problem as it is a sinful nature of mankind problem, and unfortunately this behavior isn’t limited to one party or the other, but I do expect people of my ilk to demand justice,” said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America.

Seeing trouble among their ranks, House Democrats spearheaded changes to legislation protecting their staff on Capitol Hill.

Congress unanimously approved new rules last December to tamp down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. Under the changes, investigations are to be sped up and lawmakers must reimburse the government for any harassment settlements or court awards paid out because of their actions. They also provide for annual reports on settlements.

The rules are binding on the House and the Senate.

Former Rep. Katie Hill, California Democrat, had championed women’s issues, including protesting Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination, who was accused of sexual misconduct dating back more than three decades. Investigations by lawmakers and the FBI failed to substantiate the allegations.

Eventually, Ms. Hill ended up getting tarnished herself by the #MeToo movement. She faced allegations of an affair with members of her staff, including engaging in a threesome with a female campaign employee and her ex-husband.

The lawmaker’s fall was covered for weeks in the media, including the publishing of nude photos that allegedly were released by her former spouse.

“Accusations against Democratic Rep. Katie Hill — constituting a threesome endeavor — on the flamboyance measure tend to not make one think of Republicans,” said Richard Vatz, a rhetoric and communication professor at Towson University. “Accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, even if true, involve no behavior past his high school youth, which period has been marked for decades as revealing abstemious behavior toward women.”

In her first interview since leaving office, Ms. Hill told Playboy she hasn’t ruled out running for office again.

“Every single bit of my dirty laundry will be out there — the most private things I didn’t ever think would come out. I’ll be quite literally fully exposed to the voters. So judge me for what I’ve got,” she said.

The late Rep. John Conyers, Michigan Democrat, was another notable lawmaker with more than five decades in Congress who was swept out of office with the #MeToo movement in 2017 when he faced a House Ethics Committee investigation after several former staffers accused him of sexual harassment.

Around the same time Mr. Conyers resigned, Sen. Al Franken, Minnesota Democrat, was accused of having touched women inappropriately and kissed them, leading to his resignation in early 2018.

And Rep. Ruben Kihuen, Nevada* Democrat, decided not to seek reelection in late 2017 after facing a nine-month probe of whether he harassed women. Additionally, Rep. Bobby Scott, Virginia Democrat, denied ever having harassed one of his staffers back in 2013 after the accusation surfaced. He remains in office.

Republicans got caught up in the #MeToo wave, too.

Former Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona resigned in late 2017 after it was revealed he had offered a female employee millions of dollars to serve as a surrogate.

Former Rep. Blake Farenthold, Texas Republican, resigned in 2018 after it was revealed he had used $84,000 from the Treasury fund to settle a lawsuit brought by his female communications director in 2014.

Rep. Patrick Meehan, Pennsylvania Republican, was forced into retirement last year after a House Ethics Committee probe revealed he had used taxpayer funds to settle a sexual misconduct lawsuit brought by one of his aides.

Mr. Vatz said there is no significant difference between the number of Republicans and Democrats caught up in the #MeToo campaign, but he said Democrats could be more angered when colleagues in their party face sexual misconduct accusations since they purport to be the party defending women’s issues.

“There is possibly some resentment of Democrats by Democrats that they are betraying women, in that Democrats portray themselves as more sympathetic and empathetic to females,” Mr. Vatz said.

While all of these politicians were outed for their conduct, taxpayers also learned that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been used to settle sexual harassment and other workplace misconduct claims against Congress members over the past two decades.

The details about which lawmakers have reached into the fund were not made public, only the amount of each claim.

Concerned Women for America’s Ms. Nance said the names should be made public. She faulted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, for not disclosing the identities of the members who have had to settle these accusations with taxpayer funds.

sexual_misconduct,ThinkProgress,0,https://thinkprogress.org/jim-jordan-seventh-accuser-798ef95906fc/,The list of Jim Jordan accusers keeps growing,,,"Over the weekend , a seventh former wrestler at Ohio State University came forward and accused Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) of doing nothing in the face of the largest sexual abuse scandal in U.S. sports history .
For weeks , Jordan has insisted that , while he was an assistant coach for the Buckeyes wrestling team in the 80 ’ s and 90 ’ s , he was completely unaware that team trainer Richard Strauss was systematically abusing hundreds of OSU athletes .
Three former wrestlers told NBC News that Jordan had to have known about the allegations , and did nothing to stop the abuse . Since then , four more former teammates have corroborated those accounts , saying there was simply no way Jordan didn ’ t know what was going on .
The seventh wrestler came forward on Friday in an interview with the Washington Post .
“ Jordan definitely knew that these things were happening — yes , most definitely , ” said David Range , who wrestled for Ohio State in the late 1980s . “ It was there . He knew about it because it was an everyday occurrence . ”
Nobody has yet accused Jordan from engaging in any abusive behavior himself , but several of his former athletes — including some who considered Jordan a friend — have expressed their resentment that the congressman has denied even knowing about the abuse .
In a Politico report last week , other former Ohio State personnel described the wrestling team as a “ cesspool of deviancy ” during the period in which Jordan served as an assistant coach . Even Jordan ’ s supporters have acknowledged that the toxic culture was widespread and well-known . “ It was pretty common knowledge it was going on , yes , ” said Rob Archer , a Buckeyes wrestler in the early 90 ’ s who came to Jordan ’ s defense .
Jordan himself acknowledged as much during an interview on Fox News Friday evening , seemingly contradicting his earlier pleas of ignorance when he told host Brett Baier “ conversations in a locker room are a lot different than allegations of abuse . ”

Part of the hangup appears to be over semantics . In the 1980s , exactly what constituted sexual abuse — as opposed to merely “ inappropriate ” or “ creepy ” behavior — was even less understood than it is today . Jordan has insisted no wrestler ever came to him with a story of “ sexual abuse. ” But Dunyasha Yetts — one of the first wrestlers to come forward , who says he asked Jordan to accompany him to Strauss ’ s office because he feared he would be groped — says it ’ s a difference without a distinction .

His fellow far-right extremists in Congress were urging Jordan to seek a leadership position in the Republican caucus once retiring Rep.

Joe Biden has pledged to be ""more mindful"" about physical contact with women, hoping to draw a line under a controversy that has clouded his expected White House bid.

The former US vice-president posted a video on Twitter saying he will in future respect personal space.

Mr Biden stressed he has only ever intended to build a ""human connection"", rather than make anyone uncomfortable.

He has not yet announced whether he will join the 2020 Democratic field.

""Social norms are changing, I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying,"" Mr Biden, 76, said in a tweet accompanying the video, which looked like it had been recorded on a mobile phone.

In the clip, Mr Biden acknowledged being hands-on with constituents throughout his long career in politics.

""It's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and I'm listening,"" he said.

But Mr Biden acknowledged his past behaviour may not meet contemporary standards.

Rowling finally spoke in defense of Johnny Depp , who will play the titular evil wizard in the 2018 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald .
Depp has been accused of domestic abuse , with a great deal of credible evidence provided . And Rowling has long been a supporter of charities that help victims of domestic abuse , and may be a survivor herself . Yet Depp plays a major role in the new Harry Potter sequel franchise , based on Rowling ’ s books — and Rowling says that ’ s with her blessing .
“ I accept that there will be those who are not satisfied with our choice of actor , ” Rowling wrote in a statement on her website . “ However , conscience isn ’ t governable by committee . Within the fictional world and outside it , we all have to do what we believe to be the right thing . ”
And so , she declares , “ based on our understanding of the circumstances , ” Rowling and her fellow filmmakers are “ genuinely happy ” with Depp ’ s casting .
Rowling is not specific about what her “ understanding of the circumstances ” is — presumably because of legal reasons — but the implication here is that she believes Depp did not abuse his ex-wife Amber Heard , which by extension implies that Heard was lying when she said he did .
Fair enough ; Rowling is a major force , and she probably does know something about the situation that the rest of us don ’ t . But without access to that knowledge , all we can read into Rowling ’ s statement is the implication that Heard lied when she accused Depp of repeatedly hitting and kicking her . That the bruises on her face when she reported him to the police were fake , that the pictures of broken glass and smashed bottles were staged , that the video she took of him screaming at her was misleadingly edited , that the doctor ’ s report showing that Depp cut off the tip of his finger was unrelated , and that the years of text messages documenting his abuse were all part of a cunning plot to destroy an innocent man . ( Heard , incidentally , donated her divorce settlement to charity . )
For a woman who has done as much work with victims of domestic violence as Rowling has , this is a puzzling position to take . But it ’ s part of a larger trend that ’ s begun to emerge over the course of the great reckoning of powerful men accused of mistreating women : Over and over again , people and institutions that ostensibly support the # MeToo and “ believe women ” movements have found caveats in their opinions when the accused man is someone who is on their team .
Multiple Democrats , including Keith Olbermann and bloggers at the Daily Kos , invent conspiracy theories to defend Al Franken . Celebrity feminist Lena Dunham makes a public statement declaring that an accusation of rape against one of the staff writers for her show Girls must be “ one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year , ” citing her “ insider knowledge. ” And J.K. Rowling , a longtime advocate for survivors of domestic abuse , tells the world that she is sure this accused abuser is just fine .
This trend demonstrates the power of tribalism , how our identification as part of a “ team ” can overrule even values that appear to be deeply held . And it shows how insidiously violence against women is baked into our culture , so that even those who seem to want to fight against it feel compelled to look the other way once it stares them directly in the face .
False accusations are rare . Most progressives know that . But some are willing to invoke them anyway .
To be clear , I ’ m not trying to suggest that J.K Rowling is secretly a hater of women and a supporter of those who batter women . I ’ m certain that she genuinely wants to help survivors of domestic abuse , and that her charity work comes from a place of compassion . I also think that Lena Dunham is honestly a feminist who does genuinely want to help rape survivors , and that many of the Democrats who suggested that Franken was the victim of a conspiracy theory really do want to put their political power to work helping women rather than those who hurt them .
But that does not change the fact that for all of these people , when push came to shove , the desire to protect “ their team ” overwhelmed a probably deeply held belief that it is important to support and believe women . And in protecting “ their team , ” these people have ended up playing into one of the biggest myths of rape culture : the false report .
“ Rape is incredibly common ( about one in five women experience sexual assault ) , and false reports are rare ( 2 to 8 percent ) , ” Emily Crockett for ███ wrote last year . “ So if a woman comes forward about being assaulted , Occam 's razor suggests she 's probably telling the truth. ” Similar numbers hold for domestic violence : One in three women experience intimate partner violence throughout their lives , and the rate of false reporting is low .
Moreover , there are few good reasons for a woman to come forward with a false accusation against a powerful , well-connected man : The most likely outcome is that he will skate through the ensuing fallout with no permanent damage , while her name will be dragged through the mud .
Presumably , an advocate for domestic violence survivors like J.K. Rowling has some awareness of these facts and figures . Dunham , who cited them in her statement , absolutely does . Olbermann , who has a history of spinning conspiracy theories around assault victims , probably doesn ’ t believe them if he does know them — but if those who associate themselves with the Democratic Party truly want it to be seen as the party of women , Olbermann and other liberals have a responsibility to internalize those figures .
And yet all of these people and institutions made the same basic argument : She is probably lying … for some reason . Leeann Tweeden is probably lying about Al Franken because she is one of “ the ratfucking Republican operatives [ who ] try to weaponize the MeToo movement and use liberals ’ decency against us. ” Aurora Perrineau is probably lying about Girls writer Murray Miller , based on “ our insider knowledge of Murray 's situation. ” Heard , who seemed to go out of her way to discredit the idea that she would get anything out of a false accusation , is probably lying about Depp , “ based on our understanding of the circumstances . ”
Is it within the realm of possibility that Heard is lying ? Sure . Theoretically she could be , as Dunham suggested of Perrineau , within that small percentage of false accusers . But it ’ s statistically highly unlikely . To believe Depp ’ s claims unquestioningly , you have to overlook a lot of math — and that ’ s even before the evidence Heard provided comes into play .
There ’ s no reason that we know of for Rowling to think that Heard is lying , beyond the fact that Heard accused someone who is on Rowling ’ s “ team ” — and that was enough to turn her from a victim of domestic violence whom Rowling could support into an opponent trying to destroy the team . So if the team was to be preserved , Heard had to be lying , evidence and statistics be damned .
If people and institutions that know how rare false accusations are can make such claims when it suits their interests , it does not bode well for the rest of the world . This is how rape culture survives . This is how violence against women lurks in the shadows . This is how predators flourish .

Biden’s habitual embraces can be inappropriate without being sexual harassment; his conduct can be a demerit without being disqualifying.”

Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post

A longtime aide and former press secretary of the Vice President writes, “From 2006 to 2011, I worked closely with Joe Biden on both his Senate and White House staff. I traveled the country and the world with him, certainly logging more miles and sometimes feeling as if I spent more time with him than I did with my own family. Wherever he was during those years, be it Wilmington or Baghdad, I wasn’t far away. I saw him at his best and his worst, in quiet moments and on the world’s largest stages. Through it all, in big ways and in the small ways that sometimes matter even more, he was, is and always has been a champion for women and equality.”

Elizabeth E. Alexander, USA Today

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

This week, my NPR Illinois and ProPublica colleagues reported on a lawsuit filed by two former University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students and a professor at another college against former Illinois professor Gary Gang Xu, alleging he assaulted, bullied and raped multiple students — and specifically targeted female Chinese students.

During the past decade, the flagship campus at Urbana-Champaign has become a destination for students from China and has enrolled more Chinese undergraduates during some years than any university in the U.S. There are 569 freshmen from China this year, about 7.4% of the class, according to university data released this week. Overall, there are 5,825 U. of I. students from China, including more than 3,000 undergraduates.

In 2006, fewer than 20 freshmen came from China.

Five years ago, while a reporter at the Chicago Tribune, I traveled to China to write about this phenomenon. It was the first year that admissions officials held freshman orientation sessions in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, a reflection of the growing student population and the need to help them prepare for college life in the U.S.

I spoke with Xu while reporting that series. He was a university expert on the subject. A native of Nanjing, China, he started teaching at the university in the early 2000s. He explained that the connection between the university and China dates to the early 1900s, when then-university President Edmund James encouraged Chinese students to study there. James wrote in a journal article that educating Chinese students would benefit the U.S. and help secure relations between the two countries.

James also persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to create a scholarship program, with money China paid to the U.S. at the end of the Boxer Rebellion in 1901, to support Chinese students’ studies here.

So when Chinese students began studying abroad in the 1980s, many picked Illinois.

“Chinese college students heard these stories, and those historical roots opened the door at the right time for us. When the floodgate was lifted, students were thinking of U. of I. as a nice destination because of all of these stories,” Xu told me in 2014.

Read More Assaults, Bullying, Rape: A Lawsuit Against One Professor Claims a University Didn’t Stop Him Former University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign professor Gary Gang Xu assaulted and threatened students while university officials downplayed complaints, a lawsuit says.

At the time, he was a tenured professor and the head of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures. The lawsuit alleges that, at the same time, Xu was in an abusive relationship with an undergraduate student from China, one of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. She was 19 and he was 45 when they met, according to the lawsuit, and he allegedly sexually assaulted her and coerced her to have an abortion. He allegedly threatened to send her back to China if she did not drop reports she made to the university about his conduct. (I knew nothing about these claims when I spoke with Xu).

In March 2018, Xu denied sexual assault claims, as reported in the student newspaper. He resigned from the university last year, two years after a university investigation found he committed misconduct. He was on paid leave for more than two years — from Jan. 1, 2016, to Aug. 15, 2018 — and received $10,000 as part of his resignation agreement. His salary had been $85,446.

The university told NPR Illinois and ProPublica reporters in a statement: “We are aware of the filing and are reviewing it. We cannot comment on any of its contents at this time.”

Xu had a lot to say when I spoke with him five years ago about how the influx of Chinese students has changed the campus, the communities of Urbana and Champaign, and the students.

Ghislaine Maxwell, the alleged child sex trafficker and abuser in league with Epstein, was finally arrested Thursday morning.

Her guilt, in the court of public opinion, isn’t in question.

The only question is: Will the federal government keep Maxwell alive to stand trial?

There’s good reason conspiracy theories still swirl around Epstein’s suicide, nearly one year ago, in a downtown federal prison — a prison, by the way, that safely housed Bernie Madoff, the 1993 World Trade Center bomber, El Chapo and a terrorist who told the New York Times it was tougher than Guantanamo Bay — and he would know, because he’d been held in both.

It stands to reason that the federal government should be able to contain a socialite.

At the time of his death, Epstein was likely the most high-value prisoner in federal custody. He had ties to incredibly powerful men who had everything to lose if they were exposed. He was that most vile of criminals, a pedophile, a child molester, a rapist and a sex trafficker.

Maxwell is the last chance these victims have at justice. Epstein’s suicide was yet another brutal victimization. The federal government — if only out of its own self-interest — cannot let a prison suicide (or “suicide,” depending on what you believe) happen again.

Maxwell must be treated as she is: as high-value as Epstein, as dangerous and sneaky, kept under the strictest 24/7 suicide watch.

Here’s a detail that should make prosecutors and prison guards nervous: In the recent Netflix documentary “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,” a survivor stands outside Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse and points to pockmarks in the edifice.

Such pockmarks, she says, were all over the interior. The entire house — every room, every bed, every bathroom, shower and toilet — was rigged with cameras and audio. Epstein kept a secret room full of monitors and watched his guests in real time. He blackmailed the powerful men who would visit and use his girls.

If Maxwell dies in custody, the federal government will take a hit from which it may never recover.

Consider the testimony of survivors in the same documentary.

“Tears of joy were streaming down my face,” Virginia Roberts Giuffre said upon hearing of Epstein’s arrest.

“Oh my God,” said Michelle Licata. “Finally. He is going to pay for everything he has done.”

One survivor warned the feds that Epstein had a way of evading justice. “I told them that they needed to look out for their victims,” she said. “I told them that if they were going to do this thing, they needed to really do it.”

His death hit these survivors that much harder because they had been given hope. They had been heard, seen, and believed. They were told they would have their day in court.

Those other powerful men with ties to Epstein, Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton among them, would not impede a federal trial — and in fact, Epstein’s trial would mean more conspirators and participants would fall.

“They’re going to start digging into his life,” said Licata, “and start pulling out this spider web of people that were related to it.”

No question Ghislaine Maxwell is Person of Interest Number One.

Maxwell’s favorite game, Giuffre said, was to place a young girl in front of a powerful older man and say: “How old do you think she is?”

From now on, every time we see her image, please let it be her mug shot — not that disgusting photo of Maxwell, beaming alongside Epstein, his arm oh-so-casually slung around her, his face smugly tilted upward, as if to indicate their complicity, amorality, self-regard and immunity from justice.

We’ve seen the fall of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, men who thought they were too powerful to ever see the inside of a prison cell.

Epstein took the coward’s way out.

sexual_misconduct,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/29/sexual-allegations-against-joe-biden-corroborators/,The sexual allegations against Joe Biden: The corroborators,2020-04-29,Glenn Kessler,"That ’ s what we wrote back in 2016 , when we first put together a list of the allegations of sexual misconduct against former president Bill Clinton and then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential campaign . We later expanded the list for Trump in 2017 , eventually reaching a total of 16 women , after more allegations emerged . ( See the video below . )
As we noted , contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chances that a person is making up a story for political purposes . In the case of sexual allegations , such accounts can help bolster the credibility of the “ she said ” side of the equation . Often , a sexual assault will happen behind closed doors . The contemporary corroborators can explain what they heard at the time and whether the story being told now is consistent with how the story was told years earlier . This does not necessarily mean the allegation is true , but it does give a journalistic organization more confidence to report on the allegation .
Now , a serious allegation of sexual misconduct has emerged against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , former vice president Joe Biden . A number of women have said Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection , but this claim goes further and says a sexual assault took place .
The Biden campaign has issued a statement from deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield : “ Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press . What is clear about this claim : It is untrue . This absolutely did not happen. ” On May 1 , Biden issued a statement in his own name -- the allegations “ aren ’ t true . This never happened ” -- and then repeated the denial in an interview on MSNBC ’ s “ Morning Joe : “ `` It never , never happened . ”
Allegations of sexual misconduct concerning politicians often emerge piecemeal , with different news organizations running their own investigations . The ███ ran a lengthy article on the Biden allegation on April 12 , but more details have emerged since then .
As a reader service , here are the details of the allegation and the corroborating evidence that so far has emerged , following the same format as we did with the claims concerning Trump and Clinton . We will continue to update this article as warranted .
Allegation : In 1993 , when she was a 29-year-old staff assistant in Biden ’ s Senate office , Biden pinned her against a wall , reached under her skirt and pushed his fingers inside her . When she resisted , Biden appeared annoyed and said , “ Come on , man , I heard you liked me. ” She said that after telling her supervisors in the office that she had been sexually harassed by Biden , supervisors ostracized her and she was eventually told to find another job . Several news organizations , including The Post , had interviewed Reade in 2019 , and she had said then only that he made her uncomfortable by touching her neck and shoulders . Reade says she was afraid to talk about the incident in greater detail at the time .
Lynda LaCasse , Reade ’ s neighbor in the mid-1990s . “ I remember her saying , here was this person [ Biden ] that she was working for and she idolized him , ” LaCasse told Business Insider . “ And he kind of put her up against a wall . And he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her . She felt like she was assaulted , and she really didn ’ t feel there was anything she could do. ” LaCasse , who described herself as a strong Democrat and a Biden supporter , lived next door to Reade in 1995 and 1996 in an apartment complex in Morro Bay , Calif. She said Reade mentioned the alleged assault during a late-night chat . “ She was crying , ” she said . “ She was upset . ”
Lorraine Sanchez , who worked with Reade in the office of California state Sen. Jack O ’ Connell from 1994 to 1996 . Reade said “ she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC , ” Sanchez told Business Insider , “ and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors , she was let go , fired. ” Sanchez did not recall if Reade mentioned Biden or whether she detailed the type of harassment that allegedly took place . “ What I do remember is reassuring her that nothing like that would ever happen to her here in our office , that she was in a safe place , free from any sexual harassment , ” Sanchez said .
Collin Moulton , Reade ’ s brother . He originally told The Post that Reade had told him in 1993 that Biden had behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders . “ A few days after that interview , Moulton sent [ a ] text saying he wanted to clarify his remarks , ” The Post reported . “ He wrote that he recalled Reade telling him in the early 1990s that Biden had cornered her and put his hands under her clothes . ”
Jeanette Altimus , Reade ’ s mother . Reade has told interviewers she confided in her mother at time of the alleged assault . Her mother died in 2016 . But Reade had recalled that her mother had called CNN ’ s “ Larry King Live ” and anonymously described trouble her daughter had had with a senator . The Intercept unearthed the 1993 video clip , in which an unnamed woman from San Luis Obispo , Calif. , told King that her daughter just left Washington , “ after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him. ” The caller did not provide further details . Reade told the Intercept the voice on the call was her mother ’ s . Her mother at the time lived in San Luis Obispo County .
Unnamed friends . Some people were quoted anonymously as supportive of Reade ’ s recollection and obviously may overlap . The ███ quoted “ a friend , a former intern for another lawmaker , ” as corroborating Reade ’ s account of their conversation . The New York Times reported that “ a friend ” said she learned of the alleged assault from Reade in 1993 and that a “ second friend ” recalled Reade “ telling her in 2008 that Mr. Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she ’ d had a traumatic experience while working in his office. ” The Associated Press also reported similar conversations with two friends of Reade ’ s .

We later expanded the list for Trump in 2017, eventually reaching a total of 16 women, after more allegations emerged. (See the video below.)

As we noted, contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chances that a person is making up a story for political purposes. In the case of sexual allegations, such accounts can help bolster the credibility of the “she said” side of the equation. Often, a sexual assault will happen behind closed doors. The contemporary corroborators can explain what they heard at the time and whether the story being told now is consistent with how the story was told years earlier. This does not necessarily mean the allegation is true, but it does give a journalistic organization more confidence to report on the allegation.

sexual_misconduct,Time Magazine,0,http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/,The Silence Breakers,,,"Movie stars are supposedly nothing like you and me . They 're svelte , glamorous , self-­possessed . They wear dresses we ca n't afford and live in houses we can only dream of . Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew .
In 1997 , just before Ashley Judd 's career took off , she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein , head of the starmaking studio Miramax , at a Beverly Hills hotel . Astounded and offended by Weinstein 's attempt to coerce her into bed , Judd managed to escape . But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence , she began spreading the word .
`` I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened , '' Judd says in an interview with TIME . `` Literally , I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby , where my dad was waiting for me , because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky , visiting me on the set . And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me . I told him . I told everyone . ''
She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein 's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years . It allowed for people to warn others to some degree , but there was no route to stop the abuse . `` Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom ? '' Judd asks . `` There was n't a place for us to report these experiences . ''
Finally , in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein 's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened . ( Weinstein said he `` never laid a glove '' on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers . )
When movie stars do n't know where to go , what hope is there for the rest of us ? What hope is there for the janitor who 's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she 'll lose the job she needs to support her children ? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who wo n't take no for an answer ? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows , as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets , if a guest is going to corner her in a room she ca n't escape ?
Like the `` problem that has no name , '' the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago , this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest . Yet it does n't have a leader , or a single , unifying tenet . The hashtag # MeToo ( swiftly adapted into # BalanceTonPorc , # YoTambien , # Ana_kaman and many others ) , which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories , is part of the picture , but not all of it .
This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight . But it has actually been simmering for years , decades , centuries . Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but do n't even seem to know that boundaries exist . They 've had it with the fear of retaliation , of being blackballed , of being fired from a job they ca n't afford to lose . They 've had it with the code of going along to get along . They 've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women . These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal , gathering strength by the day , and in the past two months alone , their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results : nearly every day , CEOs have been fired , moguls toppled , icons disgraced . In some cases , criminal charges have been brought .
Emboldened by Judd , Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers , women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate , abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they 've faced . When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer , women who thought they had no recourse see a new , wide-open door . When a movie star says # MeToo , it becomes easier to believe the cook who 's been quietly enduring for years .
'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM ? ' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old . ‘ We need to formalize the whisper network . It 's an ingenious way that we 've tried to keep ourselves safe . All those voices can be amplified . That 's my advice to women . That and if something feels wrong , it is wrong—and it 's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else 's . ’ Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove ' on Judd .
The women and men who have broken their silence span all races , all income classes , all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe . They might labor in California fields , or behind the front desk at New York City 's regal Plaza Hotel , or in the European Parliament . They 're part of a movement that has no formal name . But now they have a voice .
In a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco 's Mission District , a group of women from different worlds met for the first time . Judd , every bit the movie star in towering heels , leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual , a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family . Beside her , Susan Fowler , a former Uber engineer , eight months pregnant , spoke softly with Adama Iwu , a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento . A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle . She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously , she said , as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out .
From a distance , these women could not have looked more different . Their ages , their families , their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart . Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe : Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months .
But on that November morning , what separated them was less important than what brought them together : a shared experience . Over the course of six weeks , TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries , all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs . They often had eerily similar stories to share .
In almost every case , they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself—years of lewd comments , forced kisses , opportunistic gropes—but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances . Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame . Had she somehow asked for it ? Could she have deflected it ? Was she making a big deal out of nothing ?
`` I thought , What just happened ? Why did n't I react ? '' says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family 's livelihood should her story come out in her small community . `` I kept thinking , Did I do something , did I say something , did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K. ? '' It 's a poisonous , useless thought , she adds , but how do you avoid it ? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day . She can still feel the heat of her harasser 's hands on her body .
Alyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag # MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter . ‘ It 's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories . I do n't know if I 'll ever be the same . I have not stopped crying . I look at my daughter and think , Please , let this be worth it . Please , let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this . ’ Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke , founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence , created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another . It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag # MeToo . ‘ Sexual harassment does bring shame . And I think it 's really powerful that this transfer is happening , that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs : on the perpetrator . ’
Nearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally , to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up .
For some , the fear was born of a threat of physical violence . Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home , but felt she was powerless to stop him . If she told anyone , the abuser warned her , he would come after her or her children .
Those who are often most vulnerable in society—immigrants , people of color , people with disabilities , low-income workers and LGBTQ people—described many types of dread . If they raised their voices , would they be fired ? Would their communities turn against them ? Would they be killed ? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality , 47 % of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives , both in and out of the workplace .
'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM , HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED , HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER . ' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them , Blair spoke out about her encounter with him . ‘ I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial . He called the women liars . But their stories were so similar to mine , and they were such credible women . There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story , be free of this story . And in a magazine interview , he called the people who said this about him ' c-nts ' and ' c-cksuckers . ' That was just wrong . And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out . ’ Toback has denied all allegations of harassment .
Juana Melara , who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades , says she and her fellow housekeepers did n't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families . Melara recalls `` feeling the pressure of someone 's eyes '' on her as she cleaned a guest 's room . When she turned around , she remembers , a man was standing in the doorway , blocked by the cleaning cart , with his erect penis exposed . She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving , then locked the door behind him . `` Nothing happened to me that time , thank God , '' she recalls .
While guests come and go , some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers . Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza , a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite . `` Walking in , it 's breathtaking , '' she says .
But then , she says , a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like `` I can tell you had sex last night '' and groping her . One of those encounters was even caught on camera , but the management did not properly respond , her lawyers say .
Plaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left : Veronica Owusu , Gabrielle Eubank , Crystal Washington , Dana Lewis , Paige Rodriguez , Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City 's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault ' among employees there . ‘ ' I am a single mother . I have an 11-year-old daughter , and she 's depending on me , ' says Lewis , who still works at the hotel to make ends meet . 'My entire life revolves around her . I was n't really left with the option of leaving . I 'm not left with the option of giving up . I want to show her that it 's O.K . to stand up for yourself . If you keep fighting , eventually you 'll see the sun on the other side . ' ’ Fairmont Hotels & Resorts , which owns the Plaza , said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted .
Washington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel . But she can not afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she 's accused . `` It 's a dream to be an employee there , '' Washington says . `` And then you find out what it really is , and it 's a nightmare . '' ( Fairmont Hotels & Resorts , which owns the Plaza , said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted . )
Other women , like the actor Selma Blair , weathered excruciating threats . Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room . There , she says , Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down . She took her top off . She says he then propositioned her for sex , and when she refused , he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg . Afterward , she recalls him telling her that if she said anything , he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River .
Blair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades . `` I had heard from others that he was slandering me , saying these sexual things about me , and it just made me even more afraid of him , '' Blair says in an interview with TIME . `` I genuinely thought for almost 20 years , He 's going to kill me . '' ( Toback has denied the allegations , saying he never met his accusers or does n't remember them . )
Many of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear , one less visceral but no less real , as a reason for not speaking out : if you do , your complaint becomes your identity . `` 'Susan Fowler , the famous victim of sexual harassment , ' '' says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees . `` Nobody wants to be the buzzkill , '' adds Lindsey Reynolds , one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh . ( The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect . Besh apologized for `` unacceptable behavior '' and `` moral failings , '' and resigned from the company . )
Iwu , the lobbyist , says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event . She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault . The next week , she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government . When she told people about the campaign , she says they were wary . `` Are you sure you want to do this ? '' they warned her . `` Remember Anita Hill . ''
Sara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment , the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments . ‘ We ca n't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in . And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it 's a member of our own party . ’ Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately . Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her . ‘ I thought , What just happened ? Why did n't I react ? Why could n't I force words out of my mouth ? When I got home , I crumbled . I kept thinking , Did I do something , did I say something , did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K. ? ’
Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced . After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller , who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end , Mueller was fired . He sued Swift for millions in damages . She countersued for a symbolic $ 1 and then testified about the incident in August . Mueller 's lawyer asked her , on the witness stand , whether she felt bad that she 'd gotten him fired .
`` I 'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault , '' she told the lawyer . `` I 'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions . Not mine . '' ( Mueller said he would appeal . )
In an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation . `` I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances , '' she says , `` imagine what he might do to a vulnerable , young artist if given the chance . '' Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco , and like all of the dozens , then hundreds , then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment , she was done feeling intimidated . Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike : they 'd had enough . What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage . Fear became fury .
'WHEN I TESTIFIED , I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN 'S ATTORNEY BULLY , BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM , INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY . ' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013 . She reported him to his radio station , KYGO , and he was terminated . He said her accusations were false and sued Swift . She countersued for $ 1 and won . ‘ In that moment , I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened . This man had n't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite ? ’ Mueller 's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment .
This was the great unleashing that turned the # MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry . The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault . A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase , and Milano , almost on a whim , tweeted it out on Oct. 15 . `` If you 've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too ' as a reply to this tweet , '' she wrote , and then went to sleep . She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used # MeToo . Milano burst into tears .
At first , those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment , but the hashtag quickly spread . `` We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender , '' says Burke , who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages . By November , California farmworkers , Pascual among them , were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars .
Women were no longer alone . `` There 's something really empowering about standing up for what 's right , '' says Fowler , who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower . `` It 's a badge of honor . ''
Discussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms : harassment becomes `` inappropriate behavior , '' assault becomes ­ '' misconduct , '' rape becomes `` abuse . '' We 're accustomed to hearing those softened words , which downplay the pain of the experience . That 's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt . The language used by the man who would become America 's 45th President , captured on a 2005 recording , was , by any standard , vulgar . He did n't just say that he 'd made a pass ; he `` moved on her like a bitch . '' He did n't just talk about fondling women ; he bragged that he could `` grab 'em by the pussy . ''
That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women 's March the day after his Inauguration . It 's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump 's Inauguration crowd size . `` All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors , '' says Aldon Morris , a professor of sociology at Northwestern University . `` In this case , you had Harvey Weinstein , and before that you had Trump . ''
Megyn Kelly , the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly 's treatment of women , and who was a target of Trump 's ire during the campaign , says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal . `` I have real doubts about whether we 'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won , because I think that President Trump 's election in many ways was a setback for women , '' says Kelly , who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters . `` But the overall message to us was that we do n't really matter . ''
'WE 'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME . I DO N'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE . ' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room . McGowan 's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser . ‘ The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense , especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well . People forget a lot that there 's a human behind this , someone who is very hurt . But that 's O.K . It fuels my fire . They really f-cked with the wrong person . ’ Weinstein has denied all allegations of non­consensual sex .
So it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning `` pussy hats '' and marching on the nation 's capital in a show of unity and fury . What was startling was the size of the protest . It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries .
Summer Zervos , a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment . She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar . A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office . No matter the outcome , the allegations added fuel to a growing fire .
By February , the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley , when Fowler spoke out about her `` weird year '' as an engineer at Uber . `` I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House , '' Fowler says . `` I felt like I had to take action . ''
Barely two months later , Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $ 13 million to settle claims against him from five women . In October , the Times revealed a sixth settlement , bringing that total to more than $ 45 million . Wendy Walsh , a psychologist and former guest on the network , was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor—but she was initially reluctant to go on the record . `` I was afraid for my kids , I was afraid of the retaliation , '' she says . `` I know what men can do when they 're angry . ''
Eventually she allowed her name to be used . `` I felt it was my duty , '' Walsh says , `` as a mother of daughters , as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced , to be brave . ''
The downfall of O'Reilly , who has denied all allegations of harassment , would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment . In June , Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand , one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades . Although the case ended in a mistrial—it is scheduled to be retried in April—the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture , a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds .
Wendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment , Fox News fired him . ‘ In the early '90s , as a news anchor , I wore buttoned-up suits , skirts to my knees , sensible shoes . I dipped out of the industry . When I came back , I was put in a sausage dress . The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher . Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter : any woman , even a woman with advanced degrees , would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy . Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room . ’ O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues . Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh , Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company 's culture of sexism . She later filed a complaint with the EEOC . Besh has since stepped down . ‘ After I sent that email , I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking . I was nobody . I 'm just a person from a small town in Texas . I have no money , no power , no social standing . And they have more power and money than I will ever have . I felt extremely vulnerable and scared . Then I heard from women I had never met—they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate—who had experienced the same toxic culture . ’ The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect . Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable ' behavior and 'moral failings , ' and resigned .
Complaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia . The chief executive of SoFi , the $ 4 billion lending firm , resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment . Then , in early October , the dam finally broke .
On Oct. 5 , the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein , one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser , as a serial sexual predator . The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein 's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks . Weinstein denied the allegations , but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed . Fellow chieftains refused to defend him . Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations . His company 's board fired him .
Within days , the head of Amazon Studios , an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims . By the end of the month , the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin , a former TIME employee ; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier ; and numerous politicians and journalists . The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie .
'IT DOES N'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME . I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING . ' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein , Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers . ‘ I was afraid . When the man was harassing me , he threatened to harm my children and me—that 's why I kept quiet . I felt desperate . I cried and cried . But , thank God , my friends in the fields support me . So I said , Enough . I lost the fear . It does n't matter if they criticize me . I can support other people who are going through the same thing . ’ * Pascual 's name was changed to protect her family .
The response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward . In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28–30 , 82 % of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations . Meanwhile , 85 % say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment .
The movement—and fallout—quickly spread around the world . Michael Fallon , Britain 's Defense Secretary , quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had `` lunged '' at her in 2003 , when she was a 29-year-old reporter . In France , women took to the streets chanting not only `` Me too '' but also `` Balance ton porc , '' which translates roughly to `` Expose your pig , '' a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller . In the week after # MeToo first surfaced , versions of it swept through 85 countries , from India , where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years , to the Middle East , Asia and parts in between .
Lindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck , a venture capitalist who invested in her first company , harassed her . After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck , he resigned from his firm . ‘ I wanted it to stop . I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed , called , text-messaged . That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury—because I did n't want it to be a big deal . For so long , I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way . And now I see that that is so silly . I am a person with dignity . ’ Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable . ' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working . ‘ One time when I was cleaning , a guest asked me if I knew how to massage . I said , 'No , I do n't even do it to my husband . ' The way he was looking at me was n't friendly . I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there . It 's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room , they are paying for sexual service . ’ The hotel declined to comment .
`` Suddenly , '' says Terry Reintke , a German member of the European Parliament , who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25 , `` friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories . ''
By November , the spotlight was back on American politicians . A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore , the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate , abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney . Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore , including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers . Moore has called the allegations `` false '' and `` malicious . '' `` Specifically , I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman , '' he said in late November .
' I 'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT , BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END . ' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France , Muller started the Twitter hashtag # BalanceTonPorc ( Expose Your Pig ) , which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment . ‘ France is a country of love , but there is love and love , you know ? There are ways to approach a woman , and if it 's done with respect , it 's O.K . Without respect , it 's not good . Now if men want your love , they have to ask themselves how to be , how to approach a woman . They are scared . We must restart all relationships from the beginning . We have to cleanse society to find a better way . I 'm sure the road will be long and difficult , but it will be positive in the end . ’
The following week , radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006 , before he was in office . Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken , who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior . On Dec. 5 , Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff . He has said that the allegations `` are not accurate ; they are not true . ''
Texas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $ 84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014 . Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement .
'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION , I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS . AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING . ' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler 's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral . Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees . ‘ When other women spoke out , they were retaliated against . So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid : ' I 'm not going to sue , because they 'll make me sign a non­disclosure agreement . I 'm not going to do press right afterward , because they 'll say I 'm doing it for attention . I ca n't have any emotion in my blog . I have to be very , very detached . ' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation , so it could n't be 'he said , she said . ' And that 's what I did . ’
The accused were both Democrats and Republicans , but the consequences thus far have been limited—and often filtered through a partisan lens . In politics , at least , what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe . In the 1990s , feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his ­accusers—a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President . And despite the allegations against Moore , both ­President Trump and the Republican National Committee support him .
That political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll , which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party . The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign ( 71 % and 74 % respectively ) , when the accused offender was in the GOP , only 54 % of Republicans would demand a resignation ( compared to 82 % of Democrats ) .
'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE ? LET 'S FLIP IT . LET 'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING . ' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault . Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event . Venit was briefly suspended from the agency . ‘ People were saying , 'You should have beaten him up . ' I 'm like , Why is nobody questioning him ? Nobody questions the predator . You know why ? Because they just expect it . And I expect it . And I just said , 'No more . ' Why are you questioning the victim here ? Let 's flip it . Let 's talk about what the predator is doing . ’ The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit , who declined to comment .
As another election cycle approaches , Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression . Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported ? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics ?
It was n't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope , a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms . There was n't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago ; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there , Carmita Wood , filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her . The university denied her claim , arguing that she left the job for `` personal reasons . ''
University Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd ( right ) and Jessica Cantlon ( left ) , along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department , filed complaints with the university and the EEOC , alleging harassment and retaliation . ‘ 'If they could n't stop us from talking , they were going to stop every­body from listening , ' says Cantlon . 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us . But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint . I think working together was powerful . It was hard to silence all of us . ' ’ The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White .
Wood , joined by activists from the university 's human-affairs program , formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields , from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants , to talk about their own harassment experiences .
It was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we 're seeing today , encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone . But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow , legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent . In the 1970s , most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever , and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed .
' I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER . I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME . ' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC 's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior . She had . In 2016 , Kelly revealed that she 'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes . ‘ I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter . I never thought things could change for me . Never . I believed the system was stacked against women , and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I 'm starting to see it so differently . What if we did complain ? What if we did n't whine , but insisted that those around us did better ? ’ Ailes denied Kelly 's claims of harassment before he died in May . O'Reilly said he did n't know of any complaint by Kelly .
In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) , the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace , issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act . It was a victory , but with caveats : even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal , it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck—in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define . What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate ? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal ? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition , interpretation has evolved slowly , shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years .
In 1991 , Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court , accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue . But , she says , `` The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace . It was about the fallout in politics . ''
More From left : Jane Merrick , journalist ; Zelda Perkins , producer ; Terry Reintke , Parliament member ; Bex Bailey , charity worker . ‘ Britain 's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged ' at her when she was a young reporter : ' I think we 're all part of this movement . On Twitter , there are n't any country borders , because it 's such a powerful thing . There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country. ” ’ Fallon said in a statement that he 's 'behaved inappropriately in the past . ' Kate Peters for TIME
Even now , the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky . Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line , like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap . But others feel more ambiguous . Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage ? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far ?
Jonathan Segal , a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris , who specializes in workplace training , says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves . `` It 's more like , ' I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice , I wonder when it 's O.K . to give a hug , I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room , ' '' he says .
Amanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum , Knight Landesman , stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment . ‘ The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City . I was trying to figure out my place in the art world , my place in the city , my place as an adult in the workplace . The harassment began so early , and it was so accepted in the industry . When I finally spoke out publicly , I wondered why I had n't sooner . I was afraid that I did n't have the strength to make it stop . I do n't feel that fear anymore . ’ Artforum 's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt . Landesman could not be reached for comment . Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California 's capital , which launched a state-senate investigation . ‘ Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago . And all I did was participate in the whisper network : 'Here 's what you can wear , ' 'Here 's where you can go , ' 'Here 's who to avoid . ' But you have to address it head on and as a group . It 's hard to call 147 women liars . We ca n't all be crazy . We ca n't all be sluts . ’
This uncertainty can be corrosive . While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists , there is a risk that the net may be cast too far . What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee ? Neither should be encouraged , but nor should they be equated .
Companies , meanwhile , are scrambling to keep up . Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment , and many have anti–sexual harassment training programs and claim to be `` zero-­tolerance workplaces . '' A 2016 EEOC report found that a company 's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers—high-performing men like Kalanick , Weinstein and O'Reilly—to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-­suites and corporate boards overlooked harassment . It does n't matter how good a company 's policy is if its systems are ignored or do n't work . `` So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office , '' says Victoria Lipnic , the acting chair of the EEOC .
In some instances , sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire . In a 2001 study , Lisa Scherer , an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha , found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment , it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture . `` What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect , '' she says . `` They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training . ''
Employers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits . The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15 % increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017 . And Advisen , which tracks insurance trends , says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30 % since 2011 , which indicates that more companies are reporting losses .
Corporate boards , wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press , have been among the quickest to make changes . Uber , for example , which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms , used to be a guiding light for small startups . Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber , says Fowler . `` There 's a shift to , 'We 're not disrupting anymore . We 're trying to build something that 's good for consumers and treats employees fairly . ' '' It 's a start .
State and local governments have also taken some concrete steps . In October , the Chicago city council passed an ordinance­ requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms . In Springfield , Ill. , lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-­harassment complaints in the statehouse . In Arizona , pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent .
' I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY . AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE 'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS . ' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her , this young Native American woman says she felt trapped . Her office had no HR department . She did n't feel her colleagues or family on her small , conservative reservation would believe her . So she quit her job . ‘ On the reservation , we keep to ourselves and do n't really put too much out there . I thought of all the other people that had no voice . They 're scared to do something like this because their parents say , 'You 're not supposed to do that . You 're not supposed to speak up . ' ’
At the federal level , the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training . A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements—legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason , including sexual harassment . Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them .
We 're still at the bomb-throwing point of this revolution , a reactive stage at which nuance can go into hiding . But while anger can start a revolution , in its most raw and feral form it ca n't negotiate the more delicate dance steps needed for true social change . Private conversations , which ca n't be legislated or enforced , are essential .
Norms evolve , and it 's long past time for any culture to view harassment as acceptable . But there 's a great deal at stake in how we assess these new boundaries—for women and men together . We can and should police criminal acts and discourage inappropriate , destructive behavior .
At least we 've started asking the right questions . Ones that seem alarmingly basic in hindsight : `` What if we did complain ? '' proposes Megyn Kelly . `` What if we did n't whine , but we spoke our truth in our strongest voices and insisted that those around us did better ? What if that worked to change reality right now ? '' Kelly acknowledges that this still feels more like a promise than a certainty . But for the moment , the world is listening .

Correction : The original version of this story misstated when the claims settled by Bill O ’ Reilly and Fox News were first disclosed . The New York Times reported in April that Fox and O ’ Reilly had settled five claims against him . O ’ Reilly left the network later that month .","Movie stars are supposedly nothing like you and me. They're svelte, glamorous, self-­possessed. They wear dresses we can't afford and live in houses we can only dream of. Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew.

In 1997, just before Ashley Judd's career took off, she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein, head of the starmaking studio Miramax, at a Beverly Hills hotel. Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word.

""I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,"" Judd says in an interview with TIME. ""Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me. I told him. I told everyone.""

TIME

She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years. It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. ""Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?"" Judd asks. ""There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.""

Finally, in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened. (Weinstein said he ""never laid a glove"" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.)

When movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape?

Like the ""problem that has no name,"" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it.

This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.

Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #MeToo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years.

'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM?' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old. ‘ We need to formalize the whisper network. It's an ingenious way that we've tried to keep ourselves safe. All those voices can be amplified. That's my advice to women. That and if something feels wrong, it is wrong—and it's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else's. ’ Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove' on Judd.

The women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City's regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They're part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.

II

In a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco's Mission District, a group of women from different worlds met for the first time. Judd, every bit the movie star in towering heels, leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual, a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family. Beside her, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, eight months pregnant, spoke softly with Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento. A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out.

From a distance, these women could not have looked more different. Their ages, their families, their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart. Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe: Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months.

But on that November morning, what separated them was less important than what brought them together: a shared experience. Over the course of six weeks, TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries, all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs. They often had eerily similar stories to share.

In almost every case, they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself—years of lewd comments, forced kisses, opportunistic gropes—but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances. Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame. Had she somehow asked for it? Could she have deflected it? Was she making a big deal out of nothing?

""I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react?"" says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family's livelihood should her story come out in her small community. ""I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.?"" It's a poisonous, useless thought, she adds, but how do you avoid it? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day. She can still feel the heat of her harasser's hands on her body.

Alyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag #MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter. ‘ It's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I have not stopped crying. I look at my daughter and think, Please, let this be worth it. Please, let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this. ’ Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence, created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. ‘ Sexual harassment does bring shame. And I think it's really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. ’

Nearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.

For some, the fear was born of a threat of physical violence. Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home, but felt she was powerless to stop him. If she told anyone, the abuser warned her, he would come after her or her children.

Those who are often most vulnerable in society—immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people—described many types of dread. If they raised their voices, would they be fired? Would their communities turn against them? Would they be killed? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 47% of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, both in and out of the workplace.

'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED, HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER.' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them, Blair spoke out about her encounter with him. ‘ I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial. He called the women liars. But their stories were so similar to mine, and they were such credible women. There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story, be free of this story. And in a magazine interview, he called the people who said this about him 'c-nts' and 'c-cksuckers.' That was just wrong. And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out. ’ Toback has denied all allegations of harassment.

Juana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls ""feeling the pressure of someone's eyes"" on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. ""Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,"" she recalls.

While guests come and go, some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers. Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza, a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite. ""Walking in, it's breathtaking,"" she says.

But then, she says, a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like ""I can tell you had sex last night"" and groping her. One of those encounters was even caught on camera, but the management did not properly respond, her lawyers say.

Plaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left: Veronica Owusu, Gabrielle Eubank, Crystal Washington, Dana Lewis, Paige Rodriguez, Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault' among employees there. ‘ 'I am a single mother. I have an 11-year-old daughter, and she's depending on me,' says Lewis, who still works at the hotel to make ends meet. 'My entire life revolves around her. I wasn't really left with the option of leaving. I'm not left with the option of giving up. I want to show her that it's O.K. to stand up for yourself. If you keep fighting, eventually you'll see the sun on the other side.' ’ Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.

Washington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel. But she cannot afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she's accused. ""It's a dream to be an employee there,"" Washington says. ""And then you find out what it really is, and it's a nightmare."" (Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.)

Other women, like the actor Selma Blair, weathered excruciating threats. Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room. There, she says, Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down. She took her top off. She says he then propositioned her for sex, and when she refused, he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg. Afterward, she recalls him telling her that if she said anything, he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River.

Blair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades. ""I had heard from others that he was slandering me, saying these sexual things about me, and it just made me even more afraid of him,"" Blair says in an interview with TIME. ""I genuinely thought for almost 20 years, He's going to kill me."" ( Toback has denied the allegations, saying he never met his accusers or doesn't remember them.)

Many of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear, one less visceral but no less real, as a reason for not speaking out: if you do, your complaint becomes your identity. ""'Susan Fowler, the famous victim of sexual harassment,'"" says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees. ""Nobody wants to be the buzzkill,"" adds Lindsey Reynolds, one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh. (The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect. Besh apologized for ""unacceptable behavior"" and ""moral failings,"" and resigned from the company. )

Iwu, the lobbyist, says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event. She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault. The next week, she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government. When she told people about the campaign, she says they were wary. ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" they warned her. ""Remember Anita Hill.""

Sara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment, the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments. ‘ We can't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in. And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it's a member of our own party. ’ Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately. Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her. ‘ I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react? Why couldn't I force words out of my mouth? When I got home, I crumbled. I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.? ’

Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller's lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she'd gotten him fired.

""I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,"" she told the lawyer. ""I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine."" (Mueller said he would appeal.)

In an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. ""I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,"" she says, ""imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance."" Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they'd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury.

'WHEN I TESTIFIED, I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN'S ATTORNEY BULLY, BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM, INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY.' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013. She reported him to his radio station, KYGO, and he was terminated. He said her accusations were false and sued Swift. She countersued for $1 and won. ‘ In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite? ’ Mueller's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

This was the great unleashing that turned the #MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry. The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault. A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase, and Milano, almost on a whim, tweeted it out on Oct. 15. ""If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,"" she wrote, and then went to sleep. She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used #MeToo. Milano burst into tears.

At first, those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment, but the hashtag quickly spread. ""We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender,"" says Burke, who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages. By November, California farmworkers, Pascual among them, were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars.

Women were no longer alone. ""There's something really empowering about standing up for what's right,"" says Fowler, who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower. ""It's a badge of honor.""

Sandra Pezqueda 37 Former Dishwasher More Pezqueda filed a suit alleging that her supervisor at the Terranea Resort, a luxury retreat in South California, pursued her for months. When she rebuffed him, he changed her schedule and cut her hours. ‘ Someone who is in the limelight is able to speak out more easily than people who are poor. The reality of being a woman is the same—the difference is the risk each woman must take. ’ Attorneys for the staffing company that employed Pezqueda deny her allegations. Terranea Resort declined to comment except to say that the suit involves an outside agency. Blaise Godbe Lipman 28 Director More Lipman accused a former agent, Tyler Grasham, of sexually assaulting him when he was 18. Grasham has since been dismissed by his agency and is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. ‘ I experienced a little bit of victim blaming, victim shaming—people digging into my Instagram and pulling up sexy photos, as if that discredited me from speaking out against sexual violence. And gay men are often highly sexualized in the media, so coming out with a story of sexual assault, especially one that also involved alcohol and maybe drugs, there is an idea that 'Well, did you want it?.' ’ Grasham could not be reached for comment. Correction: The original version of this caption incorrectly said Tyler Grasham was Lipman’s agent. Grasham never represented Lipman.

Discussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms: harassment becomes ""inappropriate behavior,"" assault becomes ­""misconduct,"" rape becomes ""abuse."" We're accustomed to hearing those softened words, which downplay the pain of the experience. That's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt. The language used by the man who would become America's 45th President, captured on a 2005 recording, was, by any standard, vulgar. He didn't just say that he'd made a pass; he ""moved on her like a bitch."" He didn't just talk about fondling women; he bragged that he could ""grab 'em by the pussy.""

That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration. It's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size. ""All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors,"" says Aldon Morris, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. ""In this case, you had Harvey Weinstein, and before that you had Trump.""

Megyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. ""I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,"" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. ""But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.""

'WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE.' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room. McGowan's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser. ‘ The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense, especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well. People forget a lot that there's a human behind this, someone who is very hurt. But that's O.K. It fuels my fire. They really f-cked with the wrong person. ’ Weinstein has denied all allegations of non­consensual sex.

So it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning ""pussy hats"" and marching on the nation's capital in a show of unity and fury. What was startling was the size of the protest. It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries.

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment. She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar. A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office. No matter the outcome, the allegations added fuel to a growing fire.

By February, the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley, when Fowler spoke out about her ""weird year"" as an engineer at Uber. ""I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,"" Fowler says. ""I felt like I had to take action.""

Barely two months later, Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $13 million to settle claims against him from five women. In October, the Times revealed a sixth settlement, bringing that total to more than $45 million. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and former guest on the network, was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor—but she was initially reluctant to go on the record. ""I was afraid for my kids, I was afraid of the retaliation,"" she says. ""I know what men can do when they're angry.""

Eventually she allowed her name to be used. ""I felt it was my duty,"" Walsh says, ""as a mother of daughters, as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced, to be brave.""

The downfall of O'Reilly, who has denied all allegations of harassment, would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment. In June, Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand, one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades. Although the case ended in a mistrial—it is scheduled to be retried in April—the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture, a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds.

Wendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, Fox News fired him. ‘ In the early '90s, as a news anchor, I wore buttoned-up suits, skirts to my knees, sensible shoes. I dipped out of the industry. When I came back, I was put in a sausage dress. The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher. Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter: any woman, even a woman with advanced degrees, would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy. Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room. ’ O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues. Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh, Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company's culture of sexism. She later filed a complaint with the EEOC. Besh has since stepped down. ‘ After I sent that email, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking. I was nobody. I'm just a person from a small town in Texas. I have no money, no power, no social standing. And they have more power and money than I will ever have. I felt extremely vulnerable and scared. Then I heard from women I had never met—they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate—who had experienced the same toxic culture. ’ The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect. Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable' behavior and 'moral failings,' and resigned.

Complaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia. The chief executive of SoFi, the $4 billion lending firm, resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment. Then, in early October, the dam finally broke.

On Oct. 5, the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser, as a serial sexual predator. The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks. Weinstein denied the allegations, but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed. Fellow chieftains refused to defend him. Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations. His company's board fired him.

Within days, the head of Amazon Studios, an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims. By the end of the month, the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin, a former TIME employee; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier; and numerous politicians and journalists. The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie.

'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME. I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers. ‘ I was afraid. When the man was harassing me, he threatened to harm my children and me—that's why I kept quiet. I felt desperate. I cried and cried. But, thank God, my friends in the fields support me. So I said, Enough. I lost the fear. It doesn't matter if they criticize me. I can support other people who are going through the same thing. ’ *Pascual's name was changed to protect her family.

The response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward. In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28–30, 82% of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations. Meanwhile, 85% say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment.

The movement—and fallout—quickly spread around the world. Michael Fallon, Britain's Defense Secretary, quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had ""lunged"" at her in 2003, when she was a 29-year-old reporter. In France, women took to the streets chanting not only ""Me too"" but also ""Balance ton porc ,"" which translates roughly to ""Expose your pig,"" a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller. In the week after #MeToo first surfaced, versions of it swept through 85 countries, from India, where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years, to the Middle East, Asia and parts in between.

Lindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who invested in her first company, harassed her. After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck, he resigned from his firm. ‘ I wanted it to stop. I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed, called, text-messaged. That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury—because I didn't want it to be a big deal. For so long, I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way. And now I see that that is so silly. I am a person with dignity. ’ Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable.' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working. ‘ One time when I was cleaning, a guest asked me if I knew how to massage. I said, 'No, I don't even do it to my husband.' The way he was looking at me wasn't friendly. I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there. It's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room, they are paying for sexual service. ’ The hotel declined to comment.

""Suddenly,"" says Terry Reintke, a German member of the European Parliament, who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25, ""friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories.""

By November, the spotlight was back on American politicians. A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate, abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore, including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers. Moore has called the allegations ""false"" and ""malicious."" ""Specifically, I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman,"" he said in late November.

'I'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END.' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France, Muller started the Twitter hashtag #BalanceTonPorc (Expose Your Pig), which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment. ‘ France is a country of love, but there is love and love, you know? There are ways to approach a woman, and if it's done with respect, it's O.K. Without respect, it's not good. Now if men want your love, they have to ask themselves how to be, how to approach a woman. They are scared. We must restart all relationships from the beginning. We have to cleanse society to find a better way. I'm sure the road will be long and difficult, but it will be positive in the end. ’

The following week, radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006, before he was in office. Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken, who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior. On Dec. 5, Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff. He has said that the allegations ""are not accurate; they are not true.""

Texas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014. Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement.

'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral. Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees. ‘ When other women spoke out, they were retaliated against. So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid: 'I'm not going to sue, because they'll make me sign a non­disclosure agreement. I'm not going to do press right afterward, because they'll say I'm doing it for attention. I can't have any emotion in my blog. I have to be very, very detached.' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation, so it couldn't be 'he said, she said.' And that's what I did. ’

The accused were both Democrats and Republicans, but the consequences thus far have been limited—and often filtered through a partisan lens. In politics, at least, what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe. In the 1990s, feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his ­accusers—a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President. And despite the allegations against Moore, both ­President Trump and the Republican National Committee support him.

That political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll, which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party. The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign (71% and 74% respectively), when the accused offender was in the GOP, only 54% of Republicans would demand a resignation (compared to 82% of Democrats).

'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE? LET'S FLIP IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING.' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault. Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event. Venit was briefly suspended from the agency. ‘ People were saying, 'You should have beaten him up.' I'm like, Why is nobody questioning him? Nobody questions the predator. You know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, 'No more.' Why are you questioning the victim here? Let's flip it. Let's talk about what the predator is doing. ’ The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit, who declined to comment.

As another election cycle approaches, Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression. Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics?

It wasn't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope, a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms. There wasn't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there, Carmita Wood, filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her. The university denied her claim, arguing that she left the job for ""personal reasons.""

University Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd (right) and Jessica Cantlon (left), along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department, filed complaints with the university and the EEOC, alleging harassment and retaliation. ‘ 'If they couldn't stop us from talking, they were going to stop every­body from listening,' says Cantlon. 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us. But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint. I think working together was powerful. It was hard to silence all of us.' ’ The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.

Wood, joined by activists from the university's human-affairs program, formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields, from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants, to talk about their own harassment experiences.

It was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we're seeing today, encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone. But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow, legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent. In the 1970s, most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever, and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed.

'I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME.' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior. She had. In 2016, Kelly revealed that she'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. ‘ I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter. I never thought things could change for me. Never. I believed the system was stacked against women, and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I'm starting to see it so differently. What if we did complain? What if we didn't whine, but insisted that those around us did better? ’ Ailes denied Kelly's claims of harassment before he died in May. O'Reilly said he didn't know of any complaint by Kelly.

In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It was a victory, but with caveats: even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal, it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck—in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define. What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition, interpretation has evolved slowly, shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years.

In 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue. But, she says, ""The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace. It was about the fallout in politics.""

More From left: Jane Merrick, journalist; Zelda Perkins, producer; Terry Reintke, Parliament member; Bex Bailey, charity worker. ‘ Britain's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged' at her when she was a young reporter: 'I think we're all part of this movement. On Twitter, there aren't any country borders, because it's such a powerful thing. There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country.” ’ Fallon said in a statement that he's 'behaved inappropriately in the past.' Kate Peters for TIME

Even now, the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky. Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line, like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap. But others feel more ambiguous. Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far?

Jonathan Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris, who specializes in workplace training, says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves. ""It's more like, 'I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice, I wonder when it's O.K. to give a hug, I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room,'"" he says.

Amanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment. ‘ The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City. I was trying to figure out my place in the art world, my place in the city, my place as an adult in the workplace. The harassment began so early, and it was so accepted in the industry. When I finally spoke out publicly, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. I was afraid that I didn't have the strength to make it stop. I don't feel that fear anymore. ’ Artforum's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt. Landesman could not be reached for comment. Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California's capital, which launched a state-senate investigation. ‘ Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago. And all I did was participate in the whisper network: 'Here's what you can wear,' 'Here's where you can go,' 'Here's who to avoid.' But you have to address it head on and as a group. It's hard to call 147 women liars. We can't all be crazy. We can't all be sluts. ’

This uncertainty can be corrosive. While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists, there is a risk that the net may be cast too far. What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee? Neither should be encouraged, but nor should they be equated.

Companies, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep up. Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment, and many have anti–sexual harassment training programs and claim to be ""zero-­tolerance workplaces."" A 2016 EEOC report found that a company's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers—high-performing men like Kalanick, Weinstein and O'Reilly—to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-­suites and corporate boards overlooked harassment. It doesn't matter how good a company's policy is if its systems are ignored or don't work. ""So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office ,"" says Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the EEOC.

In some instances, sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire. In a 2001 study, Lisa Scherer, an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment, it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture. ""What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect,"" she says. ""They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training.""

Employers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits. The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15% increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017. And Advisen, which tracks insurance trends, says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30% since 2011, which indicates that more companies are reporting losses.

Corporate boards, wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press, have been among the quickest to make changes. Uber, for example, which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms, used to be a guiding light for small startups. Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber, says Fowler. ""There's a shift to, 'We're not disrupting anymore. We're trying to build something that's good for consumers and treats employees fairly.'"" It's a start.

State and local governments have also taken some concrete steps. In October, the Chicago city council passed an ordinance­ requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms. In Springfield, Ill., lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-­harassment complaints in the statehouse. In Arizona, pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent.

'I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS.' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her, this young Native American woman says she felt trapped. Her office had no HR department. She didn't feel her colleagues or family on her small, conservative reservation would believe her. So she quit her job. ‘ On the reservation, we keep to ourselves and don't really put too much out there. I thought of all the other people that had no voice. They're scared to do something like this because their parents say, 'You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to speak up.' ’

At the federal level, the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training. A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements—legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason, including sexual harassment. Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them.

We're still at the bomb-throwing point of this revolution, a reactive stage at which nuance can go into hiding. But while anger can start a revolution, in its most raw and feral form it can't negotiate the more delicate dance steps needed for true social change. Private conversations, which can't be legislated or enforced, are essential.

Norms evolve, and it's long past time for any culture to view harassment as acceptable. But there's a great deal at stake in how we assess these new boundaries—for women and men together. We can and should police criminal acts and discourage inappropriate, destructive behavior.

At least we've started asking the right questions. Ones that seem alarmingly basic in hindsight: ""What if we did complain?"" proposes Megyn Kelly. ""What if we didn't whine, but we spoke our truth in our strongest voices and insisted that those around us did better? What if that worked to change reality right now?"" Kelly acknowledges that this still feels more like a promise than a certainty. But for the moment, the world is listening.

Biden forced Democrats to revisit the # MeToo issue over the weekend as one of their own made it clear that she is unwilling to stay quiet for the good of the team .
Former Nevada state Assemblywoman Lucy Flores accused Mr. Biden , the putative front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination , in an op-ed article over the weekend of putting his hands on her shoulders , smelling her hair and planting a kiss on the back of her head during her 2014 campaign rally for lieutenant governor .
On Sunday , Ms. Flores described the incident , which Mr. Biden had said he did not recall , as “ disqualifying , ” given what she called his history of “ acting inappropriately with women ” and a political climate in which young Democratic “ foot soldiers ” like herself are no longer willing to “ keep our mouths shut . ”
“ We ’ re often pressured to keep our mouths shut about anything , ” Ms. Flores told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union. ” “ We , as party loyalists , as party stalwarts , are foot soldiers for the party . We ’ re expected to , quote-unquote , keep our dirty laundry to ourselves . And it ’ s always in service to the party . ”
Mr. Biden , who has yet to declare his candidacy , responded by vowing to “ remain the strongest advocate I can be ” for women . The Biden camp posted multiple declarations of support from former female staffers and colleagues who vouched for his character .
“ In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life , I have offered countless handshakes , hugs , expressions of affection , support and comfort , and not once , never , did I believe I acted inappropriately , ” Mr. Biden said . “ If it is suggested I did so , I will listen respectfully , but it was never my intention . ”

At the same time , the accusation raised questions about whether the 76-year-old Delaware Democrat ’ s physical , press-the-flesh campaign style may become a liability in the # MeToo era .
“ Joe Biden is a longtime American political figure who came from the fleshy world of ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s politics , when everybody started to hug and kiss , ” former Reagan White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ It was different from the ‘ 40s and ‘ 50s . We ’ re hugging . We ’ re kissing . All that stuff is going on . That ’ s part of his story right now . ”
Well before the Flores accusation , Mr. Biden had gained a reputation for his close encounters with women , such as a 2015 episode in which he rested his hands on the shoulders of Stephanie Carter , wife of then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter , and then whispered into her ear .
Some of the encounters appeared friendly , others uncomfortable . White House counselor Kellyanne Conway pointed to a “ treasure trove ” of “ creepy Uncle Joe videos ” on the internet .
“ I think Joe has a big problem here because he calls it an affectionate handshake , his party calls it completely inappropriate , ” Mrs. Conway said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Of course , Mr. Trump has his own problems on that score . He has denied accusations that he engaged in unwanted touching or kissing with more than a dozen women , buttressed by his bragging on tape about being able to grab women by the genitals . But the hypocrisy risk is higher for Democrats , given their calls to “ believe women . ”
Ms. Flores agreed that the timing of her op-ed was political , spurred by Mr. Biden ’ s anticipated candidacy . She acknowledged that she supported Sen. Bernard Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and attended former Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke ’ s campaign kickoff Saturday in El Paso , Texas .
Asked about Mr. Biden ’ s statement , Ms. Flores said , “ I ’ m glad that he ’ s willing to listen . I ’ m glad that he is clarifying his intentions , ” but “ my point was never about his intentions .
“ And they shouldn ’ t be about his intentions , ” Ms. Flores said . “ It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior . And this isn ’ t the first time , and it wasn ’ t the only incident where he was acting inappropriately with women . ”
She emphasized that “ never do I claim that this rises to the level of a sexual assault or anything of that nature . ”
“ What I am saying is that it ’ s completely inappropriate , that it does not belong in any kind of a professional setting , much less in politics , ” Ms. Flores said . “ That is something that we should consider when we are talking about the background of a person who is considering running for president . ”
Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates reacted over the weekend by saying they believed Ms. Flores — or had no reason not to — and that only Mr. Biden could decide whether the allegation was “ disqualifying . ”
“ I read the op-ed last night . I believe Lucy Flores , and Joe Biden needs to give an answer , ” Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat , said at the Heartland Forum in Iowa .
Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro , who was also at the Iowa forum , said , “ I believe Lucy Flores . I believe the vice president put a statement out today . He ’ s going to decide whether he ’ s going to run or not , and then the American people , if he does , will decide whether they support him or not . ”
On Capitol Hill , Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , said he didn ’ t believe that a single accusation of inappropriate behavior should be enough to keep Mr. Biden out of the 2020 presidential race , where he leads the crowded field of would-be nominees in virtually every poll .
“ Certainly one allegation is not disqualifying , but it should be taken seriously , ” Mr. Durbin said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press . ”
A Quinnipiac University poll released Friday found Mr. Biden , who served two terms as President Barack Obama ’ s vice president , with the support of 29 percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters , followed by Mr. Sanders , at 19 percent .
Mr. Sanders questioned whether Mr. Biden should be ruled out as a candidate based on one allegation .
“ I think that ’ s a decision for the vice president to make , ” Mr. Sanders said on CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation. ” “ I ’ m not sure that one incident alone disqualifies anybody , but her point is absolutely right . This is an issue not just for Democrats or Republicans . The entire country has got to take this seriously .
Political strategist Cornell Belcher , a former Democratic Party pollster , said he was confident that Mr. Biden ’ s potential candidacy would survive the accusation , which appeared Friday in an essay by Ms. Flores in New York magazine called “ An Awkward Kiss Changed How I Saw Joe Biden . ”
“ The culture has fundamentally changed , which is a problem for a lot of our older candidates , who , to your point , came up in a culture that was very different , ” Mr. Belcher said on “ Meet the Press. ” “ But I think he can survive it . And this is why he survives it : comfort . … Democrats are very , very comfortable with Joe Biden . ”","A former lawmaker’s accusation of unwanted touching by former Vice President Joseph R.

Jennifer Araoz , 32 , said in her complaint that she was starting out in high school when an Epstein associate brought her to the financier 's massive mansion on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , beginning a grooming process that led to months of sexual abuse , including what she called a `` brutal rape . ''
The lawsuit in New York County Supreme Court is among the first of a series by women made possible by the state 's Child Victims Act , which opened a one-year window to sue over alleged sexual abuse regardless of how long ago it occurred .
Epstein , who once counted Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic former President Bill Clinton as friends , died at age 66 on Saturday of an apparent suicide .
He had been found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan , after having apparently hanged himself , prison authorities said .
Epstein had been arrested on July 6 and pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls between 2002 and 2005 . Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages , which became sexual in nature .

The complaint described Epstein 's massage room as having a ceiling painted as a blue sky with clouds and angels , `` to give the appearance that you were in heaven . ''
It also detailed a variety of alleged misconduct by Epstein , including what she called an insinuation that she owed him because of the money he paid her .
`` I take care of you , you take care of me , '' the complaint quoted Epstein as saying .
Araoz also accused Epstein of having failed to use a condom during the alleged rape , which she said led her to suffer a `` panic disorder '' that was exacerbated by her father 's recent death from AIDS .
The other three unnamed defendants in Araoz 's lawsuit , all women who allegedly worked for Epstein in New York , include a maid , a secretary , and a `` recruiter '' who helped procure underage girls for him .
Dan Kaiser , a lawyer for Araoz , said on the conference call that holding Epstein 's `` adult enablers '' responsible was `` a very large part of this story . ''
He called Maxwell a key figure in maintaining and concealing Epstein 's alleged sex trafficking ring , although Araoz never met her .
`` She is absolutely culpable for the injuries that these girls sustained , '' Kaiser said , referring to Maxwell .
To obtain damages in civil lawsuits against Epstein 's estate , victims would need to prove claims by a preponderance of the evidence , not beyond a reasonable doubt as in a criminal case .

LENIENT 2008 SETTLEMENT

In 2008, Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor in a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors that has been widely criticized as too lenient.

The U.S. Attorney in Miami at the time, Alexander Acosta, resigned as U.S. labor secretary in July as that agreement came under fresh scrutiny following Epstein's latest arrest.

Epstein had been on suicide watch since the arrest but a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was not on watch at the time of his death.

U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday ordered the transfer of Epstein's jail warden, after condemning ""serious irregularities"" at the facility. Two guards were placed on leave.

Barr also said the criminal investigation into Epstein's alleged sex trafficking and the role of possible co-conspirators would continue.

Trump has called for an investigation into Epstein's death. FBI agents were expected to visit the Manhattan jail on Wednesday, MSNBC said.

It is not known if Epstein had a will. His lawyers last month said Epstein had about $559 million of assets, including two private islands and four homes, and that the Manhattan mansion was worth about $77 million.

sexual_misconduct,Fox News (Online),2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-columbia-faculty-kavanaugh-tara-reade,"As Biden gives commencement address, Columbia Law faculty who opposed Kavanaugh downplay Tara Reade accusations",,Gregg Re,"Columbia Law School was essentially united in opposition to Brett Kavanaugh 's Supreme Court confirmation in 2018 -- as the university established a new , mandatory sexual misconduct education initiative , dozens of faculty members signed a petition in The New York Times saying the nominee 's `` temperament '' alone was disqualifying , and students staged round-the-clock protests .
Now , as Joe Biden prepares to deliver a virtual commencement address at Columbia Law School on Wednesday , he also stands accused of sexual assault ( which he , too , adamantly denies ) along with previously reported incidents of inappropriate touching . The once-vocal advocates for women 's rights and the `` Me Too '' movement at New York City 's only Ivy League law school , though , have a starkly different view toward Biden .
TIMELINE SHOWS MEDIA , DEMS HANDLED BIDEN CASE VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM KAVANAUGH ACCUSATION
Instead , the Columbia Law School 's dean , Gillian Lester , issued a statement praising Biden for setting an `` example '' as a `` leader , lawyer , and public servant . '' Asked to explain the change in tone on campus , the law school 's press office declined to comment to Fox News .
However , in one-on-one interviews with Fox News , several Columbia Law School faculty members made clear the topic was a sensitive one -- and that they had no intention of criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee .
Avery W. Katz , formerly a vice dean at the law school whom Columbia currently bills as a `` Professor of Organizational Character , '' lashed out when Fox News pointed out that he signed the open letter in the Times calling for Kavanaugh 's nomination to be pulled in 2018 amid sexual assault allegations . Asked whether he would object to Biden 's appearance at the university , Katz responded that the question `` did n't sound like a genuine inquiry '' and seemed `` argumentative . ''
Katz then separately emailed two senior Fox News executives to complain that the request for comment he received , as well as one clarifying email , amounted to `` multiple trolling messages ... under the pretext of a journalistic inquiry . ''
Katz added that he would block Fox News from contacting him : `` I 'm going to add [ Fox News ] to my spam filter after sending this message . ''
Bernard E. Harcourt , who was quoted in The Washington Post as one of the organizers of the open letter opposing Kavanaugh in 2018 , said at the time that professors were grappling “ with great distress '' due to `` the unprecedented and unfathomable demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh '' during his Senate confirmation hearing . Harcourt did n't respond to Fox News ' request for comment Tuesday as to whether he felt similar distress concerning Biden 's commencement speech .
Meanwhile , Jeffrey Fagan , a Columbia Law School criminal law professor who also signed the open letter , told Fox News : `` My opposition to Kavanaugh was based on his temperament , '' rather than Christine Blasey Ford 's accusation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school .
Kavanaugh at the time accused senators of seeking to `` destroy '' him and his family using unsubstantiated allegations . He also charged that some were seeking `` revenge on behalf of the Clintons , '' in reference to his previous work on the Bill Clinton impeachment trial . At one point , asked by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar if he had a drinking problem , Kavanaugh immediately asked Klobuchar the same question .
Pressed on the apparent focus that many student groups at Columbia Law School had on Kavanaugh 's alleged sexual misconduct in 2018 , rather than simply his temperament , Fagan asserted that coronavirus might help explain why the law school was n't up in arms over the sexual assault allegation against Biden .
`` I suspect that since most of the students have been gone since mid-March , and their minds have been focused on figuring out how to study for finals during lockdown , and because the 3Ls are worried about whether their job offers are still good , the Biden issues are n't foremost on their minds , '' Fagan said .
Other faculty members went a step further . Jeffrey Gordon , a capital markets and corporate governance professor , told Fox News in an email that he simply did not believe Tara Reade , the former Biden staffer who says her old boss penetrated her without consent in 1993 . Gordon added that Ford 's accusations were not the main reason he opposed Kavanaugh .
`` My opposition to Judge Kavanaugh 's confirmation was not based on the allegations by Dr. Ford , per se , '' Gordon began , `` but rather on : ( 1 ) the lack of judicial temperament appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice as revealed by ( i ) his arrogant , self-pitying , partisan , and disrespectful testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and ( ii ) his history as a partisan warrier [ sic ] in the Special Counsel investigation of Pres Clinton and in the Bush White House , and ( 2 ) my belief that his ideological commitments were outside the judicial mainstream . ''
`` I disbelieve the Tara Reade allegations in light of extensive reporting by Vox , Politico , PBS and others , '' Gordon continued , linking to a Jonathan Chait piece . Chait cites inconsistencies in Reade 's story , as well as reports that some witnesses were instructed to mislead .
Similar concerns were raised in Ford 's case at the time . Gordon told Fox News , however , that he `` tended to believe Ford 's allegations . ''
Andrzej Rapaczynski , a trusts and estates professor at Columbia Law School , told Fox News that although he is `` one of very few Republicans on Columbia law faculty , '' he has `` no intention to participate in any protests against Joe Biden in this matter . ''
He said his objection to Kavanaugh was `` based on the fact that his behavior at the confirmation hearings , especially his entirely inappropriate politicization of the hearings and his baseless claims about their origins in the Clinton camp , showed crude political partisanship and a complete lack of judicial temperament . ''
Associate Professor Joshua Mitts , who teaches corporate and securities law , echoed his colleague 's concerns about Kavanaugh 's temperament during his Senate confirmation hearings .
`` I do n't see evidence of Joe Biden acting that way , '' Mitts said . He quoted from the letter he signed , along with nearly 2,000 other law professors and 44 Columbia Law School faculty members , citing Kavanaugh 's `` aggressive , '' `` discourteous , '' and `` partisan '' demeanor .
`` I do n't see a lack of commitment to judicious inquiry , and I 'm not going to pretend to be an expert in all the nuances of what Joe Biden has said or done , but what I 've seen in the news is that he has called for transparency , I believe he 's called for records to be released , '' Mitts continued . `` He , in my opinion , has not responded to these allegations in the way that Judge Kavanaugh did . ''
When Fox News pointed out that Biden has not authorized the University of Delaware to release his Senate records , but instead has only sought records from the Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Senate , Mitts said he was n't sure on the details but emphasized that he is a `` huge advocate for transparency . ''
Earlier this month , an attorney for Reade urged the Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Senate to `` reconsider '' its decision not to release personnel records due to `` confidentiality '' concerns -- and called on Biden to voluntarily turn over the large collection of his Senate papers , currently housed on friendly territory at the University of Delaware . The attorney , Douglas Wigdor , authored a Medium post announcing that he had sent a letter specifically urging the Senate to turn over a complaint he says Reade filed in 1993 with the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices , concerning the alleged harassment she experienced in Biden 's office . Biden has maintained that the records held at the university are not relevant to personnel matters .

As students prepared to virtually graduate on Wednesday , with Biden delivering the commencement address , there was one point of broad agreement among the faculty : It was time to celebrate .
`` It 's a real testament to our students that they have persevered and done tremendous work under these challenging circumstances , '' Mitts said , and `` we 're all going to be very excited to celebrate with them . ''","Columbia Law School was essentially united in opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation in 2018 -- as the university established a new, mandatory sexual misconduct education initiative, dozens of faculty members signed a petition in The New York Times saying the nominee's ""temperament"" alone was disqualifying, and students staged round-the-clock protests.

Now, as Joe Biden prepares to deliver a virtual commencement address at Columbia Law School on Wednesday, he also stands accused of sexual assault (which he, too, adamantly denies) along with previously reported incidents of inappropriate touching. The once-vocal advocates for women's rights and the ""Me Too"" movement at New York City's only Ivy League law school, though, have a starkly different view toward Biden.

TIMELINE SHOWS MEDIA, DEMS HANDLED BIDEN CASE VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM KAVANAUGH ACCUSATION

Instead, the Columbia Law School's dean, Gillian Lester, issued a statement praising Biden for setting an ""example"" as a ""leader, lawyer, and public servant."" Asked to explain the change in tone on campus, the law school's press office declined to comment to Fox News.

However, in one-on-one interviews with Fox News, several Columbia Law School faculty members made clear the topic was a sensitive one -- and that they had no intention of criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

Avery W. Katz, formerly a vice dean at the law school whom Columbia currently bills as a ""Professor of Organizational Character,"" lashed out when Fox News pointed out that he signed the open letter in the Times calling for Kavanaugh's nomination to be pulled in 2018 amid sexual assault allegations. Asked whether he would object to Biden's appearance at the university, Katz responded that the question ""didn't sound like a genuine inquiry"" and seemed ""argumentative.""

Katz then separately emailed two senior Fox News executives to complain that the request for comment he received, as well as one clarifying email, amounted to ""multiple trolling messages ... under the pretext of a journalistic inquiry.""

Katz added that he would block Fox News from contacting him: ""I'm going to add [Fox News] to my spam filter after sending this message.""

Bernard E. Harcourt, who was quoted in The Washington Post as one of the organizers of the open letter opposing Kavanaugh in 2018, said at the time that professors were grappling “with great distress"" due to ""the unprecedented and unfathomable demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh"" during his Senate confirmation hearing. Harcourt didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment Tuesday as to whether he felt similar distress concerning Biden's commencement speech.

Meanwhile, Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia Law School criminal law professor who also signed the open letter, told Fox News: ""My opposition to Kavanaugh was based on his temperament,"" rather than Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school.

Kavanaugh at the time accused senators of seeking to ""destroy"" him and his family using unsubstantiated allegations. He also charged that some were seeking ""revenge on behalf of the Clintons,"" in reference to his previous work on the Bill Clinton impeachment trial. At one point, asked by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar if he had a drinking problem, Kavanaugh immediately asked Klobuchar the same question.

Pressed on the apparent focus that many student groups at Columbia Law School had on Kavanaugh's alleged sexual misconduct in 2018, rather than simply his temperament, Fagan asserted that coronavirus might help explain why the law school wasn't up in arms over the sexual assault allegation against Biden.

""I suspect that since most of the students have been gone since mid-March, and their minds have been focused on figuring out how to study for finals during lockdown, and because the 3Ls are worried about whether their job offers are still good, the Biden issues aren't foremost on their minds,"" Fagan said.

Other faculty members went a step further. Jeffrey Gordon, a capital markets and corporate governance professor, told Fox News in an email that he simply did not believe Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer who says her old boss penetrated her without consent in 1993. Gordon added that Ford's accusations were not the main reason he opposed Kavanaugh.

""My opposition to Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation was not based on the allegations by Dr. Ford, per se,"" Gordon began, ""but rather on: (1) the lack of judicial temperament appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice as revealed by (i) his arrogant, self-pitying, partisan, and disrespectful testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and (ii) his history as a partisan warrier [sic] in the Special Counsel investigation of Pres Clinton and in the Bush White House, and (2) my belief that his ideological commitments were outside the judicial mainstream.""

""I disbelieve the Tara Reade allegations in light of extensive reporting by Vox, Politico, PBS and others,"" Gordon continued, linking to a Jonathan Chait piece. Chait cites inconsistencies in Reade's story, as well as reports that some witnesses were instructed to mislead.

Similar concerns were raised in Ford's case at the time. Gordon told Fox News, however, that he ""tended to believe Ford's allegations.""

HOW THE TARA READE EVIDENCE COMPARES TO CHRISTINE FORD'S

Andrzej Rapaczynski, a trusts and estates professor at Columbia Law School, told Fox News that although he is ""one of very few Republicans on Columbia law faculty,"" he has ""no intention to participate in any protests against Joe Biden in this matter.""

He said his objection to Kavanaugh was ""based on the fact that his behavior at the confirmation hearings, especially his entirely inappropriate politicization of the hearings and his baseless claims about their origins in the Clinton camp, showed crude political partisanship and a complete lack of judicial temperament.""

Associate Professor Joshua Mitts, who teaches corporate and securities law, echoed his colleague's concerns about Kavanaugh's temperament during his Senate confirmation hearings.

""I don't see evidence of Joe Biden acting that way,"" Mitts said. He quoted from the letter he signed, along with nearly 2,000 other law professors and 44 Columbia Law School faculty members, citing Kavanaugh's ""aggressive,"" ""discourteous,"" and ""partisan"" demeanor.

""I don't see a lack of commitment to judicious inquiry, and I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in all the nuances of what Joe Biden has said or done, but what I've seen in the news is that he has called for transparency, I believe he's called for records to be released,"" Mitts continued. ""He, in my opinion, has not responded to these allegations in the way that Judge Kavanaugh did.""

When Fox News pointed out that Biden has not authorized the University of Delaware to release his Senate records, but instead has only sought records from the Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Senate, Mitts said he wasn't sure on the details but emphasized that he is a ""huge advocate for transparency.""

Earlier this month, an attorney for Reade urged the Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Senate to ""reconsider"" its decision not to release personnel records due to ""confidentiality"" concerns -- and called on Biden to voluntarily turn over the large collection of his Senate papers, currently housed on friendly territory at the University of Delaware. The attorney, Douglas Wigdor, authored a Medium post announcing that he had sent a letter specifically urging the Senate to turn over a complaint he says Reade filed in 1993 with the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, concerning the alleged harassment she experienced in Biden's office. Biden has maintained that the records held at the university are not relevant to personnel matters.

""I'm not following this as closely as you are,"" Mitts said. ""But I will say in general -- and I think what I'm saying is probably a sentiment shared not just by my colleagues, but by law professors around the country -- is we certainly want the truth to come to light. One of the fundamental values of our legal system is due process and care and consideration and evaluation of the evidence.""

NORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Comedian Bill Cosby was convicted on Thursday of drugging and sexually assaulting a onetime friend in 2004, marking the first such conviction of a celebrity since the #MeToo movement that has brought down rich and powerful men for their treatment of women.

Cosby, 80, best known as the lovable father from the 1980s TV hit “The Cosby Show,” faces up to 10 years in prison for each of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand, 45, following a three-week trial at the Montgomery County courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania.

After maintaining decorum throughout the trial, Cosby exploded following the verdict when prosecutors asked the judge to take him into custody, saying he was a flight risk in part because he owned a plane.

“He doesn’t have a plane, you asshole!” Cosby responded in a booming voice as he leapt to feet.

District Attorney Kevin Steele later remarked that with the outburst, “You got to see who he really was.”

As the verdict was read, Cosby looked down with a sad expression. Lili Bernard, one of his many accusers, began sobbing. Constand sat stone-faced.

Judge Steven O’Neill ruled Cosby could remain out of jail on $1 million bail pending sentencing at a later date, as long as he surrendered his passport and remained at home.

Cosby then left the courthouse with his lawyers and publicist.

“The fight will go on,” defense lawyer Thomas Mesereau told reporters, adding he would appeal the conviction.

Sentencing was expected within 60 to 90 days, after Cosby submits to a “sexually violent predator assessment.”

Although he could get up to 10 years for each count, state sentencing guidelines suggest a term of less than 10 years.

The conviction marks the downfall of a man once celebrated as “America’s Dad” but whose reputation was ruined after some 50 women accused him of similar offenses going back decades.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Tara Reade , the former Senate staffer who alleges Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago , says she filed a limited report with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual assault or harassment .
“ I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable , ” Reade said in an interview Friday with The ███ . “ I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault . ”

She said : “ I talked about sexual harassment , retaliation . The main word I used – and I know I didn ’ t use sexual harassment — I used ‘ uncomfortable. ’ And I remember ‘ retaliation . ’ ”
Reade described the report after the AP discovered additional transcripts and notes from its interviews with Reade last year in which she says she “ chickened out ” after going to the Senate personnel office .

She did not raise allegations of sexual assault against Biden until this year , around the time he became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee .
The existence of the Senate report has become a key element of the accusations against Biden , which he has flatly denied . Reade says she doesn ’ t have a copy of the report , and Biden said Friday that he is not aware that any complaint against him exists . He asked the Senate and the National Archives to search their records to try to locate a complaint from Reade .

On Friday , Reade said she was referring to having “ chickened out ” by not filing full harassment or assault allegations against Biden . In multiple interviews with the AP on Friday , Reade insisted she filed an “ intake form ” at the Senate personnel office , which included her contact information , the office she worked for and some broad details of her issues with Biden .

The woman who accuses US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has been given extra time to decide whether she will testify against him at a confirmation hearing.

Allegations from a university professor, Christine Blasey Ford, emerged in the US media last week.

She gave details of an incident which she says happened at a party in 1982.

Her lawyer has accused Republicans of trying to ""bully"" her with ""arbitrary"" and ""aggressive"" deadlines.

The Friday deadline given by the Senate judiciary committee is now reported to have been switched to later on Saturday.

President Donald Trump attacked Prof Ford's credibility on Friday, saying if the attack had been ""as bad as she says"", she would have reported it to the authorities sooner.

Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Why the change in deadline?

Prof Ford insists she is ready to testify at the hearing, but negotiations over certain conditions she has set out, including it not taking place until next Thursday, have delayed proceedings.

The committee originally granted her a deadline of 22:00 on Friday (02:00 GMT Saturday) to agree to revised terms - though it is not yet known what these are.

But the professor's lawyer, Debra Katz, demanded another day to decide, saying: ""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family.""

In response, Senator Chuck Grassley - the lead Republican on the committee - said he had granted Prof Ford ""another extension"" - which, according to the New York Times, runs until 14:30 on Saturday (18:30 GMT).

How did the allegations come to light?

The allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's pick for the US top court, became public last week.

It emerged Prof Ford had detailed the alleged assault in a confidential letter to the top Democratic senator on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, in July.

As the judge neared confirmation, news about the letter leaked to US media. Ms Feinstein then confirmed she had passed it onto the FBI.

After days of continued media speculation, Prof Ford went on record in a Washington Post article as the mystery accuser, detailing the alleged assault.

She said Mr Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing at a party, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth when she was 15 and he was 17.

Since then, her lawyers have been in a back-and-forth with the judicial committee, trying to agree on terms for her to testify.

Why is the hearing important?

The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life.

As Mr Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh has to first be approved by the Senate before he can take his seat - but before that vote can happen, he has to be approved by the judiciary committee, where Prof Ford may testify.

The Senate is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats - so any testimony she gives on the allegations could prove pivotal.

Some have said there should not be a vote on his confirmation until Prof Ford has been heard.

What has Mr Trump said?

President Trump weighed in heavily on the allegations on social media on Friday.

In a series of tweets, he questioned why law enforcement was not called at the time of the alleged assault, in 1982.

He also reiterated his full support for Judge Kavanaugh who he described as a ""fine man, with an impeccable reputation"".

Mr Trump's controversial comments were criticised by Democratic politicians and some Republicans.

Republican Senator Susan Collins said she was ""appalled"" by Mr Trump's tweet.

""We know that allegations of sexual assault - I'm not saying that's what happened in this case - but we know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,"" she told reporters.

Only 23% of rapes and sexual assaults are reported to the police, according to the Department of Justice's 2016 report.

Kirsten Gillibrand from 2011 until last week , serving as her driver and military adviser . He was accused of sexual harassment by a former Gillibrand staffer . | Staten Island Advance/SILive.com 2020 Elections Former Gillibrand aide resigned in protest over handling of sex harassment claims What happened when # MeToo hit the office of one of its leaders , 2020 candidate Kirsten Gillibrand .
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) , one of the most outspoken advocates of the # MeToo movement who has made fighting sexual misconduct a centerpiece of her presidential campaign , spent last summer pressing legislators to update Congress ’ “ broken ” system of handling sexual harassment .
At the same time , a mid-20s female aide to Gillibrand resigned in protest over the handling of her sexual harassment complaint by Gillibrand ‘ s office , and criticized the senator for failing to abide by her own public standards .
In July , the female staffer alleged one of Gillibrand ’ s closest aides — who was a decade her senior and married — repeatedly made unwelcome advances after the senator had told him he would be promoted to a supervisory role over her . She also said the male aide regularly made crude , misogynistic remarks in the office about his female colleagues and potential female hires .
Less than three weeks after reporting the alleged harassment and subsequently claiming that the man retaliated against her for doing so , the woman told chief of staff Jess Fassler that she was resigning because of the office ’ s handling of the matter . She did not have another job lined up .
The woman was granted anonymity because she fears retaliation and damage to her future professional prospects .
“ I have offered my resignation because of how poorly the investigation and post-investigation was handled , ” the woman wrote to Gillibrand in a letter sent on her final day to the senator 's personal email account . Copied were general counsel Keith Castaldo and Fassler , who is now managing the senator ’ s presidential bid .
“ I trusted and leaned on this statement that you made : ‘ You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K . None of it is acceptable. ’ Your office chose to go against your public belief that women shouldn ’ t accept sexual harassment in any form and portrayed my experience as a misinterpretation instead of what it actually was : harassment and ultimately , intimidation , ” the woman wrote .
The senator and her staff never responded to the letter .
Gillibrand , who was not made available for an interview , issued a statement to ███ defending her office ’ s handling of the incident .
“ These are challenges that affect all of our nation ’ s workplaces , including mine , and the question is whether or not they are taken seriously . As I have long said , when allegations are made in the workplace , we must believe women so that serious investigations can actually take place , we can learn the facts , and there can be appropriate accountability , ” she said . “ That ’ s exactly what happened at every step of this case last year . I told her that we loved her at the time and the same is true today . ”
Her office said no one responded to the letter because it determined that “ engaging again on an already settled personnel matter was not the appropriate course of action. ” It said the letter came after she ’ d given three weeks ’ notice , “ contained clear inaccuracies and was a major departure from the sentiments she shared with senior staff in her final days in the office . ”
Since she left last summer , the woman has been doing part-time contract work . The male aide , Abbas Malik , kept his job .
Two weeks ago , however , ███ presented the office with its own findings of additional allegations of inappropriate workplace conduct by Malik . Among the claims were that he made a “ joke ” about rape to a female colleague — a person whom the office had failed to contact last summer despite repeated urgings by Malik ’ s accuser to reach out to the person .
Gillibrand ’ s office opened a new investigation and dismissed Malik last week . Malik did not respond to requests for comment .
The episode suggests a disconnect between the senator ’ s categorical public stance and her office ’ s private actions . It also points to broader problems with sexual harassment investigations on Capitol Hill : They are usually conducted internally by top aides with pre-existing relationships in the office rather than by an independent third party — a structure that Gillibrand has criticized in other institutions such as the military . The system can leave Capitol Hill aides ill-served , since those involved in an investigation have a motivation to protect the lawmaker .
And the case highlights the challenges of responding to alleged sexual harassment when it hits home , even for a leader on the issue . Malik had spent years by Gillibrand ’ s side as her driver — the senator officiated at his wedding — while the woman was a more recent hire and had significantly less stature in the office . He was accused not of physical harassment but of making unwanted advances and using demeaning language — behavior that can be easier to downplay and can require a higher level of diligence to get to the bottom of .
Gillibrand ’ s advisers said they took the woman ’ s claims seriously , consulted with Senate employment lawyers for guidance and punished Malik at the time for what they could substantiate . But after “ a full and thorough investigation into the evidence , including multiple interviews with current employees who could have witnessed this behavior , the office concluded that the allegations did not meet the standard of sexual harassment , ” the office said of its initial internal investigation .
That inquiry , however , left out key former staffers . The aides who led it — deputy chief of staff Anne Bradley and Castaldo — did not contact two former employees whom the woman said could corroborate and add to her allegations of inappropriate workplace conduct . Gillibrand ’ s office interviewed only current employees .
“ Anyone doing a thorough investigation would contact any witness that had or was likely to have relevant information , particularly when there is a hostile working environment alleged , ” said Les Alderman , an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment in the workplace and represented an alleged victim in a case against former Rep. Blake Farenthold ( R-Texas ) that garnered national attention last year . “ The idea that an employer is somehow restricted from contacting former employees who could shed light on the situation is laughable . ”
███ reached out to more than 20 former Gillibrand staffers to see if there was a pattern of behavior by Malik , including the two aides the woman specifically asked the office to contact .
One of those two former staffers said Malik often called her fat and unattractive to her face and made light of sexual abuse . She recalled one instance in which Malik remarked that a particular woman they were talking about “ couldn ’ t get laid unless she was raped. ” The person did not report that behavior at the time but now says she wishes she had .
Two more staffers who worked for Gillibrand said the woman ’ s claims of Malik ’ s inappropriate workplace behavior matched their own experiences . They said Malik regularly made misogynistic jokes , frequently appraised what they wore , disparaged the looks of other female staffers and rated the attractiveness of women who came in for interviews .
The office also dispensed with the allegations of Malik ‘ s retaliation without informing the woman of its conclusions or any disciplinary action .
Gillibrand ’ s office acknowledged it found evidence that Malik had made unspecified inappropriate comments and revoked his expected promotion , which would have come with a raise . It also moved his desk and gave him a final warning . This was not the first time the senator ’ s top aides dealt with an allegation of bad behavior by Malik : According to a firsthand witness of an incident in 2015 , Malik confronted a fellow aide in the office . He got in the man ’ s face , pushed his desk and threatened to “ fucking ” hurt him , the witness said , describing the confrontation as “ violent . ”
But Fassler and Bradley told the woman that her claim of inappropriate advances was a case of “ misinterpretation ” and too much of a “ he said , she said ” to warrant Malik ‘ s dismissal , according to contemporaneous notes taken by the woman .
The office did not deny those terms were used but disputed that characterization of the investigation . “ This case was never viewed as ‘ he said , she said. ’ Upon conclusion of the full and thorough investigation , it was determined that the evidence revealed employee misconduct that , while inappropriate , did not constitute sexual harassment , ” the office said .
“ When I had the courage to speak up about my harasser , I was belittled by her office and treated like an inconvenience , ” the woman said of Gillibrand in an interview . “ She kept a harasser on her staff until it proved politically untenable for her to do so . ”
As part of her freelance work for an events production firm , she staffed the kickoff rally for one of Gillibrand ’ s rivals in the Democratic presidential primary . She has not done any other work for that or other presidential campaigns , and is not interviewing with any 2020 contenders .
Malik became Gillibrand ’ s driver in 2011 after serving two tours in the Iraq War . He became such a constant presence in Gillibrand ’ s life — he had a set of keys to her home and often drove her children to school with her — that some staffers dubbed him “ the keeper of her purse. ” The office changed his title to “ military adviser ” in 2015 despite his responsibilities remaining largely the same .
Though she said she was put off by Malik ’ s comments about other female aides , the woman said her dealings with him had been generally cordial . But that changed when Gillibrand told him on July 10 , 2018 , that she wanted him to direct advance work for her future trips . All the details of the new job hadn ’ t been settled , but Abbas told the woman that he would be “ in charge ” of her position , she said .
“ I have treated [ A ] bbas the same the entire year I have worked here , ” the woman wrote in a detailed timeline of events that she later sent to Bradley , the deputy chief of staff . “ It wasn ’ t until after this ‘ promotion ’ that he decided to hit on me . ”
According to that timeline and documentation sent to Gillibrand ’ s office at the time , the alleged harassment started almost immediately after word of the planned promotion , with increasingly aggressive advances . In one late-night text message , Malik told her he now understood the meaning of the clown emoji — it meant “ down to clown , ” an innuendo for having sex from the movie “ Blockers , ” he elaborated the next morning .
On one day alone , July 13 , she said Malik made four unwanted advances , which were all rebuffed . The first occurred alone in the office early in the morning when Malik told the woman he had a secret for her : Her boss had just quit .
“ Ugh I shouldn ’ t have told you . You are totally going to tell people , ” he said , according to her notes . “ Why do I love you ! I should hate you ! ”
After Malik prodded her for a secret of her own , she said Malik walked up to her desk and asked , “ If we had met in a bar would it have happened for us ? ”
And at a birthday party for another staffer that evening , Malik told her privately that “ I thought by debrief you meant you were hitting on me , ” referencing an earlier text message .
She asked him if he was kidding . “ No , I ’ m not kidding , ” he responded . “ [ O ] h wow ok no I was absolutely not hitting on you , ” she replied , according to her timeline . He pressed two more times , prompting the woman to chide him in a text : “ You ’ re married ! ! ” He still sent a string of flirtatious texts later , including one with a clown emoji .
The woman said she tried to stay away from Malik the following week . But he began complaining that she was being mean to him because of his expected promotion , and said that he would give her the silent treatment until she apologized . “ This seriously was so upsetting to me because I was not upset about that . I was upset with him sexually harassing me and he is trying to create his own narrative , ” she wrote in her timeline .
On July 25 , the woman emailed Bradley her detailed recollection of events , which she had written over the previous week . In addition to the advances , the woman claimed that Malik “ said derogatory and inappropriate things about women since I started here. ” She alleged that Malik called a female colleague “ fat ” and “ ugly , ” would rate the appearance of potential hires , and told colleagues that the office ’ s new fellow — essentially a young female intern — “ wanted him . ”
Bradley immediately looped in Fassler , who called the woman . They both assured her they were taking the accusations seriously . Bradley and Castaldo , the general counsel , immediately went to the Senate ’ s employment counsel and consulted with it throughout the process , a routine step for Senate offices when confronted with sexual harassment complaints to protect them from liability .
Though it ’ s common in Congress for top aides to investigate alleged harassment by another office employee , experts in sexual harassment law said the arrangement is inherently unfair to the complainant . Ideally , an independent third party should look into such claims given that staff members have pre-existing relationships that often pose a conflict of interest , they said .
Gillibrand ’ s office said it had previously explored hiring outside investigators but determined it was `` not a realistic or viable option . '' However , experts said several House offices have taken that step .
“ There have been instances when offices have sought out an objective third party to conduct the investigation and that seems to be a method that increases fairness for all parties concerned , ” said Kristin Nicholson , a former longtime chief of staff on the Hill and co-founder of Congress Too , an organization of former congressional staffers committed to combating sexual harassment in Congress .
Gillibrand herself has made the case for a similar setup for the military , pushing legislation that would have independent prosecutors — rather than commanders — handle allegations of sexual misconduct in the military .
The main mechanism for the woman to bring a complaint outside the Senate office would have been through the Office of Compliance . She visited that office before going to her superiors but found it unhelpful , saying a staffer merely recited language from its website . She also knew that in order to file a complaint she would first have to go through at least 30 days of mediation and likely more . Last year , Gillibrand called that a “ daunting requirement , ” while pushing to reform the compliance office .
So the woman turned to Gillibrand ’ s aides . In addition to the senator ’ s public stance on the issue , the office had required staffers to undergo three training sessions the previous year on sexual harassment prevention , including one in early July .
When she learned on July 30 that the office had disciplined but not fired Malik , the woman was upset . But at the time , she trusted that the office did all it could . “ I felt satisfied there had been a fair process , ” she recounted in her resignation letter .
That appraisal , however , began to change the next morning when Bradley entered the woman ’ s office and told her that Malik was upset . “ Wouldn ’ t you be ? ” Bradley said , according to notes of the conversation the woman emailed to herself immediately afterward .
The woman said Malik should be feeling remorseful . But Bradley said Malik felt that losing his potential promotion was too harsh a punishment . She also said Fassler , the chief of staff , had said Malik was “ lucky ” because the office could have fired him for many reasons .
A few hours later , the woman met with Bradley in Gillibrand ’ s office and asked Bradley why Malik hadn ’ t been dismissed if there were other grounds for firing him . Fassler then called and was put on speakerphone . He said Bradley ’ s remarks to her were “ inappropriate ” and tried to explain his comment by saying he had reasons to fire everyone in the office , including her . That further upset her .
The woman then pressed Bradley on why the office did not reach out to the former employees she had said could speak to Malik ’ s behavior . Bradley told her that lawyers recommended not contacting former employees , according to contemporaneous notes of the conversation that Gillibrand ’ s office said were “ not accurate . ”
Robbie Kaplan , a co-founder of the TIME ’ S UP Legal Defense Fund , spoke with ███ last week at the request of Gillibrand ’ s office . While Kaplan declined to speak on the record about this particular case , she said the decision whether to interview former employees varies from case to case depending on the facts and circumstances . “ It ’ s always possible to look back and criticize with the benefit of hindsight , ” Kaplan said .
Knowing she was upset , Fassler called the woman back , apologized , and tried to affirm that she was satisfied with the outcome of the investigation , according to another email the woman wrote to herself that documented the conversation .
The woman said she had felt fine until her conversation with Bradley . Fassler said she must have just misinterpreted Bradley , to which she retorted : “ I ’ m getting tired of people saying I ’ m misinterpreting things . ”
Later that evening , the woman noticed that Malik did not update her when Gillibrand decided not to go to a softball game and then the next morning did not tell her that the senator was running behind schedule . She went to her bosses and said Malik was making her job more difficult in response to her reporting him . Though Gillibrand ’ s office contends such updates weren ’ t required , Malik had regularly given the woman and others in the office notice in the past .
Bradley consulted the Senate employment counsel again and Gillibrand ’ s office determined “ that no retaliation had occurred and that no disciplinary action was appropriate. ” It added that “ in one verbal conversation , [ Fassler ] proactively told her they looked into it and to let him know if anything continued . ”
Beyond that , Bradley and Fassler did not update the woman on the specific steps taken , the conclusions of the investigation , or any disciplinary action . That made her think the office didn ’ t take her complaint seriously .
Bradley exacerbated that feeling when she accidentally sent the woman an email intended for Fassler . “ I get the impression she is trying to divide and concur [ sic ] . After today , neither of us should meet with her alone , ” Bradley wrote , mistakenly believing that the woman had gone to Fassler alone with her complaint .
Gillibrand ’ s office argued it made many efforts to make the woman feel supported . Bradley and Fassler regularly checked in with her and assured her they “ believed ” her even if they did not dismiss Malik . Fassler canceled a meeting in which she and Malik would have had to be in the same room , and he talked to her about other opportunities in the office — positions she considered demotions — if she no longer wanted to work in her current role , which required her to interact with Malik .
And after the harassment investigation ended but before she quit , Gillibrand approached the woman and tried to console her with a quick hug and a “ We love you. ” The woman considered it an empty gesture .
On Aug. 13 , the woman told Fassler that she would resign and cited the office ’ s handling of the investigation . As she thought about the decision earlier that morning , the woman explained to a friend that “ [ Malik ] was using his position and relationship with the senator to solicit me . I acted the same as I always had : friendly , kind , outgoing , inclusive . But this time he decided to read it as me wanting him , ” according to a copy of the email .
She recalled that Fassler reacted defensively about the office ’ s handling of the allegations and told her that she had also committed fireable offenses during her time in the office . One comment by Fassler that particularly galled her , she said , was that investigation found that she had “ fed ” Malik alcohol while he was on duty as a driver . In her claim , she wrote that she and Malik had grabbed a quick drink in the courtyard of the Capitol late one afternoon to talk about the office . She was frustrated that Fassler was blaming her given that Malik is an adult capable of deciding what to consume .
“ I felt as though I was being belittled , insulted and intimidated even when I was trying to quit , ” she wrote in her resignation letter .
Gillibrand ’ s office acknowledged the exchange but said Fassler was obligated to raise what it called “ an unrelated office policy violation ” with the woman , referring to the alcohol incident . The office said Fassler , throughout the case , “ repeatedly demonstrated his respect and gratitude for the employee , and he was grateful she came forward . ”
Fassler asked her to reconsider resigning and then offered to allow her to stay until she found a new job so she could keep her health benefits .
She decided to leave . In her final days at the office , the woman agonized over whether to send the letter to Gillibrand . Doing so would almost certainly burn bridges and likely hurt her professional prospects in the clubby world of national politics .
It was Gillibrand ’ s female-focused advocacy that had made the woman want to work for her in the first place . For years , the senator has positioned herself at the forefront of fighting sexual misconduct in the military and in Congress . She wrote in Fortune last April that “ Congress has a sexual harassment problem—and isn ’ t taking it seriously , ” and helped push through legislation to overhaul the institution ’ s practices .
“ Whether it ’ s in the military , a college campus , the NFL , corporate America , or the halls of Congress , survivors of harassment too often continue to be disbelieved , blamed , and even retaliated against , ” Gillibrand wrote . `` This stops when we value all people — women and men who are harassed — and when we listen , believe them , and create a system in which justice is possible . ”
Gillibrand has made her advocacy for women the animating cause of her presidential bid — which the woman had hoped to work on — describing her approach to the Democratic primary as “ women plus . ”
“ Our campaign is confronting the toxic culture of sexism and misogyny in our political system , ” a Facebook ad last month read . “ We ’ re fighting for women to be heard . We ’ re fighting to be valued . ”
But the woman said the rhetoric belies her own experience . She is now considering a career outside of politics and far away from Washington .","Abbas Malik, pictured in an Army uniform, was an aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand from 2011 until last week, serving as her driver and military adviser. He was accused of sexual harassment by a former Gillibrand staffer. | Staten Island Advance/SILive.com 2020 Elections Former Gillibrand aide resigned in protest over handling of sex harassment claims What happened when #MeToo hit the office of one of its leaders, 2020 candidate Kirsten Gillibrand.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), one of the most outspoken advocates of the #MeToo movement who has made fighting sexual misconduct a centerpiece of her presidential campaign, spent last summer pressing legislators to update Congress’ “broken” system of handling sexual harassment.

At the same time, a mid-20s female aide to Gillibrand resigned in protest over the handling of her sexual harassment complaint by Gillibrand‘s office, and criticized the senator for failing to abide by her own public standards.

Story Continued Below

In July, the female staffer alleged one of Gillibrand’s closest aides — who was a decade her senior and married — repeatedly made unwelcome advances after the senator had told him he would be promoted to a supervisory role over her. She also said the male aide regularly made crude, misogynistic remarks in the office about his female colleagues and potential female hires.

Less than three weeks after reporting the alleged harassment and subsequently claiming that the man retaliated against her for doing so, the woman told chief of staff Jess Fassler that she was resigning because of the office’s handling of the matter. She did not have another job lined up.

The woman was granted anonymity because she fears retaliation and damage to her future professional prospects.

“I have offered my resignation because of how poorly the investigation and post-investigation was handled,” the woman wrote to Gillibrand in a letter sent on her final day to the senator's personal email account. Copied were general counsel Keith Castaldo and Fassler, who is now managing the senator’s presidential bid.

“I trusted and leaned on this statement that you made: ‘You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable.’ Your office chose to go against your public belief that women shouldn’t accept sexual harassment in any form and portrayed my experience as a misinterpretation instead of what it actually was: harassment and ultimately, intimidation,” the woman wrote.

The senator and her staff never responded to the letter.

Gillibrand, who was not made available for an interview, issued a statement to POLITICO defending her office’s handling of the incident.

“These are challenges that affect all of our nation’s workplaces, including mine, and the question is whether or not they are taken seriously. As I have long said, when allegations are made in the workplace, we must believe women so that serious investigations can actually take place, we can learn the facts, and there can be appropriate accountability,” she said. “That’s exactly what happened at every step of this case last year. I told her that we loved her at the time and the same is true today.”

Her office said no one responded to the letter because it determined that “engaging again on an already settled personnel matter was not the appropriate course of action.” It said the letter came after she’d given three weeks’ notice, “contained clear inaccuracies and was a major departure from the sentiments she shared with senior staff in her final days in the office.”

Since she left last summer, the woman has been doing part-time contract work. The male aide, Abbas Malik, kept his job.

Two weeks ago, however, POLITICO presented the office with its own findings of additional allegations of inappropriate workplace conduct by Malik. Among the claims were that he made a “joke” about rape to a female colleague — a person whom the office had failed to contact last summer despite repeated urgings by Malik’s accuser to reach out to the person.

Gillibrand’s office opened a new investigation and dismissed Malik last week. Malik did not respond to requests for comment.

The episode suggests a disconnect between the senator’s categorical public stance and her office’s private actions. It also points to broader problems with sexual harassment investigations on Capitol Hill: They are usually conducted internally by top aides with pre-existing relationships in the office rather than by an independent third party — a structure that Gillibrand has criticized in other institutions such as the military. The system can leave Capitol Hill aides ill-served, since those involved in an investigation have a motivation to protect the lawmaker.

And the case highlights the challenges of responding to alleged sexual harassment when it hits home, even for a leader on the issue. Malik had spent years by Gillibrand’s side as her driver — the senator officiated at his wedding — while the woman was a more recent hire and had significantly less stature in the office. He was accused not of physical harassment but of making unwanted advances and using demeaning language — behavior that can be easier to downplay and can require a higher level of diligence to get to the bottom of.

Gillibrand’s advisers said they took the woman’s claims seriously, consulted with Senate employment lawyers for guidance and punished Malik at the time for what they could substantiate. But after “a full and thorough investigation into the evidence, including multiple interviews with current employees who could have witnessed this behavior, the office concluded that the allegations did not meet the standard of sexual harassment,” the office said of its initial internal investigation.

That inquiry, however, left out key former staffers. The aides who led it — deputy chief of staff Anne Bradley and Castaldo — did not contact two former employees whom the woman said could corroborate and add to her allegations of inappropriate workplace conduct. Gillibrand’s office interviewed only current employees.

“Anyone doing a thorough investigation would contact any witness that had or was likely to have relevant information, particularly when there is a hostile working environment alleged,” said Les Alderman, an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment in the workplace and represented an alleged victim in a case against former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) that garnered national attention last year. “The idea that an employer is somehow restricted from contacting former employees who could shed light on the situation is laughable.”

POLITICO reached out to more than 20 former Gillibrand staffers to see if there was a pattern of behavior by Malik, including the two aides the woman specifically asked the office to contact.

One of those two former staffers said Malik often called her fat and unattractive to her face and made light of sexual abuse. She recalled one instance in which Malik remarked that a particular woman they were talking about “couldn’t get laid unless she was raped.” The person did not report that behavior at the time but now says she wishes she had.

Two more staffers who worked for Gillibrand said the woman’s claims of Malik’s inappropriate workplace behavior matched their own experiences. They said Malik regularly made misogynistic jokes, frequently appraised what they wore, disparaged the looks of other female staffers and rated the attractiveness of women who came in for interviews.

The office also dispensed with the allegations of Malik‘s retaliation without informing the woman of its conclusions or any disciplinary action.

Gillibrand’s office acknowledged it found evidence that Malik had made unspecified inappropriate comments and revoked his expected promotion, which would have come with a raise. It also moved his desk and gave him a final warning. This was not the first time the senator’s top aides dealt with an allegation of bad behavior by Malik: According to a firsthand witness of an incident in 2015, Malik confronted a fellow aide in the office. He got in the man’s face, pushed his desk and threatened to “fucking” hurt him, the witness said, describing the confrontation as “violent.”

But Fassler and Bradley told the woman that her claim of inappropriate advances was a case of “misinterpretation” and too much of a “he said, she said” to warrant Malik‘s dismissal, according to contemporaneous notes taken by the woman.

The office did not deny those terms were used but disputed that characterization of the investigation. “This case was never viewed as ‘he said, she said.’ Upon conclusion of the full and thorough investigation, it was determined that the evidence revealed employee misconduct that, while inappropriate, did not constitute sexual harassment,” the office said.

“When I had the courage to speak up about my harasser, I was belittled by her office and treated like an inconvenience,” the woman said of Gillibrand in an interview. “She kept a harasser on her staff until it proved politically untenable for her to do so.”

As part of her freelance work for an events production firm, she staffed the kickoff rally for one of Gillibrand’s rivals in the Democratic presidential primary. She has not done any other work for that or other presidential campaigns, and is not interviewing with any 2020 contenders.

‘Why do I love you! I should hate you!’



Malik became Gillibrand’s driver in 2011 after serving two tours in the Iraq War. He became such a constant presence in Gillibrand’s life — he had a set of keys to her home and often drove her children to school with her — that some staffers dubbed him “the keeper of her purse.” The office changed his title to “military adviser” in 2015 despite his responsibilities remaining largely the same.

Though she said she was put off by Malik’s comments about other female aides, the woman said her dealings with him had been generally cordial. But that changed when Gillibrand told him on July 10, 2018, that she wanted him to direct advance work for her future trips. All the details of the new job hadn’t been settled, but Abbas told the woman that he would be “in charge” of her position, she said.

“I have treated [A]bbas the same the entire year I have worked here,” the woman wrote in a detailed timeline of events that she later sent to Bradley, the deputy chief of staff. “It wasn’t until after this ‘promotion’ that he decided to hit on me.”

According to that timeline and documentation sent to Gillibrand’s office at the time, the alleged harassment started almost immediately after word of the planned promotion, with increasingly aggressive advances. In one late-night text message, Malik told her he now understood the meaning of the clown emoji — it meant “down to clown,” an innuendo for having sex from the movie “Blockers,” he elaborated the next morning.

On one day alone, July 13, she said Malik made four unwanted advances, which were all rebuffed. The first occurred alone in the office early in the morning when Malik told the woman he had a secret for her: Her boss had just quit.

“Ugh I shouldn’t have told you. You are totally going to tell people,” he said, according to her notes. “Why do I love you! I should hate you!”

After Malik prodded her for a secret of her own, she said Malik walked up to her desk and asked, “If we had met in a bar would it have happened for us?”

And at a birthday party for another staffer that evening, Malik told her privately that “I thought by debrief you meant you were hitting on me,” referencing an earlier text message.

She asked him if he was kidding. “No, I’m not kidding,” he responded. “[O]h wow ok no I was absolutely not hitting on you,” she replied, according to her timeline. He pressed two more times, prompting the woman to chide him in a text: “You’re married!!” He still sent a string of flirtatious texts later, including one with a clown emoji.

The woman said she tried to stay away from Malik the following week. But he began complaining that she was being mean to him because of his expected promotion, and said that he would give her the silent treatment until she apologized. “This seriously was so upsetting to me because I was not upset about that. I was upset with him sexually harassing me and he is trying to create his own narrative,” she wrote in her timeline.

On July 25, the woman emailed Bradley her detailed recollection of events, which she had written over the previous week. In addition to the advances, the woman claimed that Malik “said derogatory and inappropriate things about women since I started here.” She alleged that Malik called a female colleague “fat” and “ugly,” would rate the appearance of potential hires, and told colleagues that the office’s new fellow — essentially a young female intern — “wanted him.”

Bradley immediately looped in Fassler, who called the woman. They both assured her they were taking the accusations seriously.

When she learned on July 30 that the office had disciplined but not fired Malik, the woman was upset. But at the time, she trusted that the office did all it could. “I felt satisfied there had been a fair process,” she recounted in her resignation letter.

And after the harassment investigation ended but before she quit, Gillibrand approached the woman and tried to console her with a quick hug and a “We love you.” The woman considered it an empty gesture.

The breaking point



On Aug. 13, the woman told Fassler that she would resign and cited the office’s handling of the investigation.

She decided to leave. In her final days at the office, the woman agonized over whether to send the letter to Gillibrand. Doing so would almost certainly burn bridges and likely hurt her professional prospects in the clubby world of national politics.

It was Gillibrand’s female-focused advocacy that had made the woman want to work for her in the first place.

Gillibrand has made her advocacy for women the animating cause of her presidential bid — which the woman had hoped to work on — describing her approach to the Democratic primary as “women plus.”

“Our campaign is confronting the toxic culture of sexism and misogyny in our political system,” a Facebook ad last month read. “We’re fighting for women to be heard. We’re fighting to be valued.”

It turns out that the Keystone Cops detective work by conservative legal activist Ed Whelan — which set Washington abuzz with the promise of exonerating Brett Kavanaugh , only to be met by mockery and then partially retracted — was not his handiwork alone .
CRC Public Relations , the prominent Alexandria , Virginia-based P.R . firm , guided Whelan through his roller-coaster week of Twitter pronouncements that ended in embarrassment and a potential setback for Kavanaugh ’ s hopes of landing on the high court , according to three sources familiar with their dealings .
After suggesting on Twitter on Tuesday that he had obtained information that would exculpate Kavanaugh from the sexual assault allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford , Whelan worked over the next 48 hours with CRC and its president , Greg Mueller , to stoke the anticipation . A longtime friend of Kavanaugh ’ s , Whelan teased his reveal — even as he refused to discuss it with other colleagues and close friends , a half dozen of them said . At the same time , he told them he was absolutely confident the information he had obtained would exculpate the judge .
The hype ping-ponged from Republicans on Capitol Hill to Kavanaugh ’ s team in the White House , evidence of an extraordinarily successful public relations campaign that ultimately backfired when Whelan ’ s theory — complete with architectural drawings and an alleged Kavanaugh doppelgänger — landed with a thud on Twitter Thursday evening .
The coordinated effort was a testament to the far-reaching but frenzied attempt among conservatives to save Kavanaugh , which appeared to have spun out of the White House ’ s control . Indeed , Whelan told associates that he had kept his friend Kavanaugh and those working with him in the White House in the dark about his plans .

It turns out that the Keystone Cops detective work by conservative legal activist Ed Whelan — which set Washington abuzz with the promise of exonerating Brett Kavanaugh, only to be met by mockery and then partially retracted — was not his handiwork alone.

CRC Public Relations, the prominent Alexandria, Virginia-based P.R. firm, guided Whelan through his roller-coaster week of Twitter pronouncements that ended in embarrassment and a potential setback for Kavanaugh’s hopes of landing on the high court, according to three sources familiar with their dealings.

Story Continued Below

After suggesting on Twitter on Tuesday that he had obtained information that would exculpate Kavanaugh from the sexual assault allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford, Whelan worked over the next 48 hours with CRC and its president, Greg Mueller, to stoke the anticipation. A longtime friend of Kavanaugh’s, Whelan teased his reveal — even as he refused to discuss it with other colleagues and close friends, a half dozen of them said. At the same time, he told them he was absolutely confident the information he had obtained would exculpate the judge.

The hype ping-ponged from Republicans on Capitol Hill to Kavanaugh’s team in the White House, evidence of an extraordinarily successful public relations campaign that ultimately backfired when Whelan’s theory — complete with architectural drawings and an alleged Kavanaugh doppelgänger — landed with a thud on Twitter Thursday evening.

The coordinated effort was a testament to the far-reaching but frenzied attempt among conservatives to save Kavanaugh, which appeared to have spun out of the White House’s control. Indeed, Whelan told associates that he had kept his friend Kavanaugh and those working with him in the White House in the dark about his plans.

Thanks in part to the anticipation Whelan ginned up, Republicans who had gotten excited by the prospect that he really did have information that would solve Kavanaugh’s problems drew attention to Whelan. They later insisted they were kept in the dark until he went public, and fled from any association with Whelan’s theory.

CRC, however, was right there with him all along.

On Friday, hours after Whelan called his decision to name and post photographs of Kavanaugh’s high school classmate “an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment,” CRC helped organize a news conference featuring an array of women who dismissed Ford’s allegations.

Best known for its work with the Swift Boat Veterans in 2004, CRC bills itself as a full-service communications firm “specializing in media relations, social media and issues management,” according to its website. It has long been the go-to communications firm for conservative organizations in Washington and across the country. Its current clients include the Federalist Society and the Judicial Crisis Network, the chief outside groups working to help confirm Kavanaugh.

After unsuccessful attempts to persuade reporters to chase down a theory he put forward on Twitter — that the high school party described by Ford may have taken place at the home of a particular high school classmate of Kavanaugh’s, and that that classmate may have been the perpetrator of the alleged attack — Whelan worked with CRC's Mueller to devise a strategy that would draw attention to his theory, according to two sources familiar with his plans. That involved teasing the idea that he would make a big reveal but remaining mysteriously tight-lipped about what he had uncovered.

Neither Whelan nor the CRC's president responded to a request for comment.

In a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday evening, Whelan strongly suggested he had obtained information that would clear Kavanaugh’s name. “By one week from today, I expect that Judge Kavanaugh will have been clearly vindicated on this matter.” He continued, “Specifically, I expect that compelling evidence will show his categorical denial to be truthful. There will be no cloud over him.”

For 48 hours, he declined to share that “compelling evidence” with close colleagues or Kavanaugh allies. Several have said privately that they regret that decision because they would have advised Whelan against the course of action that CRC advised, and that he eventually took.

Kavanaugh himself, who largely remained cloistered in the White House preparing for a hearing since Ford went public with the allegations on Sunday, was also ignorant of Whelan’s plans, according to two sources close to him.

But Whelan’s tweets piqued the interest of Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee and inside the White House.

It is unclear to what extent Whelan was coordinating with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and other Republicans on Capitol Hill.

A former CRC employee, Garrett Ventry, had been working for Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) until Saturday, when he resigned after news surfaced that he had faced accusations of sexual harassment in the past. NBC News first reported the resignation.

Ventry did not respond to an email seeking comment and said in a Twitter post that the Committee had no foreknowledge of Whelan’s plans. It is not clear whether Ventry remains an employee of CRC, where he worked as recently as July.

HARRISBURG , Pa. ( AP ) — A priest raped a 7-year-old girl while visiting her in the hospital after she had her tonsils removed . Another priest forced a 9-year-old boy into having oral sex , then rinsed out the youngster ’ s mouth with holy water . One boy was forced to say confession to the priest who sexually abused him .
An estimated 300 Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania molested more than 1,000 children — and possibly many more — since the 1940s , according to a scathing Pennsylvania grand jury report released Tuesday that accused senior church officials , including the man who is now archbishop of Washington , D.C. , of systematically covering up complaints .
The “ real number ” of victimized children and abusive priests might be higher since some secret church records were lost and some victims never came forward , the grand jury said in the report that is the largest of its kind in the United States .
U.S. bishops adopted widespread reforms in 2002 when clergy abuse became a national crisis for the church , including stricter requirements for reporting accusations to law enforcement and a streamlined process for removing clerics . But the grand jury said more changes are needed .

Cardinal Donald Wuerl , leader of the Washington Archdiocese , was accused in the report of helping to protect abusive priests when he was Pittsburgh ’ s bishop from 1988 to 2006 .
At a Mass held Wednesday in Washington on the feast of the Assumption of Mary , Wuerl did not address the accusations against himself , but urged parishioners not to lose confidence in the church over the “ terrible plague ” of abuse .

The grand jury heard from dozens of witnesses and reviewed more than a half-million pages of internal diocesan documents , including reports by bishops to Vatican officials about the allegations against priests .
The panel concluded that a succession of bishops and other diocesan leaders tried to shield the church from bad publicity and financial liability .

The Boy Scouts of America has filed for bankruptcy, a sign of the century-old organization's financial instability as it faces some 300 lawsuits from men who say they were sexually abused as Scouts.

The organization says it will use the Chapter 11 process to create a trust to provide compensation to victims. Scouting programs will continue throughout.

The Boy Scouts had been exploring the possibility of bankruptcy since at least December 2018, when the group hired a law firm for a possible Chapter 11 filing. Chapter 11 usually involves the debtor making a reorganization plan to keep its business alive and pay its creditors over time.

The filing was made in Delaware and is expected to set a new deadline for victims' claims to be made.

The Boy Scouts also published a carefully worded open letter to victims of abuse. The letter, signed by BSA National Chair Jim Turley, reads in part:

""I am outraged that individuals took advantage of our programs to commit these heinous acts.

Two of the women also said they were retaliated against for not acquiescing to Moonves ’ s overtures .
“ What happened to me was a sexual assault , and then I was fired for not participating , ” actress and writer Illeana Douglas , who said Moonves “ violently kissed her ” and held her down in his office in 1997 , told the New Yorker .

Moonves , whose name has been associated with CBS for decades , will now face an inquiry , CBS ’ s board of directors said Friday , ahead of Farrow ’ s article .

Julie Chen , the CBS TV show host and news anchor who is married to Moonves , stood by her husband ’ s statement :

The attorney general for New York said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached to settle two sexual misconduct lawsuits on behalf of multiple women against Harvey Weinstein for nearly $ 19m .
But attorneys representing six of the women who have made accusations against the imprisoned former film producer called the proposed deal a “ sellout ” that did not require Weinstein , 68 , to accept responsibility or personally pay out any money .
Harvey Weinstein begins 23-year sentence at New York state prison Read more
The settlement , which still must be approved by a federal judge and a bankruptcy court , would resolve a lawsuit filed against Weinstein , his production company and his brother in 2018 by the New York attorney general ’ s office .
It would also settle a separate class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of women who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault , said the New York attorney general , Letitia James .
“ After all the harassment , threats , and discrimination , these survivors are finally receiving some semblance of justice , ” she said on Twitter .
The agreement was announced by James and Chicago attorney Elizabeth Fegan .
The deal , if approved by judges in federal courts , would permit accusers to claim from $ 7,500 to $ 750,000 from the $ 18.8m settlement .
The former Hollywood producer was convicted earlier this year of rape and sexual assault against two women .
Accusations by dozens of women in 2017 destroyed his career and gave rise to # MeToo , the global movement to hold powerful men accountable for their sexual misconduct .
The 68-year-old former film producer was diagnosed in March with the coronavirus just days after he was moved to the state ’ s maximum security Wende correctional facility near Buffalo to begin serving his 23-year prison sentence .
“ This settlement is the culmination of several years of hard work by survivors who not only initiated the # MeToo movement around Weinstein , but also used their platforms to seek justice for all of those who were afraid to come forward for fear of retaliation in Hollywood , ” Fegan said .
Included in the news release was a statement by plaintiff Caitlin Dulany , who said Weinstein isolated and assaulted her after they met in 1996 at the Cannes Film Festival .
“ When I came forward and shared my story about the assault , I knew there wouldn ’ t be a straight path to justice , ” Dulany said .
“ Harvey avoided accountability for decades , leveraging his power to hide behind a web of deceit , and I was determined to join the class action to ensure meaningful change for all survivors , ” she said . “ I am proud that this settlement will help so many women who are long overdue for justice and relief . ”
James said in a release that the deal would resolve claims in a New York state lawsuit and in a class-action lawsuit that was pending in federal court .
She called it “ a win for every woman who has experienced sexual harassment , discrimination , intimidation , or retaliation by her employer ” .

The attorney general for New York said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached to settle two sexual misconduct lawsuits on behalf of multiple women against Harvey Weinstein for nearly $19m.

But attorneys representing six of the women who have made accusations against the imprisoned former film producer called the proposed deal a “sellout” that did not require Weinstein, 68, to accept responsibility or personally pay out any money.

The settlement, which still must be approved by a federal judge and a bankruptcy court, would resolve a lawsuit filed against Weinstein, his production company and his brother in 2018 by the New York attorney general’s office.

It would also settle a separate class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of women who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault, said the New York attorney general, Letitia James.

“After all the harassment, threats, and discrimination, these survivors are finally receiving some semblance of justice,” she said on Twitter.



The agreement was announced by James and Chicago attorney Elizabeth Fegan.

The deal, if approved by judges in federal courts, would permit accusers to claim from $7,500 to $750,000 from the $18.8m settlement.

The former Hollywood producer was convicted earlier this year of rape and sexual assault against two women.

Accusations by dozens of women in 2017 destroyed his career and gave rise to #MeToo, the global movement to hold powerful men accountable for their sexual misconduct.

The 68-year-old former film producer was diagnosed in March with the coronavirus just days after he was moved to the state’s maximum security Wende correctional facility near Buffalo to begin serving his 23-year prison sentence.

“This settlement is the culmination of several years of hard work by survivors who not only initiated the #MeToo movement around Weinstein, but also used their platforms to seek justice for all of those who were afraid to come forward for fear of retaliation in Hollywood,” Fegan said.

Included in the news release was a statement by plaintiff Caitlin Dulany, who said Weinstein isolated and assaulted her after they met in 1996 at the Cannes Film Festival.

“When I came forward and shared my story about the assault, I knew there wouldn’t be a straight path to justice,” Dulany said.

“Harvey avoided accountability for decades, leveraging his power to hide behind a web of deceit, and I was determined to join the class action to ensure meaningful change for all survivors,” she said. “I am proud that this settlement will help so many women who are long overdue for justice and relief.”

James said in a release that the deal would resolve claims in a New York state lawsuit and in a class-action lawsuit that was pending in federal court.

She called it “a win for every woman who has experienced sexual harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or retaliation by her employer”.

Gerald Maatman, lead counsel for the Weinstein Companies, declined comment.

In the anonymous report—published over the weekend by Babe—a woman shares her account the alleged misconduct which took place on a date in September 2017 .
The responses to the woman 's story are peppered with the word `` should . '' She should have said no ; she should have walked out ; she should never have taken off her clothes ; she should n't have been there in the first place . These responses , which are disturbingly widespread , not only shift the blame and responsibility onto the woman , they also fail to recognise an important truth . For many women , uttering an explicit `` no '' is not as easy or straightforward as you might think .
The woman—who 's identified as `` Grace '' —describes going out for dinner with Ansari before going to his apartment where events took place which left her feeling `` violated '' . Grace describes using verbal and non-verbal cues to convey how `` uncomfortable and distressed she was . ''
`` Most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling . I know that my hand stopped moving at some points , '' Grace told Babe . `` I stopped moving my lips and turned cold . He probably moved my hand to his dick five to seven times , '' says Grace . `` He really kept doing it after I moved it away . ''
One moment in particular is depicted as `` particularly significant '' for Grace . She leaves the room , and spends around five minutes in the bathroom before re-entering .
He asked her if she was okay . “ I said I don ’ t want to feel forced because then I ’ ll hate you , and I ’ d rather not hate you , ” she said .
Grace told Babe that this remark about `` not wanting to feel `` forced '' '' had `` added a verbal component to the cues she was trying to give him about her discomfort '' . Grace says that , despite raising a verbal red flag about her discomfort , Ansari `` motioned '' for Grace to perform oral sex on him .
Ansari instructed her to turn around . “ He sat back and pointed to his penis and motioned for me to go down on him . And I did . I think I just felt really pressured . It was literally the most unexpected thing I thought would happen at that moment because I told him I was uncomfortable. ” Soon , he pulled her back up onto the couch . She would tell her friend via text later that night , “ He [ made out ] with me again and says , ‘ Doesn ’ t look like you hate me . ’ ”
Ansari responded to the allegations in statement , in which he appeared to agree with Grace 's account of the evening . Ansari said `` by all indications '' the `` sexual activity '' that took place was `` completely consensual . ''
The next day , I got a text from her saying that although “ it may have seemed okay , ” upon further reflection , she felt uncomfortable . It was true that everything did seem okay to me , so when I heard that it was not the case for her , I was surprised and concerned . I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said .
Since this story 's publication , one troubling thread of conversation has persisted . The assertion that Grace should have said something . A quick glance at the Twitter responses to Babe 's tweet will give you a sense of the kind of views being shared :
`` You know what 's clearer than any non-verbal cue ? A verbal one . * Gasp * '' wrote one person .
`` There were a couple of moments where `` Grace '' could 've easily walked away and go home after all the foreplay you claim you were doing . Just say you should meet another time with a better state of mind or not see him ever again , '' reads another reply .
`` Maybe verbal clues would have been best . Something like , I 'm not interested pal , '' wrote another . `` Ok I 'm sorry but 1st what did she was gon na happen going to his pad .. and 2nd the very second she felt uncomfortable she shoulda said ' got ta go .. bye ! ' plain and simple , '' reads another response .
What 's absent from this discussion is an acknowledgement that saying `` no '' is not always simple and straightforward . This statement does n't take into account most women 's overwhelming fear of what could follow that verbalised `` no . ''
Writer Sady Doyle addressed some of these responses in a Twitter thread . `` `` But why didn ’ t she leave ? ! ” Because — and this is crucial— he kept telling her he was going to stop . He systematically paused right before she fully freaked out , made her feel safe again , then resumed assaulting her , at a greater level of assault each time . ''
So many women can identify with the fear of saying no , myself included . I have been in sexual situations that have made me feel uncomfortable , vulnerable and scared . Fear prevented me from saying no or walking away . Fear of what , you might ask ? I was afraid that if I said no , I would be further harmed , or even killed .

But all the above constitute a serious concern for Biden and his backers , because they highlight a fundamental vulnerability that will burden him if he makes another bid for the Oval Office .
On the most obvious level , complaints of this kind renew the criticism of Biden 's past performance on issues affecting women and people of color , the two constituencies likely to matter most in choosing the next Democratic nominee .

Arizona Republican Trent Franks has resigned amid an ethics investigation into claims he repeatedly asked female staff to be surrogate mothers.

The announcement came after a congressional panel said it was opening an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against Mr Franks.

The lawmaker acknowledged discussing surrogacy with two female aides when he and his wife were facing infertility.

He is the third member of Congress to resign in three days.

The Associated Press reports one of Mr Franks' former aides accuses him of offering her $5m (£3.7m) to act as a surrogate mother, repeatedly pressing her to carry his child.

An institution in turmoil

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

In the space of one week, three members of Congress have announced they are resigning because of sexual misconduct allegations. That, in all likelihood, is just the beginning.

If the past is any guide, the worst transgressions and abuses of power come in institutions - Hollywood, the Catholic Church, the athletic department of a major state university - where authority is unchecked and accountability is limited. The halls of Congress all too often fit that description.

Each congressional office is like a mini kingdom, with the member of Congress as monarch. Employees work at the ""will and pleasure"" of the elected politician. Staffers share stories of abuse - sometimes of the walk-my-dog, pick-up-my-dry-cleaning variety and sometimes much darker.

Those darker stories are beginning to come to light. Journalists are digging, and there are already reports of dozens of legislators under the microscope.

Both parties are being tested. If politicians in Washington aren't sweating, they should be.

The real test, however, will come when voters head to the polls in the months ahead. Will they hold lawmakers accountable? The answer will go a long way to determining whether the #MeToo movement is a blip or if it will fundamentally reshape the Washington power structure.

The ethics committee also announced on Thursday it was investigating Texas Republican Blake Farenthold amid claims of sexual misconduct against him by a former member of staff.

It was revealed last week that Mr Farenthold used $84,000 of taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with his former communications director.

Resignations of two Democratic lawmakers have shaken Washington this week.

Democratic congressman John Conyers announced on Tuesday that he will step down after multiple aides accused him of sexual misconduct.

Hours before Mr Franks' announcement, Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken said he too was resigning over claims of groping after several Democrats called on him to step down.",www.bbc.com,center,fEoqApFpE3pTAs7p

Also of note: While Argento's alleged conduct does indeed meet the definition of sexual assault, this is only because the age of consent in California is 18. In most other states, it's 16 or 17. Since Bennett was 17 at the time of the encounter, it would have been legal for Argento to have sex with him in 39 of the 50 states. That doesn't make Argento's decision to have sex with this particular young man, with whom she had a quasi-maternal bond, any less creepy.

In the wake of #MeToo, they had reconsidered their worship of Teddy Kennedy, their pathetic willingness to cover for Bill Clinton. A new day had dawned.

Then there was the second, more cynical theory: Democrats and their media allies were looking to set a new standard out of pure partisanship. They weren't really concerned about Franken's victims any more than they had been about Clinton's victims. Instead, they were looking to establish a level of morally superior ground upon which to attack Trump and demand that Republicans disown him.

This week, we found out which theory was true.

Mayer, the New Yorker reporter, rose to public acclaim just last year when she reported on then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's supposed sexual evils. With no supporting facts other than the hazy accounts of decades-old events, she attacked Kavanaugh with alacrity. Now, however, she has flipped: She's concerned with Franken's lack of due process; she questions the political motivations of one of his accusers; she points out that the evidence is supposedly scanty. Democrats, too, have risen to Franken's defense. Many now claim that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was the real villain in this scenario, having rushed for Franken's scalp precipitously.

In other words, Franken was kicked out of the party when Democrats were trying to build a case against Trump. Now that they've concluded that case won't work, they want Franken back again. Presumably, they'll soon be back to praising Clinton, too.

This sort of behavior is deeply destructive to American public discourse. That's because a standard upheld only as a weapon to target political opposition is no standard at all. What's more, the partisan interpretation of the standard creates an incentive for opponents to violate their own commitment to the standard. It's a classic prisoner's dilemma: The person who actually abides by a common moral standard and speaks out against bad behavior on all sides ends up the sucker. Only a fool would call out his own side to the cheers of opponents while his opponents defend their own degenerates.

The problem of politically motivated standards isn't restricted to sexual abuse. It extends to race: Why should Republicans condemn President Trump's tweets about the so-called Squad while Democrats maintain support for Rep. Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitism and Rep. Ayanna Pressley's racism? Why should Republicans provide ammunition to their ill-motivated opponents?

The only way to restore a common standard in politics is for both sides to rebuild trust, step by step. And that can only happen when both sides share common goals and values. Otherwise, everyone will decide that losing by abiding by the rules must take a back seat to victory by any means. And that means the destruction of our standards, one by one, until there are no standards left.

sexual_misconduct,The Flip Side,1,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/jeffrey-epstein,Jeffrey Epstein,,,"Some suggest that Congress “ remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance… Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. ” Edward B. Foley , Politico
“ It is customary , when faced with the grotesque inequalities of the criminal-justice system , to decry the preferential treatment that people such as Jeffrey Epstein enjoy . Rather than complain that Epstein got too much justice , it would be far more productive to complain that most people get too little . Adequately funded criminal defense , bail reform , and other commonsense changes would do far more to improve the system than the prosecution of an occasional billionaire. ” Ken White , The Atlantic
“ There ’ s no doubt that the judicial system must examine the accusations against Mr. Epstein , and that the Justice Department will have many questions about Mr. Acosta ’ s apparent leniency toward him . Congress digging into this case , however , is a poor use of lawmakers ’ limited time and resources . More dangerous , in the midst of the Trump administration ’ s war on congressional oversight in general , such hearings carry a high risk of turning the Epstein case into a partisan battle — and Mr. Acosta into a political martyr around whom the president and his followers feel moved to rally… better to let the legal system and the court of public opinion carry this particular burden. ” Editorial Board , New York Times
Regarding Acosta , “ perhaps there was nothing [ he ] , amid mounting criticism , could have said at Wednesday ’ s press conference to make things right . But the proper approach , obvious to many , was to show some contrition . He could have acknowledged his mistakes and apologized for them . He could have highlighted why others shouldn ’ t discount victims of sexual abuse in the future as he once did . He could have even resigned . Acosta chose another path . He gave an astonishingly Trumpian performance : admit no error , shift responsibility , and blame the media . ” Matt Ford , New Republic
“ It took a network of people putting their own personal , financial , and sexual interests over the safety and dignity of girls to keep Epstein ’ s alleged child-abuse operation running . It will take a network that ’ s just as substantial to uncover the extent of Epstein ’ s possible crimes . It ’ s perverse , but there ’ s a direct relationship between the magnitude of a system of abuse and the magnitude of the effort required to end it . The fact that so many people appear to have known about and participated in Epstein ’ s alleged child-trafficking enterprise has not been a liability for him ; indeed , it has been his foremost strength. ” Christina Cauterucci , Slate
“ When most people get out of jail , they can barely get a job at a fast food joint . Not our man Epstein… Celebrities were still turning up at Epstein-hosted parties even after he was released from jail . The NYPD seemingly waived requirements that Epstein , a convicted sex offender , report in on a regular basis — [ a ] kindness the department doesn ’ t extend to the nonwhite or non-wealthy . More than a few charities and nonprofits continued to line up at the trough for a chance at his money… the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is something , I predict , that will come to be viewed in future years as one of the defining events that brings our age of excess to a close . ” Helaine Olen , Washington Post
“ The Epstein case is first and foremost about the casual victimization of vulnerable girls . But it is also a political scandal , if not a partisan one . It reveals a deep corruption among mostly male elites across parties , and the way the very rich can often purchase impunity for even the most loathsome of crimes. ” Michelle Goldberg , New York Times
The right argues that Bevin ’ s loss was an outlier , but nevertheless is concerned about what the overall results say about GOP prospects .
“ Perhaps the most historic , in the sense of era-defining , moment in the history of the Academy Awards was that standing ovation Roman Polanski got when he was given Best Director honors in 2003 . There they are , leading Hollywood liberals , leaping to their feet to cheer for a man who , at age 43 , gave a 13-year-old girl Quaaludes for the purpose of having sex with her and sodomizing her . Polanski suffered in no significant way for his crime…
“ The Jeffrey Epstein case should end a nearly 50-year era in which the mandarins of our cultures — the intellectuals , writers , and artists — almost unanimously ignored , laughed off , or even outright celebrated sexual exploitation of girls and very young women , even in many cases prepubescent ones… Epstein ’ s habits were so unremarkable that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were happy to be associated with him . Clinton and Trump were not outliers . They were simply symptoms of a disease . ”
Regarding Acosta , some note that in 2005 “ police brought the case to the local prosecutor , Barry Krischer , an elected Democratic official . But Krischer wasn ’ t interested in pursuing felony charges against Epstein , a well-known donor to political candidates ( mostly Democrats ) ... When Krischer refused , [ local police ] took the case to federal law enforcement . Federal prosecutors , it is important to note , generally have no jurisdiction over sex crimes . But they agreed to investigate whether Epstein violated federal law by , among other things , using the facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls into prostitution…
“ The U.S. Attorney ’ s Office determined that federal charges against Epstein might not stick . But they were able to leverage their investigation to extract a plea… While the punishment was inadequate to the crime , from all reports , the experienced , career prosecutors reporting to Acosta felt it was better than any alternative . The deal put Epstein behind bars , allowed his victims to seek restitution , and put the public on notice that Epstein is a sexual predator . ”
“ The vast majority of criminal cases end with plea bargains — about 94 % at the state level and 97 % at the federal level… Perhaps one of the only good things to come from Epstein ’ s case is the exposure of inappropriate or fraudulent plea deals in the justice system that let accused criminals walk away from a trial , and force others to plead guilty without a chance to claim innocence . Plea bargains guarantee efficiency : costly , time-consuming trials are avoided more often than not . But at what cost ? …
“ If anything , Acosta is a symptom of a justice system that is broken and rotting from within . He is not responsible for Epstein ’ s crimes , but he did facilitate a deal that resulted in a total lapse of accountability . President Trump must decide if this past failure requires Acosta ’ s resignation . And we must decide what to do about a criminal justice system that let a monster walk free . ”
“ On social media , lots of people seem to think that any revelations from this prosecution will be devastating to the party they oppose and avert their eyes from the possibility that Epstein could start talking about sordid and criminal behavior by prominent figures in their preferred party . Investigate them all , name them all , indict them all , prosecute them all . No figure is so important to a political party or the country that we need to avert our eyes from underage sex trafficking . ”
It ’ s worth noting that “ conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “ In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer ’ s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) ”
“ If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? … the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack ’ s attention you are going to have to do better than this . ”","Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again, Republicans cannot hide behind a claim that they are [the] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment.” Edward B. Foley, Politico

“It is customary, when faced with the grotesque inequalities of the criminal-justice system, to decry the preferential treatment that people such as Jeffrey Epstein enjoy. Rather than complain that Epstein got too much justice, it would be far more productive to complain that most people get too little . Adequately funded criminal defense, bail reform, and other commonsense changes would do far more to improve the system than the prosecution of an occasional billionaire.” Ken White, The Atlantic

“There’s no doubt that the judicial system must examine the accusations against Mr. Epstein, and that the Justice Department will have many questions about Mr. Acosta’s apparent leniency toward him. Congress digging into this case, however, is a poor use of lawmakers’ limited time and resources . More dangerous, in the midst of the Trump administration’s war on congressional oversight in general, such hearings carry a high risk of turning the Epstein case into a partisan battle — and Mr. Acosta into a political martyr around whom the president and his followers feel moved to rally… better to let the legal system and the court of public opinion carry this particular burden.” Editorial Board, New York Times

Regarding Acosta, “perhaps there was nothing [he], amid mounting criticism, could have said at Wednesday’s press conference to make things right. But the proper approach, obvious to many, was to show some contrition. He could have acknowledged his mistakes and apologized for them. He could have highlighted why others shouldn’t discount victims of sexual abuse in the future as he once did. He could have even resigned. Acosta chose another path. He gave an astonishingly Trumpian performance: admit no error, shift responsibility, and blame the media .” Matt Ford, New Republic

“It took a network of people putting their own personal, financial, and sexual interests over the safety and dignity of girls to keep Epstein’s alleged child-abuse operation running. It will take a network that’s just as substantial to uncover the extent of Epstein’s possible crimes. It’s perverse, but there’s a direct relationship between the magnitude of a system of abuse and the magnitude of the effort required to end it. The fact that so many people appear to have known about and participated in Epstein’s alleged child-trafficking enterprise has not been a liability for him; indeed, it has been his foremost strength.” Christina Cauterucci, Slate

“When most people get out of jail, they can barely get a job at a fast food joint. Not our man Epstein… Celebrities were still turning up at Epstein-hosted parties even after he was released from jail. The NYPD seemingly waived requirements that Epstein, a convicted sex offender, report in on a regular basis — [a] kindness the department doesn’t extend to the nonwhite or non-wealthy. More than a few charities and nonprofits continued to line up at the trough for a chance at his money… the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is something, I predict, that will come to be viewed in future years as one of the defining events that brings our age of excess to a close .” Helaine Olen, Washington Post

“The Epstein case is first and foremost about the casual victimization of vulnerable girls. But it is also a political scandal, if not a partisan one. It reveals a deep corruption among mostly male elites across parties , and the way the very rich can often purchase impunity for even the most loathsome of crimes.” Michelle Goldberg, New York Times

From the Right

The right argues that Bevin’s loss was an outlier, but nevertheless is concerned about what the overall results say about GOP prospects.

From the Right

“Perhaps the most historic, in the sense of era-defining, moment in the history of the Academy Awards was that standing ovation Roman Polanski got when he was given Best Director honors in 2003. There they are, leading Hollywood liberals, leaping to their feet to cheer for a man who, at age 43, gave a 13-year-old girl Quaaludes for the purpose of having sex with her and sodomizing her. Polanski suffered in no significant way for his crime…



“The Jeffrey Epstein case should end a nearly 50-year era in which the mandarins of our cultures — the intellectuals, writers, and artists — almost unanimously ignored, laughed off, or even outright celebrated sexual exploitation of girls and very young women, even in many cases prepubescent ones… Epstein’s habits were so unremarkable that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were happy to be associated with him. Clinton and Trump were not outliers. They were simply symptoms of a disease.”

Kyle Smith, National Review

Regarding Acosta, some note that in 2005 “police brought the case to the local prosecutor, Barry Krischer, an elected Democratic official. But Krischer wasn’t interested in pursuing felony charges against Epstein, a well-known donor to political candidates (mostly Democrats)... When Krischer refused, [local police] took the case to federal law enforcement. Federal prosecutors, it is important to note, generally have no jurisdiction over sex crimes. But they agreed to investigate whether Epstein violated federal law by, among other things, using the facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls into prostitution…



“The U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that federal charges against Epstein might not stick. But they were able to leverage their investigation to extract a plea… While the punishment was inadequate to the crime, from all reports, the experienced, career prosecutors reporting to Acosta felt it was better than any alternative. The deal put Epstein behind bars, allowed his victims to seek restitution, and put the public on notice that Epstein is a sexual predator.”

Jennifer Braceras, Washington Examiner

“The vast majority of criminal cases end with plea bargains — about 94% at the state level and 97% at the federal level… Perhaps one of the only good things to come from Epstein’s case is the exposure of inappropriate or fraudulent plea deals in the justice system that let accused criminals walk away from a trial, and force others to plead guilty without a chance to claim innocence. Plea bargains guarantee efficiency: costly, time-consuming trials are avoided more often than not. But at what cost?…



“If anything, Acosta is a symptom of a justice system that is broken and rotting from within. He is not responsible for Epstein’s crimes, but he did facilitate a deal that resulted in a total lapse of accountability. President Trump must decide if this past failure requires Acosta’s resignation. And we must decide what to do about a criminal justice system that let a monster walk free.”

Kaylee McGhee, Washington Examiner



“On social media, lots of people seem to think that any revelations from this prosecution will be devastating to the party they oppose and avert their eyes from the possibility that Epstein could start talking about sordid and criminal behavior by prominent figures in their preferred party. Investigate them all, name them all, indict them all, prosecute them all. No figure is so important to a political party or the country that we need to avert our eyes from underage sex trafficking.”

Jim Geraghty, National Review

It’s worth noting that “conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party. In Washington State, voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “In Seattle, the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger. In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Washington, Colorado, New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately.)”

Jim Geraghty, National Review

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.”

Patrick Buchanan, The American Conservative

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

The head of US media giant CBS, Les Moonves, has resigned with immediate effect following allegations of sexual misconduct.

CBS had been investigating Mr Moonves since allegations appeared in the New Yorker in July - and fresh accusations from six more women appeared on Sunday.

Mr Moonves, 68, denies the allegations, calling the latest ""appalling"".

In a statement CBS said a $20m (£15.4m) would be paid immediately in support of the #MeToo movement.

It said one or more organisations that supported #MeToo and female workplace equality stood to benefit, but did not specify which.

The donation has been deducted from any severance benefits that may be due to Mr Moonves - the amount of which is pending the results of an ongoing independent investigation into his conduct.

What are the latest allegations?

They appear in a new article in the New Yorker by Ronan Farrow, who also authored the July piece and this year shared a Pulitzer Prize for detailing assault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

The six women in the latest piece allege sexual harassment or assault by Mr Moonves between the 1980s and the first decade of this century.

Some allege he forced them to perform oral sex or exposed himself without their consent.

Some say he damaged their careers when they rebuffed him.

TV executive Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb and writer Jessica Pallingston are two of the women who give graphic descriptions of the misconduct they accuse Mr Moonves of carrying out.

Where does this leave CBS?

Under Mr Moonves' leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US. He developed hits like CSI and The Big Bang Theory, while his $69.3m (£53m) earnings in 2017 made him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world.

But the announcement of Mr Moonves' departure came at the same time as CBS said it was ending legal action against National Amusements. For its part, National Amusements said it would not seek a merger between the two companies for the next two years.

In a statement it announced that Mr Moonves would step down as chairman, president and CEO with immediate effect.

Joseph Ianniello will serve as president and acting CEO.

The Financial Times said Mr Moonves was resigning because this would entitle him to a hefty severance package, including stock options.

US media said the resignation package for Mr Moonves could amount to $100m.

However, CBS said he would not receive any severance benefits until the result of an independent investigation into him.

In a separate move, six directors have stepped down and six new ones have been elected.

House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , says the rash of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations coming to light could end up being a `` watershed moment '' in changing the culture — including on Capitol Hill — that has covered them up far too long .
`` We are having a watershed moment in this country . I think this is a defining moment in this country . And I think it needs to be a defining moment in this country , '' Ryan told Morning Edition 's Steve Inskeep in an interview on Capitol Hill on Thursday .
Politics Listen : House Speaker Paul Ryan Defends GOP Tax Plans In 'Morning Edition ' Interview Paul Ryan Defends GOP Tax Plans Listen · 7:02 7:02
`` I think we 're all horrified at these stories we 've been seeing unfold in the last few weeks . I think we 're all realizing that sexual harassment in America is absolutely pervasive and it 's got to go and we need to end it , '' Ryan continued . `` And nowhere more is this important to set a standard and an example than elected officials . We should be held to a high standard . ''
Politicians in both parties have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks . On Thursday , Ryan called for Rep. John Conyers , D-Mich. , to resign after a former aide made public her allegations of sexual harassment against the veteran lawmaker . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , also called on Conyers to step down . The Michigan Democrat has been hospitalized for stress .
Another accuser also came forward on Thursday against Sen. Al Franken , D-Minn. , alleging that he groped her during a 2003 photo opportunity , bringing his total accusers to five women who say the senator groped or forcibly kissed them in recent weeks . The Senate Ethics Committee confirms it has launched an initial inquiry into the allegations against Franken .
Meanwhile , Republicans are continuing to grapple with Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore , who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault when they were teens and he was in his 30s . Several women say he pursued them romantically , and one woman said he had sexually assaulted her when she was 14 .
President Trump himself was accused of sexual assault by several women during the 2016 campaign , allegations he continues to deny . And in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape that surfaced just ahead of the election Trump bragged about groping and forcibly kissing women . According to reports , Trump has now begun to privately assert that tape was a fake , despite acknowledging its veracity last year .
Inskeep asked Ryan about the differences between the allegations against Moore — which the House speaker reiterated he believed were `` very , very credible '' — and the accusations against Trump .

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., says the rash of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations coming to light could end up being a ""watershed moment"" in changing the culture — including on Capitol Hill — that has covered them up far too long.

""We are having a watershed moment in this country. I think this is a defining moment in this country. And I think it needs to be a defining moment in this country,"" Ryan told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep in an interview on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

""I think we're all horrified at these stories we've been seeing unfold in the last few weeks. I think we're all realizing that sexual harassment in America is absolutely pervasive and it's got to go and we need to end it,"" Ryan continued. ""And nowhere more is this important to set a standard and an example than elected officials. We should be held to a high standard.""

Politicians in both parties have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks. On Thursday, Ryan called for Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to resign after a former aide made public her allegations of sexual harassment against the veteran lawmaker. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also called on Conyers to step down. The Michigan Democrat has been hospitalized for stress.

Another accuser also came forward on Thursday against Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., alleging that he groped her during a 2003 photo opportunity, bringing his total accusers to five women who say the senator groped or forcibly kissed them in recent weeks. The Senate Ethics Committee confirms it has launched an initial inquiry into the allegations against Franken.

Meanwhile, Republicans are continuing to grapple with Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault when they were teens and he was in his 30s. Several women say he pursued them romantically, and one woman said he had sexually assaulted her when she was 14.

President Trump himself was accused of sexual assault by several women during the 2016 campaign, allegations he continues to deny. And in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape that surfaced just ahead of the election Trump bragged about groping and forcibly kissing women. According to reports, Trump has now begun to privately assert that tape was a fake, despite acknowledging its veracity last year.

Inskeep asked Ryan about the differences between the allegations against Moore — which the House speaker reiterated he believed were ""very, very credible"" — and the accusations against Trump.

The speaker said he was ""focused on Congress"" because that's where Moore wants to go. ""My job here as speaker of the House is to help make sure that Congress is an institution that we're proud of and that's what I'm focused on,"" he said.

Asked again about the differences, Ryan said, ""I haven't spent my time reviewing the difference in these two cases.""

Ryan admitted, ""It's no secret that [Trump] and I have had our differences of opinions,"" but he underscored they still align on policy issues and goals.

""What I see is a president who is fighting for the things that I'm fighting for. I see a president who's fighting for an agenda that will make a positive difference in people's lives,"" Ryan said. ""Is this president unconventional? No two ways about it. He's very unconventional. But if we make good by the American people by actually improving their lives and fixing problems and finding solutions that are bothering them? That's a good thing.""

All these recent political allegations are in addition to women coming forward with stories of sexual assault against high-profile Hollywood moguls such as Harvey Weinstein and journalists like NBC's Matt Lauer, CBS' Charlie Rose and top NPR executives as well.

Ryan told NPR that, as a father, the issue is a personal one for him as he has watched the swirl of scandal over the past few weeks.

""I want my daughter to grow up in a country — she's 15 years old — where she is empowered and respected. Wherever she goes, wherever she works, and whatever she does. And I think nowhere should that be more obvious and apparent than working here on Capitol Hill,"" Ryan said.

""So I think here in Congress we should set ourselves to standards that we expect of other people,"" the House speaker added. ""We should set high standards for ourselves, so that we can be role models and set examples, and clearly people have been falling short of that, and I think we always have to endeavor to do a better job on that.""

Congress has recently passed legislation to adopt mandatory training on harassment and discrimination for lawmakers and Capitol Hill employees. In a news conference on Thursday, Ryan applauded the legislation but also said, ""This is an important step, but it's one step.""

If convicted , she faces up to 35 years in federal prison .
At a press conference in Manhattan , federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss , acting US attorney for the southern district of New York , accused Maxwell of lying about allegations that she conspired with Epstein and also was directly responsible for some of the sexual abuse herself because the truth was “ almost unspeakable ” .

One of his four alleged victims — who said he routinely choked , slapped and spit on her — was told by several close friends to keep quiet about the abuse .
Not because it would be hard for her to prove the charges , or because Schneiderman , as New York ’ s top law enforcement official was a powerful figure .
No : They pressed the anonymous victim to keep silent because of Schneiderman ’ s liberal leadership , saying “ he was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose . ”
And , it appears , they weren ’ t alone : More women are now coming forward to detail similar allegations going back years . Apparently , his behavior wasn ’ t much of a secret in New York political circles .
But everyone looked the other way , rather than discredit a progressive Democratic hero . After all , Schneiderman had led the charge against Wall Street , against Donald Trump , against Exxon .

But it ’ s still worth asking , when next you hear a Democratic pol moralizing about the need to protect women , how many abuse victims were told to just “ suck it up ” for the cause .","Deep in the stunning New Yorker piece that felled Eric Schneiderman is a remarkable revelation.

One of his four alleged victims — who said he routinely choked, slapped and spit on her — was told by several close friends to keep quiet about the abuse.

Not because it would be hard for her to prove the charges, or because Schneiderman, as New York’s top law enforcement official was a powerful figure.

No: They pressed the anonymous victim to keep silent because of Schneiderman’s liberal leadership, saying “he was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.”

And, it appears, they weren’t alone: More women are now coming forward to detail similar allegations going back years. Apparently, his behavior wasn’t much of a secret in New York political circles.

But everyone looked the other way, rather than discredit a progressive Democratic hero. After all, Schneiderman had led the charge against Wall Street, against Donald Trump, against Exxon.

He’d also taken the lead in support of feminist causes, hailed by abortion-rights advocates as a “Champion of Choice” and filing suit against Harvey Weinstein’s company for allegedly covering up his years of “despicable” sexual harassment.

As one of his victims put it, Schneiderman championed women publicly but abused them privately.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE ( AP ) — Pope Francis on Tuesday publicly acknowledged the scandal of priests and bishops sexually abusing nuns and vowed to do more to fight the problem , the latest sign that there is no end in sight to the Catholic Church ’ s abuse crisis — and that it now has a reckoning from the # MeToo movement .
Francis admitted to the problem for the first time in public during a news conference while returning to Rome from the United Arab Emirates . The acknowledgment comes just two weeks before he hosts an unprecedented gathering of bishops to craft a global response to the scandal of priestly predators who target children and the superiors who covered up the crimes .
Francis was asked about priests who target adult women — the religious sisters who are the backbone of the Catholic Church ’ s education , health care and social service ministries around the globe — and whether the Holy See might consider a similar universal approach to combat that issue .
“ It ’ s not that everyone does this , but there have been priests and bishops who have , ” Francis told reporters . “ And I think that it ’ s continuing because it ’ s not like once you realize it that it stops . It continues . And for some time we ’ ve been working on it . ”
“ Should we do something more ? Yes . Is there the will ? Yes . But it ’ s a path that we have already begun , ” Francis said .
The issue has come to the fore amid the Catholic Church ’ s overall reckoning with the sexual abuse of minors and the # MeToo-inspired acknowledgement that adults can be victims of abuse whenever there is an imbalance of power in a relationship . In the past year , The ███ and other media have reported on cases of abused nuns in India , Africa , Europe and South America — evidence that the problem is by no means limited to a certain geographic area .
In November , the organization representing all the world ’ s female Catholic religious orders , the International Union of Superiors General , publicly denounced the “ culture of silence and secrecy ” that prevented nuns from speaking out and urged sisters to report abuse to their superiors and police . And just last week , the women ’ s magazine of the Vatican newspaper L ’ Osservatore Romano identified the clerical culture of the all-powerful clergy as the culprit .
The magazine , “ Women Church World , ” noted that the scandal involves a corollary : nuns being forced to abort the priests ’ children or bear children that the priests refuse to recognize .
Francis ’ acknowledgement of the problem comes as he prepares to decide the fate of the disgraced American ex-cardinal , Theodore McCarrick , who is accused of abusing minors as well as adult seminarians . That case also cast a spotlight on the issue of abusive power relationships , and whether the Catholic Church ought to consider seminarians and sisters as “ vulnerable adults ” when compared to the priests and bishops who control everything from their vocations to their studies and salaries .
Francis noted that Pope Benedict XVI had taken action against a France-based order that admitted the priest who founded it had violated his chastity vows with his female recruits . Francis said the sisters had been reduced to “ sexual slavery ” at the hands of the Rev . Marie-Dominique Philippe and other priests .
The Community of St. Jean admitted in 2013 that Philippe had behaved “ in ways that went against chastity ” with several women in the order , according to the French Catholic newspaper La Croix . Francis ’ comments about “ sexual slavery ” suggested that the relations were not consensual and could have involved abuse of conscience and power as well .
Phillipe died in 2006 . Three years later , the local bishop imposed a new superior on the order ’ s contemplative branch of nuns .

Dated but relevant : “ [ Another ] big change limits the department to holding schools accountable only when they are ‘ deliberately indifferent ’ to sexual harassment . That ’ s great news for schools ’ lawyers and terrible news for students… “ Consider the case of Jane Doe , a ninth grader who was raped by her classmate , then taunted mercilessly by him and his friends . The school ’ s sole response was to tell her to drop out and enroll in an ‘ alternative ’ school for poor-performing students . When the student sued , a judge held that the school ’ s response wasn ’ t bad enough to hold it liable under a deliberate-indifference standard . Though school employees ‘ could also have attempted to discipline the harassers , ’ the judge wrote , the decision to offer her a choice at an alternative school ‘ does not render them deliberately indifferent ’ to her plight. ” Dana Bolger , New York Times
“ ‘ Title IX was enacted to ensure that sex discrimination , including sexual harassment , would never be the end of anyone ’ s education , ’ [ Shiwali Patel , the director of Justice for Student Survivors and senior counsel at the National Women ’ s Law Center ] told Vox . But the change to the definition of harassment could mean that students would not have grounds for a complaint until they were essentially being driven out of a class or school because of it . ‘ It shouldn ’ t rise to that level before a school would have to take any action , ’ Patel said. ” Anna North , Vox
“ Experts in sexual violence have amassed considerable evidence that cross-examination in a live hearing can re-traumatize survivors and further deter survivors from reporting sexual misconduct . Research has also shown that aggressive , adversarial questioning is a poor tool for assessing the truth in cases of sexual violence … [ There are ] innovations that balance the rights and interests of both parties… “ The best of these procedures rely on the expertise and specialized training of investigators who understand the trauma of sexual violence . Questions are funneled through an impartial intermediary who has the capacity to omit impermissible questions or revise a question ’ s format . Students have the opportunity to contest findings , and both parties have the right to appeal… If there are ways to investigate and resolve complaints that are better at establishing fact and that prevent the re-traumatization likely with cross-examination , schools have the responsibility under Title IX to create such procedures . The Education Department regulations deprive schools of the capacity to innovate those solutions. ” Sandra R. Levitsky , Elizabeth A. Armstrong and Kamaria Porter , Washington Post
“ The changes coming might seem radical — if you were living in , say , pre-Magna Carta serfdom or under the jurisdiction of a particularly officious agent of the Spanish Inquisition . For 21st-century Americans , the right to question witnesses and accusers and to have an opportunity to evaluate the evidence presented against you should be the most obvious and unobjectionable thing in the world , but it isn ’ t — not on college campuses . And so thanks are due to Betsy DeVos…
“ But there is the deeper question of why campus proceedings are appropriate at all to handle matters of sexual assault… Sexual assault is not a matter of the campus honor code — it is a question of serious criminal misconduct . Where police departments and prosecutors are negligent or incompetent , as they sometimes show themselves to be in these matters , then that is an occasion for reforming the police departments and prosecutors ’ offices — not for handing over law-enforcement duties to professors and college administrators . ”
“ The most recent survey of due process protections at U.S. News ’ s top 53 national universities by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education determined that 72 % of them—including Georgetown and Caltech—didn ’ t explicitly tell accused students that they are presumed innocent until proven guilty .

Dated but relevant: “[Another] big change limits the department to holding schools accountable only when they are ‘deliberately indifferent’ to sexual harassment. That’s great news for schools’ lawyers and terrible news for students… “Consider the case of Jane Doe, a ninth grader who was raped by her classmate, then taunted mercilessly by him and his friends. The school’s sole response was to tell her to drop out and enroll in an ‘alternative’ school for poor-performing students. When the student sued, a judge held that the school’s response wasn’t bad enough to hold it liable under a deliberate-indifference standard . Though school employees ‘could also have attempted to discipline the harassers,’ the judge wrote, the decision to offer her a choice at an alternative school ‘does not render them deliberately indifferent’ to her plight.” Dana Bolger, New York Times

“‘Title IX was enacted to ensure that sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, would never be the end of anyone’s education,’ [Shiwali Patel, the director of Justice for Student Survivors and senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center] told Vox. But the change to the definition of harassment could mean that students would not have grounds for a complaint until they were essentially being driven out of a class or school because of it . ‘It shouldn’t rise to that level before a school would have to take any action,’ Patel said.” Anna North, Vox

“Experts in sexual violence have amassed considerable evidence that cross-examination in a live hearing can re-traumatize survivors and further deter survivors from reporting sexual misconduct. Research has also shown that aggressive, adversarial questioning is a poor tool for assessing the truth in cases of sexual violence … [There are] innovations that balance the rights and interests of both parties… “The best of these procedures rely on the expertise and specialized training of investigators who understand the trauma of sexual violence. Questions are funneled through an impartial intermediary who has the capacity to omit impermissible questions or revise a question’s format. Students have the opportunity to contest findings, and both parties have the right to appeal… If there are ways to investigate and resolve complaints that are better at establishing fact and that prevent the re-traumatization likely with cross-examination, schools have the responsibility under Title IX to create such procedures. The Education Department regulations deprive schools of the capacity to innovate those solutions.” Sandra R. Levitsky, Elizabeth A. Armstrong and Kamaria Porter, Washington Post

From the Right

The right supports the new regulations.

The right supports the new regulations.

“The changes coming might seem radical — if you were living in, say, pre-Magna Carta serfdom or under the jurisdiction of a particularly officious agent of the Spanish Inquisition. For 21st-century Americans, the right to question witnesses and accusers and to have an opportunity to evaluate the evidence presented against you should be the most obvious and unobjectionable thing in the world, but it isn’t — not on college campuses. And so thanks are due to Betsy DeVos…



“But there is the deeper question of why campus proceedings are appropriate at all to handle matters of sexual assault… Sexual assault is not a matter of the campus honor code — it is a question of serious criminal misconduct. Where police departments and prosecutors are negligent or incompetent, as they sometimes show themselves to be in these matters, then that is an occasion for reforming the police departments and prosecutors’ offices — not for handing over law-enforcement duties to professors and college administrators.”

The Editors, National Review

“The most recent survey of due process protections at U.S. News’s top 53 national universities by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education determined that 72% of them—including Georgetown and Caltech—didn’t explicitly tell accused students that they are presumed innocent until proven guilty. The new rules will correct this abuse… More than 40% of top colleges don’t even specify that their equivalents of judges and juries must be impartial. This madness will end when the rules take effect…



“The department relies on the Supreme Court’s standard from Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999) to advance a fair definition of student-on-student sexual harassment… This is a substantial improvement over the current patchwork of rules, which invite censorship of speech or behavior that is both constitutionally protected and not harassment. In Title IX’s name, colleges over the years have banned what they characterize as ‘derogatory cartoons,’ ‘innuendo’ and ‘sexually suggestive statues.’ Students and professors’ political, academic and artistic speech deserves protection.”

Robert Shibley, Wall Street Journal

“The previous Obama-era rules placed heavy financial incentives on colleges and universities to set up systems that shifted the burden of proof from accuser to the accused… Hundreds if not thousands of college students had their reputations ruined in kangaroo courts without any benefit of due process, or in many cases even an ability to present evidence on their own behalf or question witnesses.

US casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) amid sexual harassment allegations.

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him.

Mr Wynn has denied wrongdoing, calling the stories ""preposterous"".

RNC chair Ronna McDaniel told US media she had accepted his resignation.

Mr Wynn has blamed his ex-wife, whom he is fighting in court, for the ""slander"".

""The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit,"" the billionaire said in a statement that his public relations team sent to the BBC on Friday.

What he is accused of

According to the Wall Street Journal, which said it had interviewed dozens of people who worked with Mr Wynn, he is accused of engaging in a pattern of abuse in which he often harassed massage therapists while alone in his private office.

The gambling industry giant paid $7.5m (£5.2m) to one manicurist who alleged she had been forced into sex by Mr Wynn, the paper claims citing court documents.

Female employees would fake appointments in order to avoid seeing him, or enlist others to pretend to be their assistants in order to avoid being alone with him.

Some would even hide in bathrooms or closets if they heard he was coming to their salon, the paper claimed.

Democrats attack Republican 'silence'

Mr Wynn is also a Republican Party donor and fundraiser.

After harassment allegations were made against Hollywood executive producer Harvey Weinstein last year, Ms McDaniel and other leading Republicans called for the Democratic Party to return his donations.

Now some Democrats are asking if the same rules should apply regarding allegations against Mr Wynn.

The Democratic National Committee has attacked the RNC for remaining silent.

In an October statement, Ms McDaniel wrote: ""If Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no brainer.""

And She’s Had A Difficult Time Getting A Hearing.,,Rosie Gray,"Reade , who has alleged Joe Biden assaulted her in 1993 , believes the media is applying a double standard to her story and Democrats aren ’ t taking her seriously .
Max Whittaker / The New York Times via Redux Tara Reade , a former aide to Joe Biden , April 11 .
She has seen Joe Biden take questions on cable news and late-night television . She has seen him host virtual town halls with voters and online fundraisers with donors . And from her home in California , where she is keeping a daily watch on Twitter , Tara Reade has been waiting for someone — anyone — to ask the former vice president about her story . “ He was on television twice today . No one asked him . No one ’ s asking the question , ” Reade said in a phone interview earlier this month . “ No one ’ s even posing the question. ” On that particular day , Biden sat for an interview with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC ’ s Morning Joe , appeared on a CNN coronavirus town hall with Anderson Cooper , and took questions during a 45-minute fundraiser with dozens of donors . More than a month after Reade first detailed a serious allegation of sexual assault , Biden is set to address the subject in a Morning Joe interview scheduled for Friday morning . For weeks , he didn ’ t receive a question about the claims , despite doing multiple interviews . Reade , who has fielded dozens of requests from reporters this month , said she is acutely aware that her allegations pose complex terrain for the “ mainstream media ’ s ” coverage of a Democratic Party that has long viewed both Biden as a beloved figure and President Donald Trump as a man accused of sexism and more than a dozen instances of sexual harassment and assault . As Democrats came to Biden ’ s defense this month as an advocate for women — marking a turn for a party that has embraced the notion of “ believing women ” as a baseline posture in the # MeToo era — Reade said she believes her story has been given short shrift compared to other accusations of sexual abuse against powerful figures . She named as an example Christine Blasey Ford , the woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , then Trump ’ s nominee to the court . After seeing her story refracted through the lens of Political Twitter , Reade said in a series of interviews this month she ’ s felt “ marginalized , ” “ smeared , ” and “ discounted ” — betrayed by Democrats she said she once admired . “ It was really devastating when [ Kirsten ] Gillibrand and Stacey Abrams and Hillary Clinton , all on the same day , just basically implied my story was n't true and they believe Joe Biden . I can ’ t describe to you what that felt like , ” Reade said on Thursday , describing herself as a “ lifelong Democrat ” and in particular a fan of Abrams ' , the former Georgia House minority leader who has been campaigning to serve on the ticket with Biden as his vice presidential nominee . “ I just— I ’ m stunned , ” Reade said . “ They did n't just say , ‘ Oh , we 're standing with Joe Biden until we hear more. ’ They just discounted me . They marginalized me . They said they did n't believe me . I ca n't tell you , ” Reade said , trailing off . “ I cried for a while because they 're important in my life . They 've been figures that I looked up to . ”
At points over the last month , Reade has been scrutinized as much as her allegations . Some Democrats have pointed to her pro–Bernie Sanders tweets ( “ Bernie stay in ! ” she tweeted in late March ) , her writings praising Vladimir Putin ( she told ███ earlier this month that she had changed her views about Putin after reading writers like Julia Ioffe and Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny ) , and her decision to first seek a platform for her story on left-wing media outlets like Katie Halper ’ s podcast ( “ She 's very trauma-informed , ” she says of Halper ) as markers of her credibility . Reade , a 56-year-old who says she put herself through law school as a single mother and still has hundreds of thousands of dollars in student and medical debt , says she is not ashamed to identify herself as “ a working-class poor person. ” She has followed the online discussion , political and academic , over the ways in which survivors are received in the public square . “ I am not an ‘ imperfect victim , ’ ” Reade tweeted on Tuesday . Reade has accused Biden of digitally penetrating her in a Senate hallway when she was a staff assistant in his Senate office in 1993 . She has said she filed a Senate personnel report at the time , told others in the office about the incident , and was removed from her duty of overseeing the interns . The Biden campaign has said the incident did not happen . Three former Senate aides , all of whom Reade said she complained to directly at the time about the assault , have said they don ’ t remember any such complaint or that it did not take place . One of them , Biden ’ s former executive assistant from 1982 to 2000 , Marianne Baker , said in a statement provided by the campaign that she never once witnessed or heard of “ any reports of inappropriate conduct , period — not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone. ” Subsequent reporting has corroborated elements of Reade ’ s story . Former interns from the Senate office remember Reade being reassigned away from managing them , according to the New York Times . After Reade mentioned that her mother had called into Larry King Live , the Intercept published the transcript from a 1993 episode where a caller described her daughter ’ s negative experience with a “ prominent senator , ” though the caller does not detail the nature of the experience . Across different outlets , people who knew Reade have said she told them that she had had a bad experience with her boss in Washington — with varied levels of detail . In an interview with Business Insider , a former neighbor , Lynda LaCasse , said Reade detailed her full allegation against Biden in the 1990s . The New York Times and Washington Post each reported they spoke with an unnamed friend who had said Reade told her about the allegation in the 1990s as well . Others have provided more limited accounts — one friend told the Washington Post , for instance , that she remembered Reade saying Biden touched her arm and behaved inappropriately , but did not have other details . Reade ’ s brother initially told the Post he remembered her telling him that Biden was “ inappropriate , ” but followed up days later to clarify that he recalled Reade telling him that the then-senator had put his hands under her clothes .

If Democrats hope to hold themselves up as principled defenders of survivors ’ rights and fair process in the post-Kavanaugh era , they must establish a formal , unbiased investigation into Tara Reade ’ s allegations against Joe Biden , the presumptive Democratic nominee . Ad Policy
So far , they ’ ve fallen far short of this standard . When asked on April 30 about Reade ’ s allegations , Nancy Pelosi responded , “ There is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden. ” In so doing , Speaker Pelosi joins a long line of powerful individuals who have invoked “ due process ” and “ he ’ s a good good guy ” arguments to ensure that their political allies will avoid accountability and scrutiny .
When politicians and other powerful people strategically call for “ due process ” to defend their political allies , what they tend to mean is “ no process. ” This strategy has been wielded by liberals and conservatives alike—in schools , in workplaces , and in the media—to avoid confronting the possibility that someone they know , trust , or believe in may have perpetrated violence . It has also been used by powerful men themselves , like Harvey Weinstein , to try to avoid public criticism . Until Pelosi supports a framework through which Reade ’ s allegations can be given a fair hearing , it is hard to read her statements as anything but a disingenuous attempt to boost an ally , particularly as the evidence mounts corroborating Reade ’ s claim .
Pelosi isn ’ t the first to erroneously invoke the legal right to due process . As Alexandra Brodsky has written , this constitutional guarantee is a far cry from the baseless notion that “ no one can be mad at you unless a judge has donned robes. ” The right to due process arises when the state threatens to take away a right to which the accused person is normally entitled . This includes instances where someone faces prison time for an alleged crime or the possibility of a court order that limits where they can physically go as the result of an alleged assault . Further , the extent of the process due depends on the gravity of the right at stake . The fact that a fair investigation may expose Biden to public shame and potential repudiation does not implicate his due process rights .
Cynical invocations of due process are familiar to survivors . Take , for example , the modern movement against sexual assault on campuses . In the 2010s , survivors of sexual violence organized on campuses across the country to demand action from their schools and the Department of Education after their reports of assault and abuse were routinely swept under the rug . This led to critical but incremental change : In 2011 , the department released a Dear Colleague letter , a nonbinding piece of federal guidance that clarified for schools that Title IX ’ s prohibition on sex discrimination means institutions must respond fairly and promptly to allegations of sexual misconduct . But even the mere prospect of accountability activated a backlash from men ’ s rights advocates invoking due process to stack the procedural deck in favor of students accused of sexual misconduct . Related Articles I Believe Tara Reade . And You Should , Too . Kate Manne The Troublesome Tara Reade Story Joan Walsh
Thanks in part to this backlash , student survivors continue to face a bleak reality . Survivors have been forced out of school , been punished for being raped or speaking out , lost thousands of dollars , died by suicide , and been killed by intimate partners after their schools refused to take action to keep them safe . But despite these alarming outcomes , Betsy DeVos and her Department of Education have cynically invoked due process as a justification to give the once-fringe voices of men ’ s rights groups an unprecedented platform in her proposed Title IX rule , one that Biden himself has publicly denounced .

If Democrats hope to hold themselves up as principled defenders of survivors’ rights and fair process in the post-Kavanaugh era, they must establish a formal, unbiased investigation into Tara Reade’s allegations against Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Ad Policy

So far, they’ve fallen far short of this standard. When asked on April 30 about Reade’s allegations, Nancy Pelosi responded, “There is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.” In so doing, Speaker Pelosi joins a long line of powerful individuals who have invoked “due process” and “he’s a good good guy” arguments to ensure that their political allies will avoid accountability and scrutiny.

When politicians and other powerful people strategically call for “due process” to defend their political allies, what they tend to mean is “no process.” This strategy has been wielded by liberals and conservatives alike—in schools, in workplaces, and in the media—to avoid confronting the possibility that someone they know, trust, or believe in may have perpetrated violence. It has also been used by powerful men themselves, like Harvey Weinstein, to try to avoid public criticism. Until Pelosi supports a framework through which Reade’s allegations can be given a fair hearing, it is hard to read her statements as anything but a disingenuous attempt to boost an ally, particularly as the evidence mounts corroborating Reade’s claim.

Pelosi isn’t the first to erroneously invoke the legal right to due process. As Alexandra Brodsky has written, this constitutional guarantee is a far cry from the baseless notion that “no one can be mad at you unless a judge has donned robes.” The right to due process arises when the state threatens to take away a right to which the accused person is normally entitled. This includes instances where someone faces prison time for an alleged crime or the possibility of a court order that limits where they can physically go as the result of an alleged assault. Further, the extent of the process due depends on the gravity of the right at stake. The fact that a fair investigation may expose Biden to public shame and potential repudiation does not implicate his due process rights.

Cynical invocations of due process are familiar to survivors. Take, for example, the modern movement against sexual assault on campuses. In the 2010s, survivors of sexual violence organized on campuses across the country to demand action from their schools and the Department of Education after their reports of assault and abuse were routinely swept under the rug. This led to critical but incremental change: In 2011, the department released a Dear Colleague letter, a nonbinding piece of federal guidance that clarified for schools that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination means institutions must respond fairly and promptly to allegations of sexual misconduct. But even the mere prospect of accountability activated a backlash from men’s rights advocates invoking due process to stack the procedural deck in favor of students accused of sexual misconduct.

Thanks in part to this backlash, student survivors continue to face a bleak reality. Survivors have been forced out of school, been punished for being raped or speaking out, lost thousands of dollars, died by suicide, and been killed by intimate partners after their schools refused to take action to keep them safe. But despite these alarming outcomes, Betsy DeVos and her Department of Education have cynically invoked due process as a justification to give the once-fringe voices of men’s rights groups an unprecedented platform in her proposed Title IX rule, one that Biden himself has publicly denounced. To campus survivors, then, Pelosi’s remarks deflecting accountability for Biden sound all too familiar.

So does her blithe assertion that “Joe Biden is Joe Biden,” which echoes the pervasive myth that men who do good—especially for women—can never cause harm. Other influential Democrats, including Kirsten Gillibrand and Stacey Abrams, have attempted to walk a careful line between supporting calls to “believe survivors” and tamping down calls for further scrutiny, claiming that The New York Times’ report and Biden’s legislative history eliminate the need for further investigation. Indeed, many of Biden’s defenders point to his work on the Violence Against Women Act, which was coauthored by Representative Louise Slaughter, though her contribution seems to slip the minds of many. This distorted thinking has long been used to protect ourselves from the sad reality that we all know, and probably care for, rapists, abusers, and harassers. Biden’s work on violence against women does not erase Reade’s allegations, or the multiple allegations by other women of unwanted touching, or his mistreatment of Anita Hill in Clarence Thomas’s 1992 confirmation hearing. If you do not believe us, ask any survivor in your life if their attacker has ever done something good. Indeed, many famous men whose sexual predation has been revealed by the #MeToo movement have made notable contributions to society. That does not lessen their harm.

Unsurprisingly, the burden of responding to these allegations seems to have fallen squarely on the shoulders of Democratic women, as has repeatedly happened in such cases—notably in the party’s response to the allegations against Al Franken (whose resignation Gillibrand promptly called for in 2017). While some congressional Democrats have acknowledged that accusations of this kind are worthy of inquiry, they have failed to call for a formal investigation into Reade’s charges.

sexual_misconduct,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/4/17924900/poll-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh,"Exclusive: we re-ran polls from 1991 about Anita Hill, this time about Christine Blasey Ford",2018-10-04,Dylan Matthews,"In 1991 , 67 percent of Americans surveyed told pollsters that if Anita Hill ’ s accusation of sexual harassment was true , it should sink Clarence Thomas ’ s nomination to the Supreme Court . Twenty-seven years later , a nearly identical percentage , 69 percent , of Americans said that if Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusation of sexual assault was true , it should sink Brett Kavanaugh ’ s .
After nearly three decades , Americans aren ’ t taking accusations of sexual misconduct by potential Supreme Court justices more seriously . “ The public has not moved on that one in 27 years , ” concluded Barry Burden , a University of Wisconsin Madison political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center .
That ’ s one of the findings from a new poll produced in partnership between ███ and the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin , with data gathered by YouGov .
Between September 29 and October 1 , the survey asked Americans six questions identical to the ones that pollsters fielded in the days after Hill ’ s Senate Judiciary Committee testimony . The only changes to the questions were the names — Ford ’ s was substituted for Hill ’ s and Kavanaugh ’ s for Thomas ’ s . ( Both Thomas and Kavanaugh have denied the allegations against them . )
The survey aimed to gauge how much attitudes have changed ( or not changed ) about sexual misconduct allegations against Court nominees and to what extent those attitudes are shaping political opinions .
While more than two-thirds of Americans then and now say they disapprove of a man found to have engaged in sexual harassment or assault on the high court , there are significant differences from 1991 . The political stakes appear higher . Unlike President George H.W . Bush , who wasn ’ t penalized by voters for tapping Thomas , President Donald Trump has paid a price . About 42 percent of respondents say they ’ ve lost confidence in Trump because of his choice of Kavanaugh , while only 30 percent lost confidence in H.W . Bush ( the same share as those who gained confidence in him ) .
The Hill-Thomas hearings took place a year before a midterm election , unlike the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings , which took place five weeks before Election Day . It ’ s harder to draw a comparison , given the timing of the polls . But we know that the current survey suggests that senators who support Kavanaugh are most likely to be rewarded by voters .
███ and the Elections Research Center tried as best we could to copy the exact wording of the poll questions we replicated . But because YouGov is an online polling company , and most of the Thomas/Hill polls we replicated were conducted by phone , there is a significant difference . The phone polls enabled respondents to say they were “ not sure ” or “ didn ’ t know , ” an option that doesn ’ t exist on YouGov ’ s web platform . Our poll reached 1,000 Americans , and the results were weighted by race , age , gender , education , and 2016 presidential vote to enhance their representativeness .
To ensure as close a comparison as possible , Burden from the Elections Research Center , recalculated all the early 1990s polling with “ not sure ” responses excluded . Unless otherwise indicated , those are the numbers reported in this article .
Question 1 : “ All in all , do you approve or disapprove of the way the Senate handled the confirmation hearings ? ”
The public ’ s view of national politicians appears dimmer now , and public attitude toward the Kavanaugh hearings is slightly more negative than toward the Thomas hearings .
In an October 1991 CBS News/New York Times poll , 68 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way that the Senate had handled the Thomas confirmation hearings ; only 32 percent approved .
Our poll found that 73 percent of respondents disapproved of the Senate ’ s handling of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings , and 27 percent approved . The change was statistically significant . For the stats enthusiasts out there , the p-value for the difference between 1991 and 2018 is under 0.05 , as determined by chi-squared test ( for more on what that means , this piece by ███ ’ s Brian Resnick is a great primer ) .
Question 2 : “ As a result of the hearings , do you have more confidence or less confidence in the president ? ”
While the Thomas hearings didn ’ t appear to hurt approval for H.W . Bush at all , the Kavanaugh hearings have had a significant negative effect on our respondents ’ views of Trump .
A 1991 poll from Gallup and CNN found that 30 percent of respondents said the Thomas hearings reduced their confidence in President Bush ; 36 percent said their confidence level was unchanged ; and 34 percent said they were more confident in the president as a result .
By contrast , we found that 42 percent of respondents say the Kavanaugh hearings have reduced their confidence in President Trump — 12 points more than the equivalent for Bush/Thomas . Smaller shares than in 1991 say they are more confident in Trump as a result of the hearings ( 24 percent ) , or that their confidence level is unchanged ( 34 percent ) . ( The differences here are statistically significant at an even stricter ( p < 0.01 ) level . )
Question 3 : “ Do you think [ the nominee ] did or did not receive a fair hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee ? ”
While the hearings appear to have hurt Trump ’ s reputation , more people in 2018 feel that the embattled Supreme Court nominee failed to receive a fair hearing than thought the same in 1991 . In that limited way , Kavanaugh has elicited more sympathy than Thomas .
Democrats were much more likely ( 80 percent ) to say Kavanaugh got a fair hearing than independents ( 49 percent ) or Republicans ( 33 percent ) . Accordingly , young and nonwhite respondents were likelier to think the proceedings were fair , and older/white people were less likely .
An NBC News/Wall Street journal poll from October 1991 found that 67 percent of respondents thought Thomas had received a fair hearing in the Senate ; 33 percent disagreed . Our poll found that 55 percent of respondents think Kavanaugh has received a fair hearing , and 45 percent think he has not . The share who think the nominee got a raw deal has increased sharply , and the change is significant at a p < 0.01 level .
Question 4 : “ If one of your US senators voted in favor of confirming [ Kavanaugh/Thomas ] as a Supreme Court justice , would that make you more likely to vote to reelect that senator , less likely , or wouldn ’ t it make much difference in your vote ? ”
Several months after the Thomas-Hill hearings , in June 1992 , ABC News and the Washington Post conducted a poll asking how the proceedings would affect voting behavior that fall .
The poll suggested that the issue wouldn ’ t be a powerful motivator : 68 percent of respondents said that the issue “ wouldn ’ t make much difference ” in their Senate vote . Of those for whom it mattered , slightly more ( 20 percent ) took Hill ’ s side , saying that they ’ d be less likely to vote for a senator who backed Thomas , while only 11 percent said they ’ d be more likely to vote for a senator who backed Thomas .
That 1992 poll took place months after the hearings , and months before Election Day . Our poll was conducted right in the wake of the hearings , and little more than a month before Election Day . But with those points of difference noted , we found a public that professes to care deeply about the Kavanaugh-Ford hearings — and would hold a vote for Kavanaugh against their senator .
A mere 28 percent of respondents in 2018 say that a senator ’ s vote for Kavanaugh wouldn ’ t matter to them ; that ’ s less than half the equivalent 1992 figure . 28 percent say a pro-Kavanaugh vote would make them likelier to support their senator , and 44 percent say that it would make them less likely . ( The differences from 1992 are statistically significant at a p < 0.01 level . )
The results , however , change markedly if you limit the results to people who voted in 2016 . “ Among people who voted in 2016 , the responses are 34 percent more likely , 44 percent less likely , and 22 percent wouldn ’ t make a difference , ” Burden said . “ Among those who didn ’ t vote , the responses are 10 percent more likely , 45 percent less likely , and 45 percent wouldn ’ t make a difference . ”
“ In other words , ” said Burden , “ voters are much more likely [ than non-voters ] to reward senators for supporting Kavanaugh . ”
Question 5 : “ If a candidate for Congress in your district opposed the nomination of [ Kavanaugh/Thomas ] to the US Supreme Court , would make you more likely or less likely to support this candidate ? ”
We were not able to find a poll asking in October 1991 , in the immediate aftermath of the Thomas-Hill hearings , how they would affect respondents ’ Senate votes .
But the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from October 1991 did ask about how the hearings could affect votes for the US House . The respondents didn ’ t share the indifference that ABC News/Washington Post found in June 1992 . Only 16 percent of respondents said that a candidate ’ s opposition to Thomas would “ not make much difference . ”
Thirty-three percent , in total , said that they were “ much more ” or “ somewhat more ” likely to support a candidate who opposed Thomas , while 51 percent said they were “ somewhat less ” or “ much less ” likely to support an anti-Thomas candidate .
Our 2018 follow-up found more indifference ( 25 percent said it wouldn ’ t make much difference for their House vote ) , but a similar tilt against anti-Kavanaugh candidates . 36 percent of respondents said that they ’ d be more likely to back a candidate who opposed Kavanaugh , and 39 percent said they ’ d be less likely . The difference between 1991 and 2018 is , once again , statistically significant with p < 0.01 .
As with the Senate results , this result changes significantly if the sample is restricted to voters . “ Among nonvoters , almost half ( 46 percent ) say that it wouldn ’ t make a difference . Among voters it ’ s only 19 percent , ” Burden said . “ The number of people saying it would make ‘ much more ’ difference is quite a bit larger among voters . The ‘ much more likely ’ group goes from 15 percent to 27 percent . The ‘ much less likely ’ goes from 15 percent to 31 percent . ”
The difference between this and the Senate polling is striking . In the Senate , support for Kavanaugh appears to significantly hurt candidates . In the House , opposition to Kavanaugh doesn ’ t appear to have much effect at all . That could reflect a sophisticated distinction drawn by voters between the importance of judicial views in the House , which doesn ’ t confirm nominees , and the Senate , which does .
Or it could reflect incoherent views and a lack of careful attention on the part of voters . The latter seems likelier to me , as the difference between the House and Senate polls isn ’ t driven by more people saying the issue doesn ’ t matter in the House . It ’ s driven by the pro- and anti-Kavanaugh sides being more evenly matched in the House than in the Senate .
And , of course , how people say they ’ re determining their vote can differ from their actual thought process . Generic ballot and district-specific polls are probably a better predictor of the midterm results in the House than issue-specific polls like this . But our polling at least provides some evidence that voters are thinking about Kavanaugh , whether or not the issue winds up swinging votes .
Question 6 : “ If the charge is true , would that be enough of a reason for the Senate to reject his nomination , or not ? ”
Polls by both YouGov and Quinnipiac have found that more Americans say they believe Ford ’ s allegations against Kavanaugh than say they believe Kavanaugh ’ s denials , though , predictably , Democrats are vastly more likely to believe Ford and Republicans are vastly more likely to believe Kavanaugh .
The ABC News poll from October 1991 , which we replicated , asked a narrower question : “ If the charge [ against Thomas/Kavanaugh ] is true , would that be enough of a reason for the Senate to reject his nomination , or not ? ”
The answer might seem obvious , but some of Kavanaugh ’ s defenders have argued that he should be confirmed — even if guilty . The understandably pseudonymous Federalist contributor Soren Midgley has argued that “ what we know about Kavanaugh ’ s record for the last 30 years of his life tells us the realized negative consequences would be minimal if he were actually guilty. ” Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle has gone further , stating , “ I would be cool with a teen murderer getting a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court . ”
Americans at large took a different stand in October 1991 , and take a mostly identical one today . In both cases , a minority of 31-33 percent say that the allegations , if true , shouldn ’ t disqualify Thomas/Kavanaugh from the court , while 67-69 percent argue they should .
It ’ s easy , especially in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and # MeToo , to assume that the American public takes allegations of sexual harassment and assault more seriously than it did decades ago . And some parts of our survey confirm that , especially the findings that American voters think less of Trump and of senators who support Kavanaugh .
But in the crucial matter of whether a true accusation of sexual assault is important enough to derail a nomination , things haven ’ t changed much since 1991 .
In part because of the demographic makeup of the parties , there are significant gaps based on age , race , and church attendance as well . Eighty-four percent of black respondents and 75 percent of Hispanic respondents say a true allegation is enough to reject , compared to 66 percent of whites . 78 percent of people between 18 and 30 said a true allegation would be enough , compared to 63 percent of people 66 or older .
And the less someone goes to church , the more likely they are to say a true allegation is enough . Seventy-eight percent of people who never go to church , and 76 percent of people who “ seldom ” go , say a true allegation is enough , compared to only 61 percent of weekly attendees .
“ It is the religiously conservative who are more tolerant of Kavanaugh possibly committing sexual assault and would still be willing to have him on the Court , ” Burden said .","In 1991, 67 percent of Americans surveyed told pollsters that if Anita Hill’s accusation of sexual harassment was true, it should sink Clarence Thomas’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Twenty-seven years later, a nearly identical percentage, 69 percent, of Americans said that if Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault was true, it should sink Brett Kavanaugh’s.

After nearly three decades, Americans aren’t taking accusations of sexual misconduct by potential Supreme Court justices more seriously. “The public has not moved on that one in 27 years,” concluded Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin Madison political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center.

That’s one of the findings from a new poll produced in partnership between Vox and the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, with data gathered by YouGov.

Between September 29 and October 1, the survey asked Americans six questions identical to the ones that pollsters fielded in the days after Hill’s Senate Judiciary Committee testimony. The only changes to the questions were the names — Ford’s was substituted for Hill’s and Kavanaugh’s for Thomas’s. (Both Thomas and Kavanaugh have denied the allegations against them.)

The survey aimed to gauge how much attitudes have changed (or not changed) about sexual misconduct allegations against Court nominees and to what extent those attitudes are shaping political opinions.

While more than two-thirds of Americans then and now say they disapprove of a man found to have engaged in sexual harassment or assault on the high court, there are significant differences from 1991. The political stakes appear higher. Unlike President George H.W. Bush, who wasn’t penalized by voters for tapping Thomas, President Donald Trump has paid a price. About 42 percent of respondents say they’ve lost confidence in Trump because of his choice of Kavanaugh, while only 30 percent lost confidence in H.W. Bush (the same share as those who gained confidence in him).

The Hill-Thomas hearings took place a year before a midterm election, unlike the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings, which took place five weeks before Election Day. It’s harder to draw a comparison, given the timing of the polls. But we know that the current survey suggests that senators who support Kavanaugh are most likely to be rewarded by voters.

We asked six questions from 1991/1992, again

Vox and the Elections Research Center tried as best we could to copy the exact wording of the poll questions we replicated. But because YouGov is an online polling company, and most of the Thomas/Hill polls we replicated were conducted by phone, there is a significant difference. The phone polls enabled respondents to say they were “not sure” or “didn’t know,” an option that doesn’t exist on YouGov’s web platform. Our poll reached 1,000 Americans, and the results were weighted by race, age, gender, education, and 2016 presidential vote to enhance their representativeness.

To ensure as close a comparison as possible, Burden from the Elections Research Center, recalculated all the early 1990s polling with “not sure” responses excluded. Unless otherwise indicated, those are the numbers reported in this article.

Question 1: “All in all, do you approve or disapprove of the way the Senate handled the confirmation hearings?”

The public’s view of national politicians appears dimmer now, and public attitude toward the Kavanaugh hearings is slightly more negative than toward the Thomas hearings.

In an October 1991 CBS News/New York Times poll, 68 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way that the Senate had handled the Thomas confirmation hearings; only 32 percent approved.

Our poll found that 73 percent of respondents disapproved of the Senate’s handling of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, and 27 percent approved. The change was statistically significant. For the stats enthusiasts out there, the p-value for the difference between 1991 and 2018 is under 0.05, as determined by chi-squared test (for more on what that means, this piece by Vox’s Brian Resnick is a great primer).

Question 2: “As a result of the hearings, do you have more confidence or less confidence in the president?”

While the Thomas hearings didn’t appear to hurt approval for H.W. Bush at all, the Kavanaugh hearings have had a significant negative effect on our respondents’ views of Trump.

A 1991 poll from Gallup and CNN found that 30 percent of respondents said the Thomas hearings reduced their confidence in President Bush; 36 percent said their confidence level was unchanged; and 34 percent said they were more confident in the president as a result.

By contrast, we found that 42 percent of respondents say the Kavanaugh hearings have reduced their confidence in President Trump — 12 points more than the equivalent for Bush/Thomas. Smaller shares than in 1991 say they are more confident in Trump as a result of the hearings (24 percent), or that their confidence level is unchanged (34 percent). (The differences here are statistically significant at an even stricter (p < 0.01) level.)

Question 3: “Do you think [the nominee] did or did not receive a fair hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee?”

While the hearings appear to have hurt Trump’s reputation, more people in 2018 feel that the embattled Supreme Court nominee failed to receive a fair hearing than thought the same in 1991. In that limited way, Kavanaugh has elicited more sympathy than Thomas.

Democrats were much more likely (80 percent) to say Kavanaugh got a fair hearing than independents (49 percent) or Republicans (33 percent). Accordingly, young and nonwhite respondents were likelier to think the proceedings were fair, and older/white people were less likely.

An NBC News/Wall Street journal poll from October 1991 found that 67 percent of respondents thought Thomas had received a fair hearing in the Senate; 33 percent disagreed. Our poll found that 55 percent of respondents think Kavanaugh has received a fair hearing, and 45 percent think he has not. The share who think the nominee got a raw deal has increased sharply, and the change is significant at a p < 0.01 level.

Question 4: “If one of your US senators voted in favor of confirming [Kavanaugh/Thomas] as a Supreme Court justice, would that make you more likely to vote to reelect that senator, less likely, or wouldn’t it make much difference in your vote?”

Several months after the Thomas-Hill hearings, in June 1992, ABC News and the Washington Post conducted a poll asking how the proceedings would affect voting behavior that fall.

The poll suggested that the issue wouldn’t be a powerful motivator: 68 percent of respondents said that the issue “wouldn’t make much difference” in their Senate vote. Of those for whom it mattered, slightly more (20 percent) took Hill’s side, saying that they’d be less likely to vote for a senator who backed Thomas, while only 11 percent said they’d be more likely to vote for a senator who backed Thomas.

That 1992 poll took place months after the hearings, and months before Election Day. Our poll was conducted right in the wake of the hearings, and little more than a month before Election Day. But with those points of difference noted, we found a public that professes to care deeply about the Kavanaugh-Ford hearings — and would hold a vote for Kavanaugh against their senator.

A mere 28 percent of respondents in 2018 say that a senator’s vote for Kavanaugh wouldn’t matter to them; that’s less than half the equivalent 1992 figure. 28 percent say a pro-Kavanaugh vote would make them likelier to support their senator, and 44 percent say that it would make them less likely. (The differences from 1992 are statistically significant at a p < 0.01 level.)

The results, however, change markedly if you limit the results to people who voted in 2016. “Among people who voted in 2016, the responses are 34 percent more likely, 44 percent less likely, and 22 percent wouldn’t make a difference,” Burden said. “Among those who didn’t vote, the responses are 10 percent more likely, 45 percent less likely, and 45 percent wouldn’t make a difference.”

“In other words,” said Burden, “voters are much more likely [than non-voters] to reward senators for supporting Kavanaugh.”

Question 5: “If a candidate for Congress in your district opposed the nomination of [Kavanaugh/Thomas] to the US Supreme Court, would make you more likely or less likely to support this candidate?”

We were not able to find a poll asking in October 1991, in the immediate aftermath of the Thomas-Hill hearings, how they would affect respondents’ Senate votes.

But the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from October 1991 did ask about how the hearings could affect votes for the US House. The respondents didn’t share the indifference that ABC News/Washington Post found in June 1992. Only 16 percent of respondents said that a candidate’s opposition to Thomas would “not make much difference.”

Thirty-three percent, in total, said that they were “much more” or “somewhat more” likely to support a candidate who opposed Thomas, while 51 percent said they were “somewhat less” or “much less” likely to support an anti-Thomas candidate.

Our 2018 follow-up found more indifference (25 percent said it wouldn’t make much difference for their House vote), but a similar tilt against anti-Kavanaugh candidates. 36 percent of respondents said that they’d be more likely to back a candidate who opposed Kavanaugh, and 39 percent said they’d be less likely. The difference between 1991 and 2018 is, once again, statistically significant with p < 0.01.

As with the Senate results, this result changes significantly if the sample is restricted to voters. “Among nonvoters, almost half (46 percent) say that it wouldn’t make a difference. Among voters it’s only 19 percent,” Burden said. “The number of people saying it would make ‘much more’ difference is quite a bit larger among voters. The ‘much more likely’ group goes from 15 percent to 27 percent. The ‘much less likely’ goes from 15 percent to 31 percent.”

The difference between this and the Senate polling is striking. In the Senate, support for Kavanaugh appears to significantly hurt candidates. In the House, opposition to Kavanaugh doesn’t appear to have much effect at all. That could reflect a sophisticated distinction drawn by voters between the importance of judicial views in the House, which doesn’t confirm nominees, and the Senate, which does.

Or it could reflect incoherent views and a lack of careful attention on the part of voters. The latter seems likelier to me, as the difference between the House and Senate polls isn’t driven by more people saying the issue doesn’t matter in the House. It’s driven by the pro- and anti-Kavanaugh sides being more evenly matched in the House than in the Senate.

And, of course, how people say they’re determining their vote can differ from their actual thought process. Generic ballot and district-specific polls are probably a better predictor of the midterm results in the House than issue-specific polls like this. But our polling at least provides some evidence that voters are thinking about Kavanaugh, whether or not the issue winds up swinging votes.

Question 6: “If the charge is true, would that be enough of a reason for the Senate to reject his nomination, or not?”

Polls by both YouGov and Quinnipiac have found that more Americans say they believe Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh than say they believe Kavanaugh’s denials, though, predictably, Democrats are vastly more likely to believe Ford and Republicans are vastly more likely to believe Kavanaugh.

The ABC News poll from October 1991, which we replicated, asked a narrower question: “If the charge [against Thomas/Kavanaugh] is true, would that be enough of a reason for the Senate to reject his nomination, or not?”

The answer might seem obvious, but some of Kavanaugh’s defenders have argued that he should be confirmed — even if guilty. The understandably pseudonymous Federalist contributor Soren Midgley has argued that “what we know about Kavanaugh’s record for the last 30 years of his life tells us the realized negative consequences would be minimal if he were actually guilty.” Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle has gone further, stating, “I would be cool with a teen murderer getting a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.”

Americans at large took a different stand in October 1991, and take a mostly identical one today. In both cases, a minority of 31-33 percent say that the allegations, if true, shouldn’t disqualify Thomas/Kavanaugh from the court, while 67-69 percent argue they should.

It’s easy, especially in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and #MeToo, to assume that the American public takes allegations of sexual harassment and assault more seriously than it did decades ago. And some parts of our survey confirm that, especially the findings that American voters think less of Trump and of senators who support Kavanaugh.

But in the crucial matter of whether a true accusation of sexual assault is important enough to derail a nomination, things haven’t changed much since 1991.

In part because of the demographic makeup of the parties, there are significant gaps based on age, race, and church attendance as well. Eighty-four percent of black respondents and 75 percent of Hispanic respondents say a true allegation is enough to reject, compared to 66 percent of whites. 78 percent of people between 18 and 30 said a true allegation would be enough, compared to 63 percent of people 66 or older.

And the less someone goes to church, the more likely they are to say a true allegation is enough. Seventy-eight percent of people who never go to church, and 76 percent of people who “seldom” go, say a true allegation is enough, compared to only 61 percent of weekly attendees.

“It is the religiously conservative who are more tolerant of Kavanaugh possibly committing sexual assault and would still be willing to have him on the Court,” Burden said.",www.vox.com,left,QMKo1RDu668hYQLX

Rep. John Conyers , D-Mich. , has announced he is stepping down as ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee . Conyers conveyed the news in a statement released Sunday by the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .
The announcement comes roughly a week after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced publicly against the longest-serving member of the House . Those allegations were lodged by a former female employee , who had made a wrongful dismissal complaint against him that was settled two years ago .
The House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into the incident . Conyers continues to deny the allegations of wrongdoing and says he has no intention of resigning his seat in the House .
`` After careful consideration and In light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me , I have notified the Democratic Leader of my request to step aside as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee during the investigation of these matters , '' Conyers said in the statement .
`` I deny these allegations , many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger . I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics . ''
Last week , NPR 's Susan Davis explained the allegations swirling around Conyers :
`` Rep. John Conyers , D-Mich. , settled a wrongful dismissal complaint two years ago with a former female employee who alleged Conyers made repeated sexual advances toward female staff , according to BuzzFeed . ... `` Buzzfeed obtained signed affidavits , three of which are notarized and verified the documents with four people involved in the matter who confirmed their authenticity . The woman was paid over $ 27,000 as part of a confidentiality agreement . The money came out of Conyers ' office budget , which is taxpayer-funded . ''
Speaking earlier Sunday on NBC 's Meet the Press , Pelosi had refrained from calling for Conyers ' outright resignation , saying the longtime congressman is an `` icon in our country '' and asking for patience for his investigation to unfold .
`` He will do the right thing in terms of what he knows about his situation , '' she said . `` He 's entitled to due process , but women are entitled to due process , as well . ''
According to a senior Democratic aide , Pelosi had spent the last few days working with Conyers and other Congressional Black Caucus members on how to `` lay groundwork for him to step aside gracefully . ''
Later Sunday in a tweeted statement , Pelosi added : `` Zero tolerance means consequences . ''
`` As a woman and mother of four daughters , I partcularly take any accusation of sexual harassment very seriously , '' she said . `` Any credible accusation must be reviewed by the Ethics Committee expeditiously . We are at a watershed moment on this issue , and no matter how great an individual 's legacy , it is not license for harassment . ''
Politicians on both sides of the aisle have faced sexual misconduct allegations in recent weeks .
Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota , who has been accused of inappropriately touching several women , has been dealing with a Senate ethics investigation of his own . On Thursday , Franken issued an apology without confirming the most recent allegations lodged against him .
`` I 'm a warm person ; I hug people . I 've learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters , I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many . Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate , and I respect their feelings about that , '' Franken said .

Updated at 4:34 p.m. ET

Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., has announced he is stepping down as ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Conyers conveyed the news in a statement released Sunday by the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

The announcement comes roughly a week after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced publicly against the longest-serving member of the House. Those allegations were lodged by a former female employee, who had made a wrongful dismissal complaint against him that was settled two years ago.

The House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into the incident. Conyers continues to deny the allegations of wrongdoing and says he has no intention of resigning his seat in the House.

""After careful consideration and In light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me, I have notified the Democratic Leader of my request to step aside as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee during the investigation of these matters,"" Conyers said in the statement.

""I deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger. I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics.""

Last week, NPR's Susan Davis explained the allegations swirling around Conyers:

""Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., settled a wrongful dismissal complaint two years ago with a former female employee who alleged Conyers made repeated sexual advances toward female staff, according to BuzzFeed. ... ""Buzzfeed obtained signed affidavits, three of which are notarized and verified the documents with four people involved in the matter who confirmed their authenticity. The woman was paid over $27,000 as part of a confidentiality agreement. The money came out of Conyers' office budget, which is taxpayer-funded.""

Speaking earlier Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Pelosi had refrained from calling for Conyers' outright resignation, saying the longtime congressman is an ""icon in our country"" and asking for patience for his investigation to unfold.

""He will do the right thing in terms of what he knows about his situation,"" she said. ""He's entitled to due process, but women are entitled to due process, as well.""

According to a senior Democratic aide, Pelosi had spent the last few days working with Conyers and other Congressional Black Caucus members on how to ""lay groundwork for him to step aside gracefully.""

Later Sunday in a tweeted statement, Pelosi added: ""Zero tolerance means consequences.""

""As a woman and mother of four daughters, I partcularly take any accusation of sexual harassment very seriously,"" she said. ""Any credible accusation must be reviewed by the Ethics Committee expeditiously. We are at a watershed moment on this issue, and no matter how great an individual's legacy, it is not license for harassment.""

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have faced sexual misconduct allegations in recent weeks.

Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, who has been accused of inappropriately touching several women, has been dealing with a Senate ethics investigation of his own. On Thursday, Franken issued an apology without confirming the most recent allegations lodged against him.

""I'm a warm person; I hug people. I've learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many. Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate, and I respect their feelings about that,"" Franken said.

""I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again,"" he added. ""And let me say again to Minnesotans that I'm sorry for putting them through this and I'm committed to regaining their trust.""

On Sunday, Franken told Minnesota Public Radio News he has not considered resigning, however.

Meanwhile, Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, continues to vehemently deny the allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Moore has hemorrhaged support from within his own national party in recent weeks, though one prominent Republican appears to be sticking by him: President Trump.

""Liberal Jones would be BAD!"" Trump tweeted Sunday about Moore's Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. And prior to leaving the White House for Thanksgiving last week, Trump, who faces sexual misconduct allegations of his own, told reporters Moore ""totally denies"" sexually assaulting multiple teenagers when Moore was in his 30s.",www.npr.org,center,XqV2meVcuyXNFX0N

sexual_misconduct,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/26/bill-cosby-guilty-verdict-what-happens-next/554838002/,"After a guilty verdict, what happens next for Bill Cosby?",2018-04-26,,"The jury in Bill Cosby 's retrial found him guilty of aggravated assault Thursday after about 12 hours of deliberation .
His conviction on all three counts means they determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the comedian molested Temple University staffer Andrea Constand during a visit to his Philadelphia-area home in 2004 , despite the fact that she could not consent because the pills he gave her rendered her unconscious .
But now that the verdict is in , what happens next ? Here 's what we know :
Cosby is not going to jail — at least not yet .
Judge Steven O'Neill allowed the comedian , who had already posted a $ 1 million bond , to remain free on bail until his sentencing , to the frustration of prosecutors .
On Friday , O'Neill said sentencing could take place in 75 days . He ordered Cosby to undergo a `` sexually violent predator '' assessment before sentencing . And he clarified that Cosby will be restricted to house arrest , will have to wear a GPS monitor , and can leave his home only to visit his doctors or lawyers within a five-county area .
`` It 's supposed to happen within 90 days ( of conviction ) but if all the parties agree it happens after that , it 's fine , '' says Brian Zeiger , a defense lawyer who tries cases in Montgomery County , Pa. , and the neighboring Philadelphia and Bucks counties .
Michael Donio , a retired New Jersey superior court judge , says the next legal battle will be at sentencing . If Cosby is sentenced to prison , he 'd go directly behind bars . However , Donio expects his lawyers to argue he should be out on bond during the appeal . Such a request , he said , is usually not granted .
Cosby , who is 80 , blind and in declining health , was convicted on three counts , each carrying up to 10 years in prison , so any jail time could mean he 'd end up dying behind bars .
According to state law , O'Neill can sentence Cosby to either a consecutive prison term ( i.e. , back-to-back terms ) or concurrent ones , meaning he would serve them all at the same time , with the longest term determining the duration of his prison stay .
`` I would think that it would be a concurrent situation , '' says Zeiger , who has tried numerous sex-offense cases . In his experience , whether a defendant gets concurrent sentencing `` depends on the judge and the number of victims . In this case , they only proceeded with one . But I think they would also consider his age . ''
Fellow Philadelphia-area defense attorney Steven Fairlie says Cosby is likely to get a concurrent sentence because the charges all stem from the same crime .
But Fairlie also points out that possible victim testimony at the sentencing hearing and Cosby ’ s outburst following the guilty verdict — Cosby shouted vulgarities at Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele — could lead the judge to consider a harsher sentence of up to 10 years .
“ Hurling insults at the district attorney is not going to help his case , ” he says .
The length of Cosby 's sentence will determine where he serves time .
Zeiger says that if Cosby 's sentence is less than one or two years , he 'll likely serve it at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Eagleville , Pa. , or through house arrest . He discounts the possibility of work release , citing Cosby 's age .
`` If it 's one to two years or more , he would go into the state system in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , '' he says , `` and then the trial court would lose jurisdiction over his custody . ''

USA TODAY

The jury in Bill Cosby's retrial found him guilty of aggravated assault Thursday after about 12 hours of deliberation.

His conviction on all three counts means they determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the comedian molested Temple University staffer Andrea Constand during a visit to his Philadelphia-area home in 2004, despite the fact that she could not consent because the pills he gave her rendered her unconscious.

But now that the verdict is in, what happens next? Here's what we know:

Cosby is not going to jail — at least not yet.

Judge Steven O'Neill allowed the comedian, who had already posted a $1 million bond, to remain free on bail until his sentencing, to the frustration of prosecutors.

On Friday, O'Neill said sentencing could take place in 75 days. He ordered Cosby to undergo a ""sexually violent predator"" assessment before sentencing. And he clarified that Cosby will be restricted to house arrest, will have to wear a GPS monitor, and can leave his home only to visit his doctors or lawyers within a five-county area.

""It's supposed to happen within 90 days (of conviction) but if all the parties agree it happens after that, it's fine,"" says Brian Zeiger, a defense lawyer who tries cases in Montgomery County, Pa., and the neighboring Philadelphia and Bucks counties.

Michael Donio, a retired New Jersey superior court judge, says the next legal battle will be at sentencing. If Cosby is sentenced to prison, he'd go directly behind bars. However, Donio expects his lawyers to argue he should be out on bond during the appeal. Such a request, he said, is usually not granted.

How much time might he serve?

Cosby, who is 80, blind and in declining health, was convicted on three counts, each carrying up to 10 years in prison, so any jail time could mean he'd end up dying behind bars.

According to state law, O'Neill can sentence Cosby to either a consecutive prison term (i.e., back-to-back terms) or concurrent ones, meaning he would serve them all at the same time, with the longest term determining the duration of his prison stay.

""I would think that it would be a concurrent situation,"" says Zeiger, who has tried numerous sex-offense cases. In his experience, whether a defendant gets concurrent sentencing ""depends on the judge and the number of victims. In this case, they only proceeded with one. But I think they would also consider his age.""

Fellow Philadelphia-area defense attorney Steven Fairlie says Cosby is likely to get a concurrent sentence because the charges all stem from the same crime.

But Fairlie also points out that possible victim testimony at the sentencing hearing and Cosby’s outburst following the guilty verdict — Cosby shouted vulgarities at Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele — could lead the judge to consider a harsher sentence of up to 10 years.

“Hurling insults at the district attorney is not going to help his case,” he says.

The length of Cosby's sentence will determine where he serves time.

Zeiger says that if Cosby's sentence is less than one or two years, he'll likely serve it at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Eagleville, Pa., or through house arrest. He discounts the possibility of work release, citing Cosby's age.

""If it's one to two years or more, he would go into the state system in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"" he says, ""and then the trial court would lose jurisdiction over his custody.""

Donio says Cosby's lawyers will likely argue a prison will be unable to take care of Cosby, who has said he is completely blind. If they can successfully argue this position, and a jail assessment agrees, Cosby could get house arrest or probation.

The defense team is vowing to appeal his conviction.

As he left the courthouse Thursday, lead defense attorney Tom Mesereau vowed, ""The fight is not over,"" indicating his intent to appeal. However, an appeal cannot proceed until Cosby is sentenced.

""After the day of sentencing, you have 10 days to file a motion for reconsideration for certain things, like there wasn't enough evidence to convict or something is wrong with the sentencing,"" Zeiger explains. ""The 10-day motion stops the clock on everything. ... It's there intentionally for certain things that allow a trial court to correct simple mistakes.""

Next, he says, the judge would have the power to correct the mistake pointed out in the 10-day motion and remedy it. ""It could be a new trial; it could be new sentencing. If the 10-day motion is denied, the case moves to a higher court and the judge then just has to write an opinion explaining why he ruled a certain way and then the superior court has jurisdiction at that point.""

He adds that if the issues the defense plans to raise on appeal don't fit the parameters of a 10-day motion, they can immediately file a notice of appeal within 30 days of sentencing. ""But if you don't put (the tiny mistakes) in the 10-day motion, you can't appeal them at a later date.""

The civil cases against him will proceed.

""What's next?"" attorney Lisa Bloom tweeted after the guilty verdict came in. ""My defamation case on behalf of Janice Dickinson against Bill Cosby, which we've been fighting and winning for three-plus years, goes on.""

She added, ""Mr. Cosby, I'm looking forward to taking your deposition.""

Dickinson's California suit asserts that Cosby and lawyer Martin Singer defamed her by calling her a ""liar"" after she publicly accused Cosby of raping her in 2014, following several other women who had already stepped forward to say they had been assaulted by the entertainer. Cosby is appealing a ruling allowing Dickinson's case to proceed.

Three other civil cases wait in the wings, each having been put on hold until Cosby's criminal case is resolved.

All of those other allegations were too old to pursue in criminal court under statutes of limitation. Consequently, some of Cosby's accusers have filed lawsuits in civil courts seeking to go after Cosby. Here's an update on the other cases:

Judy Huth

In Los Angeles, Cosby is being sued by Judy Huth, who is repped by Bloom's mother, power lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents a number of other Cosby accusers, including three who were allowed to testify at the retrial.

In her suit, Huth accuses the comedian of sexual battery: She says he forced her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion around 1974, when she was 15. In June 2017, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan tentatively scheduled a trial on Huth's lawsuit for July 30, 2018.

In December, Cosby gave a deposition in the case, which was then sealed by a judge who ruled Cosby can be deposed again once the criminal case is concluded.

Chloe Goins

Former model Chloe Goins is suing the comedian for sexual battery and other claims, also in California. Goins says Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.

Prosecutors declined to file a criminal case against Cosby stemming from Goins' allegations, saying investigators could not corroborate them. Last summer, a judge denied Cosby's motion to dismiss and scheduled a trial for June 2018. Florida lawyer Spencer Kuvin represents Goins.

The Massachusetts defamation case

Seven women sued Cosby for defamation in one lawsuit pending in Massachusetts, where Cosby has a home in Shelburne Falls. They say he sexually abused them decades ago and then defamed them after they went public by having his agents deny the claims and brand them liars.

Repped by lawyer Joseph Cammarata, the suit started with one accuser, Tamara Green, and grew to include six other women: Therese Serignese, Linda Traitz, Louisa Moritz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and Angela Leslie.

But Judge Mark Mastroianni granted Cosby's motion to dismiss five of the counts relating to accuser Angela Leslie because the plaintiffs conceded the allegedly defamatory statements at issue were not about her. Cosby tweeted about the development on June 30, calling it another example of his success in getting claims against him dismissed.

New allegations are coming out at a furious pace , in part because of the newfound willingness of news organizations to pursue and publish allegations from women who now feel emboldened to tell their stories , many of them on the record.Media outlets are devoting tremendous resources to investigating their colleagues and competitors . Lists are circulating in journalism circles of men suspected of misconduct . The flood of allegations about top editors , reporters and executives is expected to continue.The cascade of claims of misconduct has opened the media to charges of hypocrisy as it covers allegations of sexual harassment and assault from Hollywood to Capitol Hill. “ The news media is supposed to be a surrogate for the public , and most Americans do n't like the thought that our surrogates are living in and endorsing workplace environments in which sexual harassment now seems to be too common , ” said Jeffrey McCall , a professor of media studies at DePauw University. “ Further complicating the media 's image in all of this is the sanctimonious manner in which the media has covered sexual harassment in other corners of society , ” McCall said . “ It is difficult for the news media to parade around as haughty overseers of right and wrong in broader contexts of society when they clearly have in-house confusion about first principles of decency. ” Bombshell stories from The New York Times and The New Yorker on producer Harvey Weinstein ’ s decades of alleged sexual assault and harassment of the women who worked for him set off a spate of investigations into men in political media who have long been rumored to have engaged in misconduct.Halperin , who co-wrote best-selling books on the 2008 and 2012 presidential races and covered the 2016 race on a popular reality show on Showtime , was the first major media figure to go down in the wake of the Weinstein allegations , although Fox News had made headlines before the Weinstein revelations with the ousters of chairman Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O ’ Reilly.On Monday , the stories about top media figures hit alarming new heights with allegations against well-known newsmen at The New York Times and CBS.Thrush , 50 , was suspended by the Times after a first-person account ran on Vox about his boorish behavior toward young women journalists who sought his professional counsel . Thrush rose to prominence for his aggressive reporting on the Trump administration , which earned him a contributing spot on MSNBC and a portrayal on “ Saturday Night Live. ” Rose , the anchor of CBS ’ s hit morning news program “ CBS This Morning ” and longtime host of an eponymous interview show broadcast on PBS , was fired from both gigs after The Washington Post detailed the accounts of eight women who have accused him of misconduct ranging from groping and improper touching to undressing in front of them.Thrush and Rose held leading roles in political print media and broadcast news respectively , giving Monday the feel of a watershed moment for an industry that has prided itself on exposing allegations of inappropriate behavior by President Trump and other prominent figures.CBS acknowledged in a statement that its reputation is on the line. “ CBS News has reported on extraordinary revelations at other media companies this last year , ” the network said . “ Our credibility in that reporting requires managing basic standards of behavior . That is why we have taken these actions. ” On `` CBS This Morning , ” fellow anchors Gayle King and Norah O ’ Donnell grappled with the fallout. “ Charlie does not get a pass here , ” King said . “ He doesn ’ t get a pass from anyone in this room . We are all deeply affected , we are all rocked by this . ”","A wave of sexual harassment allegations is ripping through the White House press corps and broadcast networks, forcing a reckoning on sexism and power dynamics inside newsrooms at a time when the media’s credibility is already under attack.

It’s only now they feel they have the social space or opportunity to speak out about it.” The allegations have sparked debate over the breadth of the problem and why the industry as a whole has been prone to abuse.Many female reporters said they’d become accustomed to poor treatment. But now, though, in the wake of cascading allegations across industries, they feel that their careers wouldn’t be damaged by speaking out about their experiences.Journalism is a competitive, male-dominated industry where the right contacts can make or break a career — a fact that could have helped drive and cover up the misconduct, said Steven Livingston, a media studies professor at George Washington University.“These institutions where upward mobility is a challenge and you have a lot of males in legacy positions of power, it sure looks like they’ve been using those factors to extract payment for passing through the gates,” Livingston said.“It’s shocking,” he continued. “The idea that it’s this widespread is mindboggling but totally affirming of what women have been saying for a long time. It’s only now they feel they have the social space or opportunity to speak out about it.”

New allegations are coming out at a furious pace, in part because of the newfound willingness of news organizations to pursue and publish allegations from women who now feel emboldened to tell their stories, many of them on the record.Media outlets are devoting tremendous resources to investigating their colleagues and competitors. Lists are circulating in journalism circles of men suspected of misconduct. The flood of allegations about top editors, reporters and executives is expected to continue.The cascade of claims of misconduct has opened the media to charges of hypocrisy as it covers allegations of sexual harassment and assault from Hollywood to Capitol Hill.“The news media is supposed to be a surrogate for the public, and most Americans don't like the thought that our surrogates are living in and endorsing workplace environments in which sexual harassment now seems to be too common,” said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of media studies at DePauw University.“Further complicating the media's image in all of this is the sanctimonious manner in which the media has covered sexual harassment in other corners of society,” McCall said. “It is difficult for the news media to parade around as haughty overseers of right and wrong in broader contexts of society when they clearly have in-house confusion about first principles of decency.”Bombshell stories from The New York Times and The New Yorker on producer Harvey Weinstein’s decades of alleged sexual assault and harassment of the women who worked for him set off a spate of investigations into men in political media who have long been rumored to have engaged in misconduct.Halperin, who co-wrote best-selling books on the 2008 and 2012 presidential races and covered the 2016 race on a popular reality show on Showtime, was the first major media figure to go down in the wake of the Weinstein allegations, although Fox News had made headlines before the Weinstein revelations with the ousters of chairman Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O’Reilly.On Monday, the stories about top media figures hit alarming new heights with allegations against well-known newsmen at The New York Times and CBS.Thrush, 50, was suspended by the Times after a first-person account ran on Vox about his boorish behavior toward young women journalists who sought his professional counsel. Thrush rose to prominence for his aggressive reporting on the Trump administration, which earned him a contributing spot on MSNBC and a portrayal on “Saturday Night Live.”Rose, the anchor of CBS’s hit morning news program “CBS This Morning” and longtime host of an eponymous interview show broadcast on PBS, was fired from both gigs after The Washington Post detailed the accounts of eight women who have accused him of misconduct ranging from groping and improper touching to undressing in front of them.Thrush and Rose held leading roles in political print media and broadcast news respectively, giving Monday the feel of a watershed moment for an industry that has prided itself on exposing allegations of inappropriate behavior by President Trump and other prominent figures.CBS acknowledged in a statement that its reputation is on the line.“CBS News has reported on extraordinary revelations at other media companies this last year,” the network said. “Our credibility in that reporting requires managing basic standards of behavior. That is why we have taken these actions.”On ""CBS This Morning,” fellow anchors Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell grappled with the fallout.“Charlie does not get a pass here,” King said. “He doesn’t get a pass from anyone in this room. We are all deeply affected, we are all rocked by this.”",www.thehill.com,center,lN1MJwBtKkRUDRTi
sexual_misconduct,PBS NewsHour,1,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-74-former-biden-staffers-think-about-tara-reades-allegations,What 74 former Biden staffers think about Tara Reade’s allegations,2020-05-15,"Daniel Bush, Lisa Desjardins","Over his decades-long career in the Senate , former Vice President Joe Biden was known as a demanding but fair and family-oriented boss , devoted to his home life in Delaware and committed to gender equality in his office .
He was not on a list of “ creepy ” male senators that female staffers told each other to avoid in the elevators on Capitol Hill .
Yet Biden , now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , was also a toucher , seemingly oblivious to whether physical contact made some women uncomfortable . That behavior has persisted in recent years . Biden is now facing fresh scrutiny after a former aide in March charged that he sexually assaulted her when she worked in his Senate office in the early 1990s , an allegation Biden has categorically denied .
The ███ spoke with 74 former Biden staffers , of whom 62 were women , in order to get a broader picture of his behavior toward women over the course of his career , how they see the new allegation , and whether there was evidence of a larger pattern .
None of the people interviewed said that they had experienced sexual harassment , assault or misconduct by Biden . All said they never heard any rumors or allegations of Biden engaging in sexual misconduct , until the recent assault allegation made by Tara Reade . Former staffers said they believed Reade should be heard , and acknowledged that their experiences do not disprove her accusation .
In all , the NewsHour tried to contact nearly 200 former staffers of Biden ’ s , based primarily on public records of his time in the Senate and White House and also from interviews with current campaign advisers . They include former interns and senior aides , from his 1972 Senate campaign through his time at the White House .
Some are still in politics , others left long ago to pursue other careers . They were asked about Reade ’ s allegation but also whether they , or anyone they know , were ever uncomfortable around Biden . Many said that her sexual assault allegation was at odds with their knowledge of Biden ’ s behavior toward women .
The interviews revealed previously unreported details about the Biden office when Reade worked there , such as an account that she lost her job because of her poor performance , not as retaliation for lodging complaints about sexual harassment , as Reade has said .
Other recollections from former staffers corroborated things she has described publicly , such as Biden ’ s use of the Senate gym and a supervisor admonishing her for dressing inappropriately .
Overall , the people who spoke to the NewsHour described largely positive and gratifying experiences working for Biden , painting a portrait of someone who was ahead of his time in empowering women in the workplace .
“ The one thing about Joe Biden is , he is a man of the highest character and that ’ s why these accusations are so surreal and just can ’ t comport with the man I worked with , ” said Marcia Lee Taylor , a senior policy advisor on the Judiciary Committee , where women held leading roles when Biden served as chairman .
But he had blindspots , which Biden himself has publicly acknowledged , when it came to how his interactions with women in public could make them uncomfortable .
Reade declined the NewsHour ’ s interview request but her attorney , Doug Wigdor , sent detailed answers to a number of questions by email . He wrote that Biden ’ s public touching is evidence that he could have mistreated his client in the way she claims .
“ I don ’ t think anyone would describe these situations as normal , ” Wigdor wrote . “ They are troublesome , to say the least . ”
Many former Biden staffers said they believe Reade ’ s allegation is false .
Since Reade went public with her assault accusation in March , former staffers of Biden ’ s world have been scanning their memories , considering the details of her story and their own experiences .
Reade , in interviews with multiple news outlets , has alleged that Biden attacked her in the Senate complex when she met him on an errand . But her accusations are also more sweeping . She has charged that the Biden office was a toxic place to work , that the senator touched her shoulders and neck multiple times , and that she was asked to serve drinks because he thought she was pretty . Reade has also claimed she was demoted and ultimately pushed to leave because she complained about workplace harassment .
The NewsHour spoke with more than 20 people who worked for Biden when Reade was also a staffer . Some remembered her , many did not .
Ben Savage , who said his desk was next to Reade ’ s in the Biden mailroom , disputed her charge that she was forced out of her job in retaliation for a sexual harassment complaint she claims to have filed .
Savage , who worked as the office ’ s systems administrator , overseeing computers and information processing , told the NewsHour that Reade was fired for her poor performance on the job , which he witnessed — not as retaliation for her complaints about sexual harassment .
But according to Savage , Reade had been mishandling a key part of her job and an essential office task — processing constituent mail , something they worked on together . Savage said he recalls reporting these issues to his boss , deputy chief of staff Dennis Toner . After that , Savage said he began diminishing Reade ’ s duties , taking over some of her tasks and rerouting parts of the process to exclude her .
“ I don ’ t think anyone would describe these situations as normal . They are troublesome , to say the least . ”
“ Of all the people who held that position , she ’ s the only one during my time there who couldn ’ t necessarily keep up or who found it frustrating , ” said Savage , who worked in the office for three years , from 1993 to 1996 .
Toner , who was Savage ’ s direct supervisor , told the NewsHour that he did not remember Reade . He said he did remember Savage as a good worker who stood out in the office .
“ I can ’ t take issue with Ben saying that her job performance was not up to par . We would have had a discussion with Tara or whomever the employee would have been to see how we could make it work , ” Toner said . “ I do not recall Tara being in the office . I can ’ t comment on why she would have left or anything like that , ” he added .
Wigdor , Reade ’ s attorney , said that she does not remember Savage specifically , but said his story is wrong and her performance had nothing to do with her termination .
“ Ms . Reade recalls that there was a lot of nitpicking regarding her performance in the office , ” he wrote . “ She was also very nervous at that point and distracted so it is possible that from time to time there was a mistake made … but her performance had nothing to do with her termination . ”
More broadly , Wigdor said , it was “ not surprising ” that former staffers would say they did not believe the allegation against Biden . Wigdor argued that former aides have an incentive to stand with Biden because they could benefit personally if he becomes president , do not want to have “ their lives turned upside down if they come out against him , ” or are simply motivated by a desire to protect Biden to help bolster his chances of beating President Donald Trump in the general election .
Reade ’ s story has been corroborated publicly by three people who spoke with other news organizations , saying she told them in the past about the alleged assault . Despite numerous attempts to contact them via phone , email and through a lawyer , none of them responded or could be reached for comment on this story .
Biden ’ s presidential campaign responded with a statement from deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield .
“ Whether it was in his campaigns , his Senate office , his family , or in the Obama Administration , Joe Biden has always championed and empowered women professionals . He has and will always insist on a workplace culture built on respect , equality and dignity , leading by his own example , ” Bedingfield said .
Last year , after seven women — including Reade — publicly stated Biden made unwanted physical contact with them , like touching their shoulders and smelling their hair , he released a video and tweet addressing their concerns .
“ Social norms are changing , ” he wrote . “ I ’ ve heard what these women are saying . Politics to me has always been about making connections , but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future . ”
Reade did not publicly accuse Biden of sexual assault until March of this year .
Reade has claimed a supervisor admonished her for the way she dressed and asked her to be more modest . She has claimed this was a baseless criticism and retaliation for her complaint about sexual harassment from Biden .
A woman who worked with Reade , but who spoke to the NewsHour on the condition she not be named , said she remembers Reade mentioning that she was scolded for her attire and that Reade asked her if it was a legitimate complaint . That coworker and two other staffers who worked with Reade said they believe she was not appropriately dressed for work .
Reade has said that she was bringing Biden his gym bag , somewhere “ down toward the Capitol , ” when the alleged assault took place .
Several staffers confirmed to the NewsHour that Biden regularly used the Senate gym , and that a person in Reade ’ s position might have been asked to bring him items , such as paperwork , or in one example given , Advil , that he needed . None of them recalled ever bringing him a gym bag .
Biden ’ s Senate offices were in a prime location , bookending the second floor of the Russell Senate Office building , the closest to the U.S. Capitol .
Reade ’ s attorney told the NewsHour that Reade recalls the assault happening “ in a semiprivate area like an alcove ” and that it was “ somewhere between the Russell ( building ) and/or Capitol building. ” He pointed out that survivors often have difficulty with specifics about trauma .
Reade ’ s description aligns with other staffers ’ recollections of Biden ’ s short indoor route between his office and the Capitol . It is a roughly 10-minute walk that consists of one flight of stairs and one long hallway inside the Russell Building , followed by a wide tunnel through which he could walk or take an internal subway train to the Capitol .
The layout of that route and building has not changed . A recent walk through that area showed the subway tunnel contains no out-of-view areas , like an alcove . The remaining portion of the route includes multiple stairwells as well as corridors lined with offices . It is a main thoroughfare for senators and staffers .
Some former staffers told the NewsHour that if Biden did assault Reade in any of these places , it would have been a brazen attack in an area with a high risk of being seen .
“ He didn ’ t want an image of a young woman staffer serving him . ”
“ When I worked in the Senate , it was always crowded [ and ] packed with lobbyists , staff and tourists , ” said Sheila Nix , who was Biden ’ s chief of staff on the 2012 presidential campaign and previously worked as chief of staff to two other Democratic senators .
In interviews , staffers have also raised doubts about Reade ’ s claim that she was asked to serve drinks at a fundraiser , an incident she said she included in an official complaint of sexual harassment submitted while she worked in the office .
But more than 50 former staffers said they didn ’ t remember ever attending a fundraiser for Biden in Washington , D.C. , when they were on his Senate staff . And some recalled an office policy banning most of Biden ’ s Senate staff from doing campaign work .
“ Never would have happened , ” said Melissa Lefko , who was a staff assistant in Biden ’ s office during the time Reade was there . “ We all knew there was a very hard line there . ”
Dozens of staffers , from different eras , said Biden rarely attended any events in Washington , racing to catch his train home to Wilmington , Delaware , as soon as Senate voting ended each night .
Further , two men who worked as junior staffers for Biden said the senator specifically did not want women to serve beverages , like coffee , or perform other menial tasks in his Senate office or on the committees he chaired . Men were typically asked to perform such tasks .
“ He didn ’ t want an image of a young woman staffer serving him , ” said John Earnhardt , who took over Reade ’ s duties . Reade left the office in mid-1993 , after working there approximately nine months .
In separate and in-depth interviews , women who worked for Biden generally did not want to weigh in with certainty on whether they believed Reade ’ s allegation was true . But they all said it is at odds with their experience .
Numerous former Biden staffers said they felt he treated men and women equally , and that he was known for hiring women for top jobs that women seldom held in other Senate offices .
“ Biden has a terrific record on hiring women at very high levels and doing it long before other people did , ” said Diana Huffman , who served as the staff director for the Judiciary Committee in the late 1980s , when Biden was chair .
“ He was fully embracing the idea that women should have the same opportunities and be taken with the same seriousness as male staff . That was distinctive , ” said Liz Sherwood-Randall , a former senior foreign policy adviser to Biden .
The experiences of former Biden staffers underscore the complicated nature of sexual assault reporting and how to judge conflicting portraits of an individual . It is a current topic of research and heated debate among experts .
“ It only takes one act to be worthy of consideration , ” said Juliet Williams , a gender studies expert at the University of California , Los Angeles , pointing out that years of inoffensive behavior with many or even most women does not indicate whether someone is capable of ever committing an offense .
“ When we try someone for murder it ’ s not like , ‘ Well there ’ s serial murders and one-offers , ’ ” Williams said . “ There ’ s certain kinds of behavior that are never acceptable . Quantity is not the only metric . ”
Sherry Hamby , the founding editor of the academic journal The Psychology of Violence , also said that any pattern is possible .
She described the idea of a 50-year-old man , the age Biden was at the time of the alleged attack , committing his first and only act of sexual assault as improbable . “ In terms of likely statistical pattern , that would be an incredibly unlikely trajectory to see , ” Hamby said .
But she and others also noted that false reports of sexual assault are rare , and that the way women ’ s accusations are evaluated is flawed because they face more pressure than men to have their stories corroborated or to prove that they ’ re part of a larger group of victims .
Still , Williams said , “ I do think it is worth recording if the evidence shows that in the case of the former vice president there are scores of women who actually praise him for his collegiality and professionalism and respect . ”
Biden ’ s office was known for having women-friendly work policies . For example , he promoted at least one Senate staffer while she was on maternity leave . As vice president , he helped secure paid family leave for White House employees .
Female staffers who spent countless hours with Biden , including in one-on-one settings , like his small private office in the U.S. Capitol , known as a “ hideaway , ” said he never made passes at them or behaved in other ways that suggested sexual impropriety .
Victoria Nourse , who served as Biden ’ s top lawyer on the Judiciary Committee in the early 1990s , recalled Biden ’ s reaction when another official made a comment about her looks in front of Biden during a flight in 1991 . The man said , “ ‘ Oh Joe , let me sit next to the pretty girl , ’ ” recalled Nourse , who later served as Biden ’ s chief counsel in the White House .
Biden told the man off , Nourse said , “ making it clear that we were here for work , and that was inappropriate — in a very no nonsense way . ”
“ I traveled with him all over the world , all over the country . I was alone with him all the time , ” said Elizabeth Alexander , a former Senate and White House aide . “ Never , ever , ever did I feel uncomfortable . ”
The Reade accusation is part of a larger , decades-long discussion about misogyny on Capitol Hill . It highlights a pivot point in the Senate in the 1990s , when a then-record four women were newly elected to the chamber , and prominent claims of sexual harassment drew more attention to the behavior of male senators .
Biden was a central figure and front-row witness to this shift .
In October 1991 , Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee when Anita Hill testified that Clarence Thomas , then a Supreme Court nominee , had sexually harassed her in the workplace . Biden has been roundly criticized by advocates for women and former Democratic senators for agreeing to keep other female witnesses from testifying about Thomas ’ conduct toward them , and for appearing tone-deaf on sexual harassment .
Five months later , in March 1992 , Sen. Brock Adams , D-Wash. , announced his retirement after the Seattle Times reported that eight women had accused him of sexual crimes , including drugging and molesting them .
At the time , a climate of harassment and sexual entitlement existed in some offices in the Senate , driven by some male senators whose behavior was well known on Capitol Hill .
“ We all worked in a culture where men put their hands on you , often , ” said Mary Byrne , who worked in the Senate from 1988 to 1995 . “ I remember sitting at a desk outside the Agriculture Committee and one staffer would come in and give you a shoulder massage , say you are doing good , ” Byrne said . “ Men there felt they had access to your body as a young woman . ”
Byrne also said she remembers walking in on a female deputy chief of staff sitting on a senator ’ s lap . Another person who worked in the Senate at the time told the NewsHour he recalled seeing a senator with his arm around the waist of a young female staffer on an elevator .
Byrne , like many women working on the Hill in those years , talked with other female aides about a “ list ” of senators to avoid .
“ You got to know which senators you didn ’ t want to be on an elevator alone with , ” said Liz Tankersley , who was Biden ’ s legislative director from 1985 to 1993 . “ No one ever said Joe Biden was one of them . ”
On that list in 1993 , according to multiple staffers , was Sen. Bob Packwood , R-Ore . He later resigned , in 1995 , after the public revelation that he had engaged in years of aggressive sexual behavior toward women , including staffers . The late Sen. Strom Thurmond , R-S.C. , was also infamously on the avoid-elevator list , staffers claimed . So was another now-deceased lawmaker — Sen. Ted Kennedy , D-Mass .
“ I know some of those people on the list , ” said former Sen. Dennis DeConcini , a Democrat from Arizona who served from 1977 to 1995 and sat on the Judiciary Committee with Biden for many years . “ There were several , it was almost common knowledge . And Biden was never mentioned in any of that . He went home every night to Delaware . ”
Around the time Reade alleges Biden attacked her , he was building a reputation as a leading crusader on behalf of women . Biden had already introduced and was pushing for passage of the landmark Violence Against Women Act . In March 1993 , he held a hearing on protecting women from stalkers .
“ You got to know which senators you didn ’ t want to be on an elevator alone with . No one ever said Joe Biden was one of them . ”
But Byrne , who was then press secretary to Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham , and others told the NewsHour that Biden was known for his habit of touching people when interacting with them .
“ We knew that about Biden , ” Byrne said . “ He was always massaging somebody ’ s shoulders . But never anything more than that . There was no vibe about him . ”
Many staffers stressed that people frequently gravitate to Biden , as a kind of “ comforter-in-chief , ” and look for an arm around a shoulder or a kiss on the cheek .
However , staffers agree it was not in Biden ’ s nature to gauge social signals about whether someone wanted to be hugged or touched . Many said they learned that he might do so without warning , though most saw it as an endearing quality that wasn ’ t sexual in nature .
A former staffer said that when Biden does things like stroking women ’ s hair , there ’ s a complicated dynamic at play .
His behavior toward women can be “ somewhat infantilizing , ” the staffer said . “ That doesn ’ t look like equality , right ? But that was an expression of empathy , as opposed to flirtation . ”
For others , Biden ’ s touching evoked some regret . “ There were times as I now look back that I think we messed up . We should have said something about that , ” a different former staffer said . “ We probably should have recognized that made people uncomfortable . ”
Rachel Wellford and Saher Khan contributed reporting to this story .","Over his decades-long career in the Senate, former Vice President Joe Biden was known as a demanding but fair and family-oriented boss, devoted to his home life in Delaware and committed to gender equality in his office.

Addressing Tara Reade’s allegations

Since Reade went public with her assault accusation in March, former staffers of Biden’s world have been scanning their memories, considering the details of her story and their own experiences.

Savage, who worked as the office’s systems administrator, overseeing computers and information processing, told the NewsHour that Reade was fired for her poor performance on the job, which he witnessed — not as retaliation for her complaints about sexual harassment.

But according to Savage, Reade had been mishandling a key part of her job and an essential office task — processing constituent mail, something they worked on together. Savage said he recalls reporting these issues to his boss, deputy chief of staff Dennis Toner. After that, Savage said he began diminishing Reade’s duties, taking over some of her tasks and rerouting parts of the process to exclude her.

“I don’t think anyone would describe these situations as normal. They are troublesome, to say the least.”

“Of all the people who held that position, she’s the only one during my time there who couldn’t necessarily keep up or who found it frustrating,” said Savage, who worked in the office for three years, from 1993 to 1996.

But more than 50 former staffers said they didn’t remember ever attending a fundraiser for Biden in Washington, D.C., when they were on his Senate staff. And some recalled an office policy banning most of Biden’s Senate staff from doing campaign work.

“Never would have happened,” said Melissa Lefko, who was a staff assistant in Biden’s office during the time Reade was there. “We all knew there was a very hard line there.”

Dozens of staffers, from different eras, said Biden rarely attended any events in Washington, racing to catch his train home to Wilmington, Delaware, as soon as Senate voting ended each night.

Further, two men who worked as junior staffers for Biden said the senator specifically did not want women to serve beverages, like coffee, or perform other menial tasks in his Senate office or on the committees he chaired. Men were typically asked to perform such tasks.

“He didn’t want an image of a young woman staffer serving him,” said John Earnhardt, who took over Reade’s duties. Reade left the office in mid-1993, after working there approximately nine months.

Biden’s treatment of women

In separate and in-depth interviews, women who worked for Biden generally did not want to weigh in with certainty on whether they believed Reade’s allegation was true. But they all said it is at odds with their experience.

Numerous former Biden staffers said they felt he treated men and women equally, and that he was known for hiring women for top jobs that women seldom held in other Senate offices.

“Biden has a terrific record on hiring women at very high levels and doing it long before other people did,” said Diana Huffman, who served as the staff director for the Judiciary Committee in the late 1980s, when Biden was chair.

“He was fully embracing the idea that women should have the same opportunities and be taken with the same seriousness as male staff. That was distinctive,” said Liz Sherwood-Randall, a former senior foreign policy adviser to Biden.

The experiences of former Biden staffers underscore the complicated nature of sexual assault reporting and how to judge conflicting portraits of an individual. It is a current topic of research and heated debate among experts.

“It only takes one act to be worthy of consideration,” said Juliet Williams, a gender studies expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, pointing out that years of inoffensive behavior with many or even most women does not indicate whether someone is capable of ever committing an offense.

“When we try someone for murder it’s not like, ‘Well there’s serial murders and one-offers,’” Williams said. “There’s certain kinds of behavior that are never acceptable. Quantity is not the only metric.”

Sherry Hamby, the founding editor of the academic journal The Psychology of Violence, also said that any pattern is possible.

She described the idea of a 50-year-old man, the age Biden was at the time of the alleged attack, committing his first and only act of sexual assault as improbable. “In terms of likely statistical pattern, that would be an incredibly unlikely trajectory to see,” Hamby said.

But she and others also noted that false reports of sexual assault are rare, and that the way women’s accusations are evaluated is flawed because they face more pressure than men to have their stories corroborated or to prove that they’re part of a larger group of victims.

Still, Williams said, “I do think it is worth recording if the evidence shows that in the case of the former vice president there are scores of women who actually praise him for his collegiality and professionalism and respect.”

Biden’s office was known for having women-friendly work policies. For example, he promoted at least one Senate staffer while she was on maternity leave. As vice president, he helped secure paid family leave for White House employees.

Female staffers who spent countless hours with Biden, including in one-on-one settings, like his small private office in the U.S. Capitol, known as a “hideaway,” said he never made passes at them or behaved in other ways that suggested sexual impropriety.

“Never, ever, ever did I feel uncomfortable.”

Victoria Nourse, who served as Biden’s top lawyer on the Judiciary Committee in the early 1990s, recalled Biden’s reaction when another official made a comment about her looks in front of Biden during a flight in 1991. The man said, “‘Oh Joe, let me sit next to the pretty girl,’” recalled Nourse, who later served as Biden’s chief counsel in the White House.

Biden told the man off, Nourse said, “making it clear that we were here for work, and that was inappropriate — in a very no nonsense way.”

“I traveled with him all over the world, all over the country. I was alone with him all the time,” said Elizabeth Alexander, a former Senate and White House aide. “Never, ever, ever did I feel uncomfortable.”

Hill culture

The Reade accusation is part of a larger, decades-long discussion about misogyny on Capitol Hill. It highlights a pivot point in the Senate in the 1990s, when a then-record four women were newly elected to the chamber, and prominent claims of sexual harassment drew more attention to the behavior of male senators.

Biden was a central figure and front-row witness to this shift.

In October 1991, Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee when Anita Hill testified that Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee, had sexually harassed her in the workplace. Biden has been roundly criticized by advocates for women and former Democratic senators for agreeing to keep other female witnesses from testifying about Thomas’ conduct toward them, and for appearing tone-deaf on sexual harassment.

Five months later, in March 1992, Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., announced his retirement after the Seattle Times reported that eight women had accused him of sexual crimes, including drugging and molesting them.

At the time, a climate of harassment and sexual entitlement existed in some offices in the Senate, driven by some male senators whose behavior was well known on Capitol Hill.

“We all worked in a culture where men put their hands on you, often,” said Mary Byrne, who worked in the Senate from 1988 to 1995. “I remember sitting at a desk outside the Agriculture Committee and one staffer would come in and give you a shoulder massage, say you are doing good,” Byrne said. “Men there felt they had access to your body as a young woman.”

Byrne also said she remembers walking in on a female deputy chief of staff sitting on a senator’s lap. Another person who worked in the Senate at the time told the NewsHour he recalled seeing a senator with his arm around the waist of a young female staffer on an elevator.

Byrne, like many women working on the Hill in those years, talked with other female aides about a “list” of senators to avoid.

“You got to know which senators you didn’t want to be on an elevator alone with,” said Liz Tankersley, who was Biden’s legislative director from 1985 to 1993. “No one ever said Joe Biden was one of them.”

On that list in 1993, according to multiple staffers, was Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore. He later resigned, in 1995, after the public revelation that he had engaged in years of aggressive sexual behavior toward women, including staffers. The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., was also infamously on the avoid-elevator list, staffers claimed. So was another now-deceased lawmaker — Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.

“I know some of those people on the list,” said former Sen. Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat from Arizona who served from 1977 to 1995 and sat on the Judiciary Committee with Biden for many years. “There were several, it was almost common knowledge. And Biden was never mentioned in any of that. He went home every night to Delaware.”

Around the time Reade alleges Biden attacked her, he was building a reputation as a leading crusader on behalf of women. Biden had already introduced and was pushing for passage of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. In March 1993, he held a hearing on protecting women from stalkers.

“You got to know which senators you didn’t want to be on an elevator alone with. No one ever said Joe Biden was one of them.”

But Byrne, who was then press secretary to Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham, and others told the NewsHour that Biden was known for his habit of touching people when interacting with them.

“We knew that about Biden,” Byrne said. “He was always massaging somebody’s shoulders. But never anything more than that. There was no vibe about him.”

Many staffers stressed that people frequently gravitate to Biden, as a kind of “comforter-in-chief,” and look for an arm around a shoulder or a kiss on the cheek.

However, staffers agree it was not in Biden’s nature to gauge social signals about whether someone wanted to be hugged or touched. Many said they learned that he might do so without warning, though most saw it as an endearing quality that wasn’t sexual in nature.

A former staffer said that when Biden does things like stroking women’s hair, there’s a complicated dynamic at play.

His behavior toward women can be “somewhat infantilizing,” the staffer said. “That doesn’t look like equality, right? But that was an expression of empathy, as opposed to flirtation.”

For others, Biden’s touching evoked some regret. “There were times as I now look back that I think we messed up. We should have said something about that,” a different former staffer said. “We probably should have recognized that made people uncomfortable.”

Women are free to opt out of hookup culture if they don’t like what it offers them.

Call it the Aziz Ansari problem. A guy behaved boorishly on a date. This behavior fell well short of a crime. What now?

To some extent, the two sides in the Ansari debate are talking past each other. The celebrated comedian, actor, and self-identified male feminist behaved like an utter lout on his now-famous date with “Grace.” The pseudonymous young woman in question (just 23) understandably felt ill-used by the encounter, and following the guidelines that have been established on campus, she channeled her bad feelings into the language of crime. “It took a really long time for me to validate this as sexual assault,” “Grace” said in the gruesomely detailed 3,000-word piece that, it seems safe to guess, has now been read by millions. “It really hit me that I was violated,” she also says, implying that not merely assault but actual rape took place.

Oh? Then why didn’t she go to the police instead of to Babe.net? Because even Grace actually understands that no crime occurred. Sex willingly embarked upon by both parties, even if one party feels reluctance or disgust or shame, is not a crime.

Yet Grace just knows a wrong has been done, and wrongs must be punished. She and Babe.net have chosen the punishment of destroying Ansari’s reputation, just as women on campus have been seeking to undo young men like Ansari by having them thrown off campus. Such a punishment might follow a man around for life and do substantial harm to his reputation and job prospects. So be it, say their accusers.

Olson, Ray Andrews, Jim Gorman, Hamish Alcorn, Barney Doran, Lightning Rose, Wallace Simpson","In the summer of 1991 , I was a very innocent 15 year-old with the remnants of childish plumpness on my face and the suggestion of womanly plumpness on my figure . I had just completed grade 10 at a private Christian school and was starting my first job as a hostess and cashier at a local 24-hour restaurant . Over the next few weeks I was subjected to relentless sexual harassment : comments on my figure , sexist jokes and innuendo , and outright sexual propositions . The kitchen was staffed by coarse young men , all around their mid-twenties , who were clearly gratified by teasing a sweet young girl with their vulgar running commentary .
In the wake of the # MeToo movement , women ’ s stories such as this one have become a familiar narrative . With one important difference : after recovering from my initial sense of awkwardness and embarrassment , I found the sexual banter empowering , exciting , and even—gasp ! —funny . I started to realize that if the line cooks threw a sexual joke or comment to me , I was invited to throw one back to them . I soon realized that , although one of them would proposition me a number of times during an eight hour shift , I had the power to reject him—not just reject him but to do so with a playful insult that then made him the butt of jokes along the short order line for the rest of the shift .
What I learned that summer was that the adult world was often about sex . I learned that I didn ’ t need to be afraid of it . I learned that I had a lot more power over men than I originally thought—not simply because , as a cute young thing , I was awakening to my own feminine sexuality and realized how keenly the guys wanted me to like them , but because I had more power than I realized to reject their advances , to assert my sense of sexual agency not because it was a private and protected part of me , but precisely because it was so openly commented upon .
What I realized , too , is that these exchanges weren ’ t offensive , they were playful ; that they weren ’ t demeaning , but led to mutual respect . It was the very indecency of the back of house culture that made working at that 24-hour restaurant a tolerable job , and it was all the vulgar insults of the workplace that gave a kind of gritty dignity to our work there . Working there one became part of family . Flouting the rules that govern social niceties , which had to be observed carefully in the restaurant dining room , was the initiation into the clan . What I ’ ve learned since that summer is that the culture of that greasy spoon kitchen has a rich anthropology ; it ’ s the type of community that populates the taverns of Shakespeare ’ s plays , for instance , and it functions in direct opposition to officialdom . Its currency is an abundance of filthy light-heartedness , and its economy subverts the normative claims of merit and respectability , those two pillars of social authority and middle-class morality . In the kitchen , the more horrible you are , the better ! The profane and free culture of the kitchen was the antidote to the polite restraint of the dining room , as it is to ethic of rigid inoffensiveness that governs our politically correct culture .
What I experienced that summer are two related but distinct aspects of feminine sexual empowerment . The first was an awareness that it is the dirty jokes and sexual jibes of anti-official cultures that allow its members to feel a closeness to each other ; it is a kind of solidarity achieved through a laughing disregard for formal decency . The sexual language of the back of house erased the social divisions that would normally demand our politeness . ( Some of the line cooks were high-school dropouts ; a few had criminal records . I was the daughter of civil engineer , attending private school , and on a fairly streamlined track to academic studies . And yet here I was , being teased by these guys , and in turn jabbing back at them , tit for tat . ) What would now be considered clear-cut sexual harassment was the very thing that forged a true respect amongst us : the guys in the kitchen believed I was tough enough to take their insults . It was in their very coarseness that they treated me with honesty and equality . Treating me as a fragile young woman too delicate to handle their dirty comments , now that would be have been insulting !
The other component of female strength that I discovered that summer was the power inherent in my sexual self-restraint , or what historically has been known as “ feminine virtue. ” I ’ m certainly not advocating for any notion of sexual purity or for some cult of female chastity . Rather , what I ’ m suggesting is that there is a uniquely feminine power to say either yes or , as was the case with me , no . I felt connected to women ’ s history in a way we don ’ t hear about often today : I am empowered as a woman because I am a woman . I began to understand that feminine virtue instructs men in masculine virtue . At times , I returned a sexual comment not with another insult , but with an eyeroll , and sometimes I ’ d assert myself not by outdoing a dirty remark , but by activating codes of gallantry and manliness . A blush and a quiet “ Alright . That ’ s enough , ” would change the tone of the kitchen banter entirely . In contrast to the dining room where a polite separation existed between staff and customers , in the kitchen intimacy was displayed not just through insults but also through gentleness , and through gentlemanliness—and all it took was a blush ! Resting on my feminine “ weaker ” nature was the way to control the social dynamic of the “ toxic masculinity ” of the back of house culture .
Before I go any further , I should make one thing clear : at 15 I was virginal and innocent , but I was in no way naïve—the constant crackling of the sexual tension in the kitchen of that 24-hour restaurant was instructive to me in other important ways : though I was beginning to develop a clear sense of my feminine power , I realized I was not invulnerable to predatory masculine sexuality . A large part of my tutelage that summer was in street smarts . Occasionally a table of men would come in who were real pigs . Not part of the working tribe , they had no claim to insult me with impunity . Their comments were often disgusting , and it was a humiliating experience—for them ! I had by then learned the power of female scorn , and it worked pretty effectively to shut down lewd comments . Most of the time . Rarely , but occasionally , at the end of a shift , one of these men would still be lounging in a booth , drinking coffee and smoking without much else going on . I don ’ t know if any one of these guys ever posed an actual threat to me or to my female co-workers . We never took the chance to find out . If a shift ended late and it was dark out and one of the girls ’ car was parked at the far end of the lot , she would ask one of the cooks or male servers to walk her out . And they always behaved like gentlemen when they did so—though they very likely were “ harassing ” us during the shift . This wasn ’ t seen by any of us as unfair or a double standard or in any way remarkable . It was just good common sense . As far as I know , even though that restaurant was open 24 hours and every night there would always be a rowdy post-midnight rush after the local bars shut their doors , not once was a female staff assaulted at work or while leaving it .
Yes , I have other female friends who weren ’ t so fortunate , and it ought to go without saying that the men who assaulted them should be subjected to the fullest rigour of the law . There is a tremendous difference , however , between coarse co-workers and dangerous misogynists ; a difference between colleagues who tell a dirty joke and those who use coercion to elicit sex . Losing the ability to appreciate nuance is not a triumph of moral progress . It is stupidity masquerading as enlightenment . If we elide the two , then it is true that women will no longer feel the confusion and embarrassment I felt during my first couple of shifts . But we will also eliminate the opportunity for women to embody a position of strength and maturity that is only possible when confronted with sexual advances . There was nothing special about me as a 15 year-old girl . My sense of myself as a strong , free woman developed as a direct result of being subjected to the propositions of my coworkers . I said no . A lot . Saying no did not cause the jokes and the indecency to stop . Far from it . That part of restaurant culture remained very much alive . It was in fact an essential part of the health of the restaurant—funny though that sounds today—because it was accompanied by joy and toughness , and because it helped me to understand the power of my feminine sexual virtue . It felt like a superpower .
Contemporary feminism insists that the ideals of feminine virtue were a trick played on women by the patriarchy in order to keep female sexuality under control . Yet what I learned that summer was the opposite : my feminine virtue , traditionally understood , allowed me to control men . Women throughout the centuries have not primarily understood themselves as victims of patriarchal oppression—all one has to do is look to Jane Austen ’ s plucky heroines , or Shakespeare ’ s witty bar-wenches , or Chaucer ’ s sexual dynamo the Wife of Bath . But since the 1980s , young women , and men , have increasingly been taught that this has been the case , and we retroactively reinterpret the narratives of the past in order to reconfirm our own sense of moral progress . This has resulted , however , not in women becoming stronger , but rather in a pervasive culture of victimhood . One can ’ t be virtuous by the old standards , since those were devised by men to keep women oppressed , and one can ’ t claim to embody feminine virtue in itself , because that would essentialize gender , and we now know that gender is socially constructed . The only avenue left is to claim righteous indignation at the mistreatment of women by men . This is the narrative of perpetual victimization . It is a story of despair—plus it isn ’ t much fun !
Of course , a reasonable objection to the kind of sexually saturated culture I ’ m describing here is that an individual should be treated as a professional in their job , not as any kind of representative of gender and certainly not as a sexual object . Professional androgyny is the ideal . Yet I can ’ t think of a more Orwellian nightmare than everyone becoming reduced to their job , to their function in the service of… what ? Corporate gain ? Bureaucratic convenience ? To their utility ? As though the highest aim of humanity is to be treated as the mere conduit of some professional task ?
Since my time at that restaurant , I have experienced professional sexual discrimination , and assault . I understand what it feels like . And I understand what a dirty joke feels like . If we have lost the ability to distinguish between the two , then there we are either a society of frankly stupid people who are calling a social triumph what is actually our inability to differentiate between coercive sexual threats and a kind of proletarian sexual rambunctiousness , or we are moving toward administrated and alienating human relations with a kind of gleeful despair . We are defining as justice what is really our transfer of sovereignty to impersonal and inhumane bureaucratic systems of authority .
If we maintain that a world without sexual commentary of any kind is better than a world in which one has to negotiate sexual advances—oh , the horror ! —for oneself , then we are denying our young girls the opportunity to become strong , tough , and independent women who are capable of handling adult sexuality . If a joke is too much for us , then feminism has lost and it is time to bring out the Victorian fainting couch . When we enforce codes of behaviour that punish any kind of sexual suggestion or innuendo , we encourage the encroachment of officialdom , the rules that govern the polite formalities of the dining room , into the spaces that have traditionally operated in opposition to rigid authority . Human closeness and real respect is lost . And in its place reigns the totalitarian regime of institutionalized inoffensiveness .
It may be that contemporary consciousness raising feminism does not respect women , for it sees them as incapable of nuance and of being able to handle sexual situations . The coarse short order cooks who harassed the young 15 year-old hostess weren ’ t feminists . But they acted on the very premise that feminists once claimed as their own : they treated my younger self as someone tough enough to handle my own sexuality .

What I realized, too, is that these exchanges weren’t offensive, they were playful; that they weren’t demeaning, but led to mutual respect. It was the very indecency of the back of house culture that made working at that 24-hour restaurant a tolerable job, and it was all the vulgar insults of the workplace that gave a kind of gritty dignity to our work there. Working there one became part of family. Flouting the rules that govern social niceties, which had to be observed carefully in the restaurant dining room, was the initiation into the clan. What I’ve learned since that summer is that the culture of that greasy spoon kitchen has a rich anthropology; it’s the type of community that populates the taverns of Shakespeare’s plays, for instance, and it functions in direct opposition to officialdom. Its currency is an abundance of filthy light-heartedness, and its economy subverts the normative claims of merit and respectability, those two pillars of social authority and middle-class morality. In the kitchen, the more horrible you are, the better! The profane and free culture of the kitchen was the antidote to the polite restraint of the dining room, as it is to ethic of rigid inoffensiveness that governs our politically correct culture.

What I experienced that summer are two related but distinct aspects of feminine sexual empowerment. The first was an awareness that it is the dirty jokes and sexual jibes of anti-official cultures that allow its members to feel a closeness to each other; it is a kind of solidarity achieved through a laughing disregard for formal decency. The sexual language of the back of house erased the social divisions that would normally demand our politeness. (Some of the line cooks were high-school dropouts; a few had criminal records. I was the daughter of civil engineer, attending private school, and on a fairly streamlined track to academic studies. And yet here I was, being teased by these guys, and in turn jabbing back at them, tit for tat.) What would now be considered clear-cut sexual harassment was the very thing that forged a true respect amongst us: the guys in the kitchen believed I was tough enough to take their insults. It was in their very coarseness that they treated me with honesty and equality. Treating me as a fragile young woman too delicate to handle their dirty comments, now that would be have been insulting!

The other component of female strength that I discovered that summer was the power inherent in my sexual self-restraint, or what historically has been known as “feminine virtue.” I’m certainly not advocating for any notion of sexual purity or for some cult of female chastity. Rather, what I’m suggesting is that there is a uniquely feminine power to say either yes or, as was the case with me, no. I felt connected to women’s history in a way we don’t hear about often today: I am empowered as a woman because I am a woman. I began to understand that feminine virtue instructs men in masculine virtue. At times, I returned a sexual comment not with another insult, but with an eyeroll, and sometimes I’d assert myself not by outdoing a dirty remark, but by activating codes of gallantry and manliness. A blush and a quiet “Alright. That’s enough,” would change the tone of the kitchen banter entirely. In contrast to the dining room where a polite separation existed between staff and customers, in the kitchen intimacy was displayed not just through insults but also through gentleness, and through gentlemanliness—and all it took was a blush! Resting on my feminine “weaker” nature was the way to control the social dynamic of the “toxic masculinity” of the back of house culture.

Before I go any further, I should make one thing clear: at 15 I was virginal and innocent, but I was in no way naïve—the constant crackling of the sexual tension in the kitchen of that 24-hour restaurant was instructive to me in other important ways: though I was beginning to develop a clear sense of my feminine power, I realized I was not invulnerable to predatory masculine sexuality. A large part of my tutelage that summer was in street smarts. Occasionally a table of men would come in who were real pigs. Not part of the working tribe, they had no claim to insult me with impunity. Their comments were often disgusting, and it was a humiliating experience—for them! I had by then learned the power of female scorn, and it worked pretty effectively to shut down lewd comments. Most of the time. Rarely, but occasionally, at the end of a shift, one of these men would still be lounging in a booth, drinking coffee and smoking without much else going on. I don’t know if any one of these guys ever posed an actual threat to me or to my female co-workers. We never took the chance to find out. If a shift ended late and it was dark out and one of the girls’ car was parked at the far end of the lot, she would ask one of the cooks or male servers to walk her out. And they always behaved like gentlemen when they did so—though they very likely were “harassing” us during the shift. This wasn’t seen by any of us as unfair or a double standard or in any way remarkable. It was just good common sense. As far as I know, even though that restaurant was open 24 hours and every night there would always be a rowdy post-midnight rush after the local bars shut their doors, not once was a female staff assaulted at work or while leaving it.

Yes, I have other female friends who weren’t so fortunate, and it ought to go without saying that the men who assaulted them should be subjected to the fullest rigour of the law. There is a tremendous difference, however, between coarse co-workers and dangerous misogynists; a difference between colleagues who tell a dirty joke and those who use coercion to elicit sex. Losing the ability to appreciate nuance is not a triumph of moral progress. It is stupidity masquerading as enlightenment. If we elide the two, then it is true that women will no longer feel the confusion and embarrassment I felt during my first couple of shifts. But we will also eliminate the opportunity for women to embody a position of strength and maturity that is only possible when confronted with sexual advances. There was nothing special about me as a 15 year-old girl. My sense of myself as a strong, free woman developed as a direct result of being subjected to the propositions of my coworkers. I said no. A lot. Saying no did not cause the jokes and the indecency to stop. Far from it. That part of restaurant culture remained very much alive. It was in fact an essential part of the health of the restaurant—funny though that sounds today—because it was accompanied by joy and toughness, and because it helped me to understand the power of my feminine sexual virtue. It felt like a superpower.

Contemporary feminism insists that the ideals of feminine virtue were a trick played on women by the patriarchy in order to keep female sexuality under control. Yet what I learned that summer was the opposite: my feminine virtue, traditionally understood, allowed me to control men. Women throughout the centuries have not primarily understood themselves as victims of patriarchal oppression—all one has to do is look to Jane Austen’s plucky heroines, or Shakespeare’s witty bar-wenches, or Chaucer’s sexual dynamo the Wife of Bath. But since the 1980s, young women, and men, have increasingly been taught that this has been the case, and we retroactively reinterpret the narratives of the past in order to reconfirm our own sense of moral progress. This has resulted, however, not in women becoming stronger, but rather in a pervasive culture of victimhood. One can’t be virtuous by the old standards, since those were devised by men to keep women oppressed, and one can’t claim to embody feminine virtue in itself, because that would essentialize gender, and we now know that gender is socially constructed. The only avenue left is to claim righteous indignation at the mistreatment of women by men. This is the narrative of perpetual victimization. It is a story of despair—plus it isn’t much fun!

Of course, a reasonable objection to the kind of sexually saturated culture I’m describing here is that an individual should be treated as a professional in their job, not as any kind of representative of gender and certainly not as a sexual object. Professional androgyny is the ideal. Yet I can’t think of a more Orwellian nightmare than everyone becoming reduced to their job, to their function in the service of… what? Corporate gain? Bureaucratic convenience? To their utility? As though the highest aim of humanity is to be treated as the mere conduit of some professional task?

Since my time at that restaurant, I have experienced professional sexual discrimination, and assault. I understand what it feels like. And I understand what a dirty joke feels like. If we have lost the ability to distinguish between the two, then there we are either a society of frankly stupid people who are calling a social triumph what is actually our inability to differentiate between coercive sexual threats and a kind of proletarian sexual rambunctiousness, or we are moving toward administrated and alienating human relations with a kind of gleeful despair. We are defining as justice what is really our transfer of sovereignty to impersonal and inhumane bureaucratic systems of authority.

If we maintain that a world without sexual commentary of any kind is better than a world in which one has to negotiate sexual advances—oh, the horror!—for oneself, then we are denying our young girls the opportunity to become strong, tough, and independent women who are capable of handling adult sexuality. If a joke is too much for us, then feminism has lost and it is time to bring out the Victorian fainting couch. When we enforce codes of behaviour that punish any kind of sexual suggestion or innuendo, we encourage the encroachment of officialdom, the rules that govern the polite formalities of the dining room, into the spaces that have traditionally operated in opposition to rigid authority. Human closeness and real respect is lost. And in its place reigns the totalitarian regime of institutionalized inoffensiveness.

It may be that contemporary consciousness raising feminism does not respect women, for it sees them as incapable of nuance and of being able to handle sexual situations. The coarse short order cooks who harassed the young 15 year-old hostess weren’t feminists. But they acted on the very premise that feminists once claimed as their own: they treated my younger self as someone tough enough to handle my own sexuality.

WASHINGTON — When Rep. Patrick Meehan announced his immediate resignation on Friday, he got rid of a big political headache: a pending ethics committee investigation into allegations that he sexually harassed a former female staffer and used taxpayer money to pay for a settlement.

Because the House Ethics Committee has no jurisdiction over lawmakers once they leave office, the panel will close its investigation. And although Meehan has promised to repay the taxpayer-funded settlement, there is no mechanism to ensure he makes good on that pledge.

“When members resign, they can evade accountability,” said Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy for Common Cause, a nonprofit group that advocates for strong ethics and campaign finance requirements.

“Voters don’t get the answers that they would otherwise get … and (lawmakers) are able to really put a cloak over whatever violations they may have committed,” Spaulding said.

Meehan is the second Republican House member to resign this month amid a similar controversy. Rep. Blake Farenthold resigned on April 6 in the face of an ethics probe after revelations that he relied on taxpayer money to pay an $84,000 settlement alleging he sexually harassed a former staffer.

Like Meehan, Farenthold promised to repay the $84,000 when he quit the House. But he has yet to do so, prompting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to say Farenthold should cover the cost of a special election to fill his unexpired term

The House voted earlier this year to change its sexual harassment policies — passing a bill in February that would require members of Congress to pay out of their own pockets for any sexual harassment settlements even after they leave office. That bill included a bevy of other reforms aimed at improving the way Congress handles sexual harassment cases and came in the wake of a national wave of sexual harassment scandals.

But that measure has stalled in the Senate. Democrats pushed to include the House-passed legislation in a broad spending bill that cleared Congress earlier this year, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reportedly objected.

A spokesman for McConnell said the GOP leader “supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.”

Sens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, said they are working on a compromise proposal and hope to release it in the coming weeks.

“The hold-up is, it’s still I think unclear if you look at the House language what the member of the House or Senate would have actually had to do before they would accept personal liability,” Blunt told USA Today on Tuesday. “If members are going to accept personal liability, they should know exactly how that personal liability is triggered.”

“I’m not quite sure where we’re going to wind up on how broad-based the individual liability is, but I am sure that we will want the members to understand what they’re liable for before they vote on it,” he said.

Klobuchar declined to answer specific questions about the negotiations. But the Minnesota Democrat said she expected they would be able to unveil a compromise measure next month.

Half a day after filing a lawsuit against disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein alleging defamation, sexual harassment and an effort to damage her career, Ashley Judd made her case on Good Morning America Tuesday.

""I lost opportunity, I lost money, I lost status and prestige and power in my career as a direct result of having been sexually harassed and rebuffing the sexual harassment,"" she told Amy Robach.

The suit, brought by firm Gibson Dunn, focuses on Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson's December comments to the New Zealand publication Stuff, in which he recalled Weinstein dissuading him from casting Judd or Mira Sorvino in Rings in the late 1990s. In the report, Jackson says he was ""fed false information"" about the professionalism of Judd, with whom he had met in 1998 to discuss a role in his planned adaptation of the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy novel.

Judd's lawsuit says that when Jackson and Walsh told Weinstein's company, which owned the rights to the Lord of the Rings films, that they wanted to cast Judd, ""Weinstein torpedoed Ms. Judd’s incredible professional opportunity when he told (them) that the studio had had a 'bad experience' with Ms. Judd, and that Ms. Judd was a 'nightmare' to work with and should be avoided 'at all costs.' ""

Judd was removed from the casting list for LOTR about a year after she rejected Weinstein's advances at a professional breakfast meeting in his hotel room, according to a news release detailing the lawsuit.

Judd told GMA she went from being on ""such a roll,"" career-wise, to seeing her career opportunities ""significantly diminished"" as a result of Weinstein's disparaging comments. Her suit, which characterizes Weinstein's actions as blacklisting, says he prevented her from working in an Oscar-winning film franchise and hurt her career going forward.

The lawsuit also states that Judd learned only late last year ""that something unseen was holding her back from obtaining the work she wanted, and had been doing so for decades. The headwind limiting her career was Harvey Weinstein, and specifically, the false and malicious statements he made regarding Ms. Judd’s professionalism as an actor"" to Jackson and Walsh.

The settlement would resolve lawsuits filed by dozens of women since 2017 , when The New York Times exposed allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Mr. Weinstein . Although the producer ’ s accusers include some of the highest-profile women in the entertainment world , such as Gwyneth Paltrow , Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek , none have joined the proceedings .

The process has been long and complicated , involving lawyers for the women , Mr. Weinstein , his former board members , creditors , insurers and the New York attorney general ’ s office . Last year , when the Weinstein Company entered bankruptcy , the accusers watched a potential settlement payout dwindle from a projected $ 90 million victims ’ fund that had been discussed as part of a possible sale of the studio . Then Eric T. Schneiderman , who as state attorney general had sued the studio and the Weinstein brothers and was steering settlement talks , resigned amid allegations that he had abused women .

But it could still fall apart because of objections by lawyers representing the dissenting women .
The narrow scope of Mr. Weinstein ’ s upcoming criminal trial only heightens the significance of the civil settlement , likely to be the only legal recourse for many of the women who said he abused them .

The Biden Campaign Is Advising Them To Say Her Story “Did Not Happen.”,,"Emmanuel Felton, Claudia Koerner, Rosie Gray","While Joe Biden has remained publicly silent about a sexual assault allegation made against him , his presidential campaign has sought to coordinate and unify Democratic messaging on the matter , advising surrogates earlier this month to say that the allegation “ did not happen . ”
The Biden campaign circulated talking points among top Democratic supporters shortly after the New York Times published a story earlier this month about the allegation by Tara Reade , a former staff assistant in Biden ’ s Senate office who says he assaulted her in 1993 .
With good news and bad , talking points are standard fare on presidential campaigns . In substance , the private guidance largely hews to the sole public statement on the matter from Biden ’ s deputy campaign manager , Kate Bedingfield .
But the messaging shows that while Biden has stayed quiet on the allegations on the eve of his nomination , aides were taking the claims seriously enough behind the scenes to coordinate messaging among other Democrats to try to cast the matter as one that ’ s been thoroughly vetted and determined to be unfounded .
“ Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed , ” the talking points read , according to a copy sent to two Democratic operatives . “ In this case , a thorough review by the New York Times has led to the truth : this incident did not happen . ”
“ Here ’ s the bottom line , ” they read . “ Vice President Joe Biden has spent over 40 years in public life : 36 years in the Senate ; 7 Senate campaigns , 2 previous presidential runs , two vice presidential campaigns , and 8 years in the White House . There has never been a complaint , allegation , hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him — ever . ”
Democrats are in an increasingly precarious position as reporters assess Reade ’ s allegation . By any measure of the # MeToo movement that has seen the Democratic Party embrace “ believe women ” as a mantra , Reade , 56 , has provided a serious account , disputed by Biden ’ s campaign and former senior staffers who worked in his office in 1993 but corroborated in part by people she told about the incident in the 1990s . This week , after Reade said her late mother had called Larry King Live about the incident , the Intercept published a transcript showing she called in to ask for advice about her daughter ’ s negative experience with a “ prominent senator . ”
Since news outlets began to investigate her claims , Biden has participated in more than a dozen television interviews and virtual fundraisers but has not addressed Reade ’ s allegation himself .
The guidance to top Democrats casts Biden as a lifelong “ fierce advocate for women ” and the claims as unequivocally untrue , leaning heavily on the April 12 report by the New York Times outlining the allegations by Reade .
Biden ’ s campaign ’ s talking points say the Times story served as proof that Reade ’ s allegation “ did not happen ” — but the story did not conclude this , nor did it conclude that an assault definitively did happen . The Times reported that three former Senate aides , all of whom Reade said she complained to at the time , either did not remember the incident or said that it did not happen . The Times also spoke to former interns who said they did remember Reade suddenly ceasing to oversee them , aligning with Reade ’ s claim that she was pulled from that duty .

In line with the guidance from Biden ’ s campaign , Democrats who have been asked about the story in recent weeks have pointed to the New York Times report and other stories , including in the Washington Post and the Associated Press , featuring denials by the three former Senate aides : two top staffers , Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman , as well as Biden ’ s executive assistant from 1982 to 2000 , Marianne Baker .

Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent podcast interview that Reade “ has a right to tell her story ” and that she could “ only speak to the Joe Biden I know . He ’ s been a lifelong fighter , in terms of stopping violence against women . ”
“ Vice President Biden has a strong record for fighting for women in his life , ” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , a fierce # MeToo advocate , in a radio interview earlier this month .
“ We are right now at the investigation stage of the allegation . ”
The talking points obtained by ███ are printed below :","While Joe Biden has remained publicly silent about a sexual assault allegation made against him, his presidential campaign has sought to coordinate and unify Democratic messaging on the matter, advising surrogates earlier this month to say that the allegation “did not happen.”

The Biden campaign circulated talking points among top Democratic supporters shortly after the New York Times published a story earlier this month about the allegation by Tara Reade, a former staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office who says he assaulted her in 1993.

With good news and bad, talking points are standard fare on presidential campaigns. In substance, the private guidance largely hews to the sole public statement on the matter from Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield.

But the messaging shows that while Biden has stayed quiet on the allegations on the eve of his nomination, aides were taking the claims seriously enough behind the scenes to coordinate messaging among other Democrats to try to cast the matter as one that’s been thoroughly vetted and determined to be unfounded.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” the talking points read, according to a copy sent to two Democratic operatives. “In this case, a thorough review by the New York Times has led to the truth: this incident did not happen.”

“Here’s the bottom line,” they read. “Vice President Joe Biden has spent over 40 years in public life: 36 years in the Senate; 7 Senate campaigns, 2 previous presidential runs, two vice presidential campaigns, and 8 years in the White House. There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him — ever.”

Democrats are in an increasingly precarious position as reporters assess Reade’s allegation. By any measure of the #MeToo movement that has seen the Democratic Party embrace “believe women” as a mantra, Reade, 56, has provided a serious account, disputed by Biden’s campaign and former senior staffers who worked in his office in 1993 but corroborated in part by people she told about the incident in the 1990s. This week, after Reade said her late mother had called Larry King Live about the incident, the Intercept published a transcript showing she called in to ask for advice about her daughter’s negative experience with a “prominent senator.”



Since news outlets began to investigate her claims, Biden has participated in more than a dozen television interviews and virtual fundraisers but has not addressed Reade’s allegation himself.

The guidance to top Democrats casts Biden as a lifelong “fierce advocate for women” and the claims as unequivocally untrue, leaning heavily on the April 12 report by the New York Times outlining the allegations by Reade.

Biden’s campaign’s talking points say the Times story served as proof that Reade’s allegation “did not happen” — but the story did not conclude this, nor did it conclude that an assault definitively did happen. The Times reported that three former Senate aides, all of whom Reade said she complained to at the time, either did not remember the incident or said that it did not happen. The Times also spoke to former interns who said they did remember Reade suddenly ceasing to oversee them, aligning with Reade’s claim that she was pulled from that duty.



Reade has said that Biden digitally penetrated her in a Senate hallway and told her, “You’re nothing to me.” In multiple interviews with several outlets, Reade has said she complained to others in Biden’s office, filed a report at the time to a Senate personnel office, and said she was demoted after the incident. Reade stood by her recollections in interviews with BuzzFeed News this month.

“All four of the people Mrs. Reade says were notified of an official complaint told the New York Times on the record that they have absolutely no recollection of any such conversation,” the Biden campaign told Democrats, echoing testimonials from former staffers who have painted the claims as “so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

Moonves, 68, has run CBS since 2006 and his exit marks a dramatic fall by one by the most powerful executives in Hollywood.

The allegations, reported by Ronan Farrow, include forced kissing, forced oral sex, unwanted advances and physical abuse. Some of the women say Moonves retaliated against them and that their careers suffered after they rebuffed his advances.

Moonves has denied the allegations against him. In a new statement to The New Yorker, Moonves acknowledged three of the encounters but said they were consensual. He did not tell The New Yorker which three he was acknowledging.

""The appalling accusations in this article are untrue,"" the statement reads. ""What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career.

Farrow said the women who made allegations in his most recent story had no connection to the ""corporate battles"" at CBS.

In August, the CBS board of directors hired two outside law firms to investigate the initial claims against Moonves, as well as other reports of sexual harassment and an inappropriate culture for women throughout CBS and the CBS News division.

Jeffrey Fager, the executive producer of ""60 Minutes,"" was accused by former employees of inappropriate conduct in the initial New Yorker story in July. He has denied the allegations.

Sunday's report from Farrow also includes a new allegation against Fager. Sarah Johansen, who was an intern in the late 2000s, says Fager once groped her at an office function and described the culture as ""sexist"" and a ""boy's club.""

Moonves joined the former CBS Corporation in 1995 as president of CBS Entertainment. He has been chairman and CEO of CBS Corporation since 2006. In the late 1980s, he was an executive at Lorimar Television.

CBS owns the CBS TV network, cable network Showtime and the publisher Simon & Schuster.

Moonves had been in a corporate battle with Shari Redstone, controlling shareholder in CBS through her company National Amusements, which also controls Viacom.

Viacom controls several major cable networks, including Comedy Central, MTV and BET, and movie studio Paramount.

Redstone had been pushing to merge CBS and Viacom, and Moonves had opposed the move.

As part of the agreement announced Sunday, Redstone agreed that the company would not pursue a combination of CBS and Viacom for at least two years.

""Today's resolution will benefit all shareholders, allowing us to focus on the business of running CBS — and transforming it for the future. We are confident in Joe's ability to serve as acting CEO,"" Redstone said.

Viacom and CBS first merged in 1999, and split up in 2005. At the time, the bet was that Viacom had the greater growth potential. But under Moonves, CBS' stock has soared while Viacom's has been relatively flat.

That turned Moonves into one of this highest paid executives in America: He took home nearly $70 million in each of the past two years.
