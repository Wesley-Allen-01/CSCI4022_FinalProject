Reade was among the women who came out last year alleging Biden was too handsy but did not make her allegation of sexual assault until speaking with journalist Katie Halper for her 'Katie Halper Show ' podcast on March 25 .

Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assaulting her in high school, has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her attorneys said Saturday.

Bipartisan negotiators have tentatively agreed to work toward a Thursday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanaugh and Ford, but talks continue on a final agreement, according to multiple congressional sources.

In an email to the committee, lawyers for Ford said that while she has agreed to ""provide first-hand knowledge of Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct,"" they are disappointed ""with the leaks and bullying that have tainted the process.""

The timing and terms of the hearing are still unclear, as negotiations continue between Ford's attorneys and the Senate Judiciary Committee, but in a letter, Ford's lawyers said they were ""hopeful that we can reach agreement on details.""

The email also indicated that Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general of the Justice Department, has joined Ford's team of lawyers. Bromwich currently represents former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year.

Ford alleges Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would appear before the committee next week.

sexual_misconduct,The Week - Opinion,0,https://www.theweek.com/articles/911495/how-tara-reades-allegations-could-bring-down-joe-biden,How Tara Reade's allegations could bring down Joe Biden,2020-04-29,"Damon Linker, Joel Mathis, Ryan Cooper","Earlier this month , I wrote a column asking what Democrats should do about sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden , the party 's presumptive nominee for president . My answer ? Not much . The accusation made by Tara Reade , a former Biden staffer from his days in the Senate during the early 1990s , did n't strike me as especially convincing , so Democrats , I suggested , could move forward without much concern . Though toward the end of the column I included two caveats : If Reade offered further corroboration of her claims or if evidence emerged of a larger pattern of abusive actions toward women on Biden 's part , that could well change my views of the matter .
Just two weeks later , both of my conditions have been met .
Last week we learned that Reade 's mother called into the Larry King Show in 1993 to talk about how her daughter had quit working for a `` prominent senator '' after unspecified `` problems '' as a staffer . Then earlier this week Business Insider reported that a former neighbor of Reade 's ( a self-described `` strong Democrat '' ) recalls a conversation with her in 1995 or 1996 in which Reade tearfully described being sexually assaulted by Biden . Together , those two stories help to corroborate Reade 's specific claim about herself .
Finally , on Tuesday , a 2008 essay by the late Alexander Cockburn surfaced in which the journalist reported that Biden had made `` unwelcome and unwanted '' sexual advances against a woman in 1972 or 1973 . That establishes a possible longstanding pattern of Biden 's behavior that further validates Reade 's accusation ( and potentially opens the door to others ) .
In light of these revelations , the time has come for a two new questions : Can Biden survive the gathering storm around Tara Reade 's allegations ? And if so , will that fact be good or bad for the Democratic Party in November ?
The first question is the easier one to answer : Biden 's presumptive nomination is quite likely to survive the corroboration of Reade 's claims . That 's because members of Biden 's electoral base in the Democratic Party — older , culturally moderate white working-class voters in the Midwest and older , culturally moderate African Americans — are unlikely to be turned against him by one corroborated allegation of sexual assault from nearly three decades in the past . If anything , rank-and-file Democrats have expressed regret that some # MeToo allegations have taken down popular members of the party ( former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken is the example cited most frequently ) — and they 're also irritated that Democrats are expected to adhere to standards their opponents openly flout .
The factions of the party most likely to turn on Biden because of a sexual-assault scandal are those who 've been least wedded to his candidacy from the start — those firmly on the left , who supported Sen.

Sign up for The Week 's `` Today 's best articles '' newsletter here .","Earlier this month, I wrote a column asking what Democrats should do about sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden, the party's presumptive nominee for president. My answer? Not much. The accusation made by Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer from his days in the Senate during the early 1990s, didn't strike me as especially convincing, so Democrats, I suggested, could move forward without much concern. Though toward the end of the column I included two caveats: If Reade offered further corroboration of her claims or if evidence emerged of a larger pattern of abusive actions toward women on Biden's part, that could well change my views of the matter.

Just two weeks later, both of my conditions have been met.

Last week we learned that Reade's mother called into the Larry King Show in 1993 to talk about how her daughter had quit working for a ""prominent senator"" after unspecified ""problems"" as a staffer. Then earlier this week Business Insider reported that a former neighbor of Reade's (a self-described ""strong Democrat"") recalls a conversation with her in 1995 or 1996 in which Reade tearfully described being sexually assaulted by Biden. Together, those two stories help to corroborate Reade's specific claim about herself.

Finally, on Tuesday, a 2008 essay by the late Alexander Cockburn surfaced in which the journalist reported that Biden had made ""unwelcome and unwanted"" sexual advances against a woman in 1972 or 1973. That establishes a possible longstanding pattern of Biden's behavior that further validates Reade's accusation (and potentially opens the door to others).

In light of these revelations, the time has come for a two new questions: Can Biden survive the gathering storm around Tara Reade's allegations? And if so, will that fact be good or bad for the Democratic Party in November?

The first question is the easier one to answer: Biden's presumptive nomination is quite likely to survive the corroboration of Reade's claims. That's because members of Biden's electoral base in the Democratic Party — older, culturally moderate white working-class voters in the Midwest and older, culturally moderate African Americans — are unlikely to be turned against him by one corroborated allegation of sexual assault from nearly three decades in the past. If anything, rank-and-file Democrats have expressed regret that some #MeToo allegations have taken down popular members of the party (former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken is the example cited most frequently) — and they're also irritated that Democrats are expected to adhere to standards their opponents openly flout.

The factions of the party most likely to turn on Biden because of a sexual-assault scandal are those who've been least wedded to his candidacy from the start — those firmly on the left, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders; and white urban progressives, who tended to favor Sen. Elizabeth Warren's candidacy. Neither group possesses the numbers or influence in the party to get it to overrule the preferences of the other two electorally crucial factions — and obviously their opinions will also carry little weight with the candidate himself. This means that, so long as no additional corroborated accusations materialize, Biden will most likely get to hold onto the nomination if he wants to.

That might turn out to be a very bad thing for the party come November.

But how could this be? How could a sexual assault allegation place Biden at a disadvantage in the general election against President Trump, a man who has openly bragged on tape of sexual assault and has himself been accused of rape on multiple occasions?

On substance, Trump will have zero moral ground to stand on. But he won't be taking a stand in the name of treating women with respect. Neither will he be accusing Biden of being a sexual predator. Instead, he and the entire Republican noise machine will constantly, relentlessly hammer Biden, leading Democrats, and the media for flagrant hypocrisy and double standards. The moral content of the issue won't matter one bit. What will matter is that Biden has set himself up as a moral arbiter on issues of sexual harassment and violence, insisting we must ""believe all women,"" and that in the fall of 2018 he and many other members of his party sought to destroy the reputation of Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for allegations of sexual assault that were less convincingly corroborated than those Reade has lodged against Biden.

The Democratic nominee for president and his party are ruthless political operators who seek above all else to destroy their enemies and help themselves, all the while setting themselves up as impartial moral authorities. This will be the message, driven home over and over again: that claims of purity and impartiality are pretense, transparent fakes. Democrats might posture like they're better than Republicans, including the president, but they aren't. They're every bit as bad. They're just more dishonest about it.

The Biden campaign's effort to portray itself as a moral reset from the debasement of the Trump years will run into this counter-message like a power sander. The Trump campaign will strip it away with a barrage of paid ads, prime-time cable news diatribes, and a hailstorm of tweets — all of it repeating the message (illustrated with clips from and about the Kavanaugh hearings) that Biden and his fellow Democrats are every bit the BS artists that Trump is, only they won't admit it. They'll lie about it, right to your face.

To Democrats this prediction may sound implausible. There's no way that Trump, a man whose mendaciousness is well established and total, can possibly succeed in portraying Biden as more dishonest than he is. But he won't have to show that Biden is worse, just that he's no better.

That's Trump's (perhaps only) winning move — to bring the playing field down to his level, to lower Biden's favorability rating, to make him seem less admirable, less likable, less morally upstanding, less … superior than Trump. He did the same thing against Hillary Clinton in 2016, using the FBI investigation of her email practices while secretary of state as a cudgel. Last summer, the strategy was to impugn Biden's son, making them both look like corrupt wheeler dealers in Ukraine. That didn't work out, but now Reade's allegations have made it possible for Trump and his party to do what they love most of all, which is to accuse Democrats and the media of smarmy double standards instead.

Of course this won't work with most Democratic voters, but that won't be its aim. The aim will be to ensure maximal turnout and Trump loyalty among Republicans — and the destruction of Biden's reputation among independents in crucial swing states.

Will it succeed? Trump will be facing re-election while presiding over a deadly pandemic and the early stages of an economic depression, so who knows. What I do know is that the behavior Tara Reade has plausibly alleged about the presumptive Democratic nominee is going to be a major liability for him as we head toward Election Day.

sexual_misconduct,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-allegation/index.html,Biden denies sexual assault allegation: 'This never happened',2020-05-01,"Eric Bradner, Mj Lee","( CNN ) Joe Biden released a statement Friday denying a former aide 's claims he sexually assaulted her 27 years ago , saying of Tara Reade 's allegation : `` This never happened . ''
Friday 's statement is the first detailed response from Biden to Reade 's allegation and comes as pressure built on the presumptive Democratic nominee to personally address the matter .
`` While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated , two things are not complicated . One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect , and when they step forward they should be heard , not silenced . The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny , '' the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in the statement .
He continued , `` Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story , which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways . ''
`` But this much bears emphasizing , '' he said . `` She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time . They -- both men and a woman -- have said , unequivocally , that she never came to them and complained or raised issues . News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one -- not one -- who corroborated her allegations in any way . Indeed , many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way -- as indeed I would not have . ''
In the MSNBC interview , Biden said he is `` saying unequivocally , it never , never happened . It did n't . It never happened . ''
He said he has not reached out to Reade , and does not remember her making any complaint .
`` This never happened , and when she first made the claim , we made it clear that it never happened , and it 's as simple as that , '' he said .
Biden 's only response for weeks has been a statement from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield highlighting the former vice president 's role in crafting the Violence Against Women Act and saying what Reade had claimed `` absolutely did not happen . '' Former Biden staffers also said Reade had not complained about Biden at the time .
The allegation comes as Biden is preparing to take on President Donald Trump in the general election . More than a dozen women have leveled allegations against Trump , ranging from unwelcome advances to sexual harassment and assault . Trump has denied those allegations .
For some of Biden 's supporters and surrogates , questions related to Reade 's allegation have presented a challenging balancing act -- of expressing support for Biden 's candidacy and character while not dismissing a sexual assault allegation . Democrats in particular have vocally championed the # MeToo movement in recent years , advocating that all accusers to be fully heard and recognized . And gender dynamics are expected to remain at the forefront of the 2020 race , as Biden begins his search for a female running mate .
Some of the women widely expected to be on Biden 's shortlist of vice presidential nominees , including Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , have recently been asked about the allegation ; Biden 's allies have pointed to his decades-long advocacy for women and victims of abuse , including his work on the Violence Against Women Act .
Biden said in the MSNBC interview he did not know why Reade was now alleging he had sexually assaulted her .
`` I 'm not going to question her motive , '' he said . `` I do n't know why she 's saying this . I do n't know why after 27 years all of a sudden this gets raised . I do n't understand it . ''
`` She has a right to say whatever she wants to say . But I have a right to say , look at the facts , '' he said .
Reade , who worked as a junior staffer at Biden 's office in 1993 , had publicly accused Biden last year of touching her shoulders and neck and making her feel uncomfortable .
Reade first came forward with her sexual assault allegation against Biden in interviews this year with multiple media outlets , including CNN .
She told CNN that in 1993 , when she was working as an aide in Biden 's Senate office , she was asked to deliver a duffel bag to the then-Delaware senator . In a corridor somewhere in the Capitol Hill complex , Reade said Biden `` had me up against the wall ; he used his knee to spread open my legs , '' and `` put his fingers inside me . ''
A friend of Reade 's , who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect her privacy , told CNN that Reade had told her in detail that she had been sexually assaulted by Biden on Capitol Hill . The friend said she believes Reade called her within days of the alleged assault .
former neighbor of Reade has come forward and told CNN that Reade told her about the alleged assault within a few years of the incident , in the mid-1990s , and a newly surfaced video from 1993 appears to feature Reade 's mother calling into `` Larry King Live '' to seek advice around the time of the alleged assault about how to handle `` problems '' her daughter had while working for a prominent US senator . Reade told CNN that she is certain the voice in the video belongs to her mother , Jeanette Altimus , who died a few years ago .
The Washington Post interviewed Reade 's brother , Collin Moulton , who told the paper that she had told him in 1993 that Biden had `` behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders '' but not about the alleged sexual assault . Several days after that interview with Reade 's brother , the Post said , `` he said in a text message that he recalled her telling him that Biden had put his hand 'under her clothes . ' ''
Moulton later told CNN in a text message that Reade told him in the early 1990s that she had been asked to bring Biden his gym bag , and that in a private setting , he had cornered her against the wall and put his hands under her clothes .
Reade has said that she complained to multiple colleagues in the office about interactions with Biden that made her uncomfortable , but not about the alleged assault . Reade has also said that she filed a complaint with a personnel office on Capitol Hill at the time , but that she does not have a copy of it . It is unclear what kind of complaint -- and at what office -- Reade may have filed .
Pressure has mounted on Biden to release his papers from his Senate days , which some say could shed light on the allegation . Those papers are at the University of Delaware and will not be made publicly available until two years after Biden leaves public life .
The university said this week it is still curating the collection of documents , a process expected to last into the spring of 2021 . Therefore , a university spokesperson said Thursday , it can not identify what documents and files can be found in the collection .
Biden says his papers at the university do not contain personnel files . But , he said , personnel files from the Senate during those days would be kept at the National Archives .
`` I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document . If there was ever any such complaint , the record will be there , '' Biden said .
Later on Friday afternoon , Biden sent a letter to the secretary of the Senate asking that office to work with the National Archives to locate and release any complaint from Reade as well as `` any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation . '' The National Archives said in an email to CNN that any personnel complaints from 1993 would have `` remained under the control of the Senate . ''
`` I am writing to request your assistance in determining whether 27 years ago a staff member in my United States Senate office filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment , '' Biden wrote . `` According to public reports , the staff member , Ms. Tara Reade , has stated that in 1993 she filed such a complaint with the office responsible for enforcing Senate employees ' rights in the workplace . ''
He added , `` I request that you take or direct whatever steps are necessary to establish the location of the records of this Office , and once they have been located , to direct a search for the alleged complaint and to make public the results of this search . I would ask that the public release include not only a complaint if one exists , but any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation . ''
Biden also said on MSNBC that the his papers at the University of Delaware will remain sealed because they could become political `` fodder '' during his presidential campaign .
`` The idea that they would all be made public while I was running for office can be taken out of context , '' Biden said . He added that the documents would cover topics like meetings with foreign heads of state .
Asked whether he would release all complaints against him , Biden said , `` I 'm prepared to do that , '' and that to the best of his knowledge there are no claims of sexual misconduct on his part .
CNN has interviewed half a dozen former Biden aides who worked in his Senate office in the early 1990s . All of them said they were not aware of any sexual harassment or assault allegations .
Marianne Baker , who was Biden 's executive assistant in the 1980s and 1990s when Biden was a senator , also previously said in a statement provided through the Biden campaign that she was never aware of any reports of inappropriate conduct , including from Reade .
`` In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period -- not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone . I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade 's accounting of events , which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional , and as a manager , '' Baker said . `` These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades . ''
Dennis Toner , who was Biden 's deputy chief of staff at the time and one of the people Reade said she had discussed her complaints with , told CNN in an interview on Thursday that he had no recollection of Reade or any conversation related to sexual harassment allegations .
`` I clearly would remember if we -- that is , if Tara and myself -- had any kind of conversation regarding sexual harassment allegations , let alone something involving Sen. Biden . It would stick in my mind . It would be burned in my mind , '' Toner said . `` I do n't understand it . ''

Now that Reade has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, never mind.",2020-04-29,,"In early October 2018 , amidst the hysteria surrounding the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , I wrote an opinion piece for ███ questioning the wisdom of the “ believe all women ” rhetoric that many cited in condemning Justice Kavanaugh , without any critical analysis of the allegation against him .
Less than two years later , the biggest proponents of this movement at the time of the Kavanaugh hearing seem to be backtracking on its logic .
Joe Biden , the presumptive Democratic nominee for president , has been plagued by allegations ranging from not respecting personal space to unwanted touching , culminating now with an allegation of actual sexual assault by a former Senate aide named Tara Reade . The debate , as with Kavanaugh , is whether this assault actually happened . But the analysis this go-round is quite different .
According to the traditional # MeToo logic , there is automatically enough evidence to believe the Reade allegation and to destroy Biden ’ s career as a result . On its face , this case should be a straightforward application of the “ believe all women ” approach .
But the calculus has suddenly changed now that it is a Democrat on the receiving end . Many in the # MeToo movement have traditionally interpreted the noble goal of eradicating sexual violence from our society to mean that you must “ believe all women. ” Now , those same people are backtracking on their own advice .
One of them , actress Alyssa Milano , famously tweeted in 2017 , “ If you ’ ve been sexually harassed or assaulted , write ‘ me too ’ as a reply to this tweet ” — and caused the movement to go viral .
This month , Milano revisited the topic to explain her self-described “ silence ” over the sexual assault allegations against Biden . “ I just don ’ t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I ’ ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation , ” she said in a SiriusXM interview .
And that is precisely the point . No one — not Kavanaugh , and not Biden — deserves a snap judgment determination of guilt based solely upon the word of an accuser without a “ thorough investigation ” yielding some form of corroboration . This is an obvious truth that people like Milano have chosen to ignore until it served them , politically or otherwise .
As a criminal defense attorney specializing in sexual assault defense — and a former federal special victims ’ prosecutor of these same cases — I can assure you that corroboration is key to any claim of sexual assault , particularly one in which there is a delayed report . On the topic of corroboration , then , Reade ’ s allegation is far and away from the stronger of the two .

Opinion contributor

In early October 2018, amidst the hysteria surrounding the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, I wrote an opinion piece for USA TODAY questioning the wisdom of the “believe all women” rhetoric that many cited in condemning Justice Kavanaugh, without any critical analysis of the allegation against him.

Less than two years later, the biggest proponents of this movement at the time of the Kavanaugh hearing seem to be backtracking on its logic.

Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has been plagued by allegations ranging from not respecting personal space to unwanted touching, culminating now with an allegation of actual sexual assault by a former Senate aide named Tara Reade. The debate, as with Kavanaugh, is whether this assault actually happened. But the analysis this go-round is quite different.

According to the traditional #MeToo logic, there is automatically enough evidence to believe the Reade allegation and to destroy Biden’s career as a result. On its face, this case should be a straightforward application of the “believe all women” approach.

Backtracking on believing women

But the calculus has suddenly changed now that it is a Democrat on the receiving end. Many in the #MeToo movement have traditionally interpreted the noble goal of eradicating sexual violence from our society to mean that you must “believe all women.” Now, those same people are backtracking on their own advice.

One of them, actress Alyssa Milano, famously tweeted in 2017, “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted, write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet” — and caused the movement to go viral.

This month, Milano revisited the topic to explain her self-described “silence” over the sexual assault allegations against Biden. “I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation,” she said in a SiriusXM interview.

And that is precisely the point. No one — not Kavanaugh, and not Biden — deserves a snap judgment determination of guilt based solely upon the word of an accuser without a “thorough investigation” yielding some form of corroboration. This is an obvious truth that people like Milano have chosen to ignore until it served them, politically or otherwise.

As a criminal defense attorney specializing in sexual assault defense — and a former federal special victims’ prosecutor of these same cases — I can assure you that corroboration is key to any claim of sexual assault, particularly one in which there is a delayed report. On the topic of corroboration, then, Reade’s allegation is far and away from the stronger of the two. She presents a plausible narrative of sexual assault compared with Christine Blasey Ford’s more fantastical allegation against Kavanaugh.

Biden's #MeToo problem:If Joe Biden wants due process in his sexual assault case, he should back it for others

One of Reade’s friends and her brother confirm hearing about a version of the incident at the time; another was told a few years later.

And now there is a recording corroborating Reade’s earlier report that her late mother had called into the ""Larry King Live"" show in 1993 about the incident, though without specifically describing it. In other words, there is a far more credible history of Reade’s allegation than that presented by Ford.

Ford’s friend whom she presented to corroborate her claim denied knowing Kavanaugh or remembering being at a party with him. In fact, not a single soul could back up her story.

Shocked at brazen hypocrisy

I am not writing this, however, to convince one way or another about the truth of Reade’s allegation. I am writing this solely in an effort to persuade all of us to respectfully and critically analyze any claim of sexual misconduct before leaping to judgment, particularly when the consequences of such an allegation have extremely far-reaching implications for people’s careers and lives.

I am writing this also because I am truly shocked at the brazen hypocrisy I have seen with respect to Reade’s allegation. It is not enough for some people to suggest that they “do not know” whether Reade’s allegation is true. Instead, the very same individuals who “stood with Christine Blasey Ford” and “believed her,” despite all logical evidence to the contrary, now declare that they are all but certain Reade (a woman with a decidedly more corroborated allegation of sexual assault) is a liar. Simply and obviously because, if true, her allegation threatens the nomination of their preferred presidential candidate.

Biden's Trump card:Death, disease and economic pain are real. They can't be spun.

And so it is that the very people who gave life to the “believe all women” movement are single-handedly responsible for its unceremonious death.

But this is not a bad thing. The movement never had any place among the intellectual and reasoned analysis that all allegations of this nature should enjoy. Democrats and Republicans alike can commit heinous acts, and likewise can be falsely accused of such. But no matter one’s political affiliation, we are all entitled to the presumption of innocence pending evidence to the contrary.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh spoke to Fox News in an interview aired Monday night on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" following allegations of sexual misconduct by two women.

Sitting next to his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, the nominee flatly refuted the accusations as he sought to defend himself days before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to have another hearing on his confirmation. President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court.

That vote on Kavanaugh's nomination has been pushed back so he can answer allegations leveled by one of his accusers: psychology researcher and Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford. She alleges that, while both were in high school, Kavanaugh held her down, put his hand over her mouth to silence her, and tried to remove her clothes.

A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh's, claims that he exposed himself to her and shoved his penis in her face at a dorm room party in their freshman year at the Ivy League school. She said they were playing a drinking game at the time and admits there are gaps in her memory of that night.

Here are five takeaways from the interview:

Kavanaugh a 'virgin' in high school

The judge said he never had sexual intercourse ""or anything close to (it)"" until long after he left Georgetown Prep, the elite all-boys Catholic high school he attended in Rockville, Maryland.

“So you’re saying through all these years that are in question that you were a virgin?” MacCallum asked Kavanaugh.

“That’s correct,"" he replied.

She pressed on: “And through what years in college, since we’re probing into your personal life here?”

“Many years after, I’ll leave it at that,"" he answered. ""Many years after.""

Kavanaugh was emphatic in his denials

“The truth is I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise. I am not questioning and have not questioned that perhaps Dr. Ford at some point in her life was sexually assaulted by someone at some place, but what I know is I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone,” Kavanaugh said.

He went further by saying he wasn't even in the same place where Ford was when the alleged assault took place.

“I was never at any such party,"" he told MacCallum. ""The other people who alleged to be present have said they do not remember any such party. A woman who was present, another woman who was present who was Dr. Ford’s lifelong friend has said she doesn’t know me and never remembers being at a party with me at any time in her life.”

The judge said he won't withdraw

Kavanaugh appears resolute about his desire to be confirmed to the nation's highest court.

“I’m not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process and we’re looking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend my integrity, my lifelong record,"" Kavanaugh said.

""My lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old,"" he continued. ""I’m not going anywhere.”

So far, Trump is standing by his pick. He told reporters during an appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Kavanaugh ""is an absolutely outstanding person. Hopefully he will be confirmed quickly.""

He spoke with his wife at his side

Ashley Kavanaugh sat next to her husband as he forcefully defended himself.

Often nodding in agreement as the judge spoke, Ashley Kavanaugh said she's known him for 17 years and described him as ""decent ... kind ... and good"" as she defended him.

""It's been very difficult to have these conversations with your children,"" she told MacCallum. ""But they know Brett and they know the truth. And we told them from the very beginning of this process this will be not fun sometimes. You're going to hear things. People feel strongly and you need to know that. Just remember you know your dad.""

Ashley Kavanaugh was the personal secretary to President George W. Bush when Brett Kavanaugh worked in the White House. His first date with his future bride was Sept. 10, 2001. The next morning, they were among those whisked out of the White House during the 9/11 attacks.

He chose a friendly audience for the interview

Kavanaugh chose Fox News for his only interview – so far – to refute the allegations.

MacCallum, who joined Fox News Channel in 2004, is one of the more prominent personalities on a network that features Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera and Brit Hume.

She did not pull punches.

MacCallum pointedly asked Kavanaugh to address: the specific allegations (he repeatedly refuted them); whether he had ever blacked out from drinking too much in high school (he said that never happened); and whether similar allegations by someone in high school should count against them later in life (""I think everyone's judged on their whole life,"" he responded.)

Thirty-three years ago , she was the administration official 's wife accusing her prominent spouse of serial abuse . Her then-husband , John Fedders , was the tall , handsome lawyer with a very different public image than the one his family saw at home . Like Jennifer Willoughby , ex-wife of President Trump 's former staff secretary Rob Porter , Charlotte Fedders says she , too , was regularly called the same abusive name `` to the point where it did n't mean too much anymore . ''
Fedders ' 1987 bestselling book , Shattered Dreams , became a TV movie starring Lindsay Wagner .
`` It has just brought too many memories with all the similarities , '' Fedders says , citing her own black eyes and broken window . `` It ’ s been hard . ''
Back then , Fedders said , no one talked about this kind of abuse in the upper-middle-class , country-club world she then inhabited . So she stayed for 17 years after her 1966 wedding through the belittling , the physical abuse — including during her first pregnancy — and the weeks of silent treatment she and their children often got .
`` I thought we had put a lot of this stuff behind us , us as a country , '' says Fedders , 74 . `` And it 's very disturbing to know that someone would be in the White House that close to the president without a full security clearance with this past that people knew about . ''
One prominent difference between Fedders and the Porter story : She says she `` never said a thing '' about the abuse when administration officials were vetting her ex-husband to be the chief of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission .
`` I was afraid I ’ d be in real trouble if he found out , '' Fedders says .
Women in prominent , affluent families may tolerate physical and emotional abuse because of fears that disclosure could harm families ' reputations and careers , pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris writes in her new book The Deepest Well , which examines the health effects of these experiences on children .
When more affluent people do n't talk about domestic violence , the problem continues , and it perpetuates the idea that `` adversity is a problem for only certain communities , '' wrote Harris , who heads the Center for Youth Wellness in San Francisco .
Domestic abuse survivor and advocate L.Y . Marlow grew up in Philadelphia housing projects but knew stigma about abuse is spread across socioeconomic , racial and ethnic groups . A decade ago , she launched the advocacy group Saving Promise , named after her granddaughter , Promise , who Marlow wanted to prevent from becoming the fifth generation of women in her family to become domestic abuse victims .
`` Unfortunately , sometimes it takes high-visibility people and circumstances for something to become part of the national agenda , '' says Marlow , whose group is working with the Harvard school of public health on domestic violence prevention . `` The 'Me Too ' and 'Time 's Up ' movements did n't get elevated until celebrities said something , even though the other stories are no less important . ''
When Fedders recently read a blog post Willoughby wrote last April , titled `` Why I Stayed , '' it was like she could have written parts about her own former life .
`` Everyone loved him , '' Willoughby wrote . `` People commented all the time how lucky I was . ''
People used to say that about Fedders ' 6-foot-10 ex-husband , too , including that `` He just must be so wonderful to live with as he 's extremely charming and smart , '' she says .

USA TODAY

The domestic violence news out of the White House this month was all too familiar to Charlotte Fedders.

Thirty-three years ago, she was the administration official's wife accusing her prominent spouse of serial abuse. Her then-husband, John Fedders, was the tall, handsome lawyer with a very different public image than the one his family saw at home. Like Jennifer Willoughby, ex-wife of President Trump's former staff secretary Rob Porter, Charlotte Fedders says she, too, was regularly called the same abusive name ""to the point where it didn't mean too much anymore.""

Fedders' 1987 bestselling book, Shattered Dreams, became a TV movie starring Lindsay Wagner.

""It has just brought too many memories with all the similarities,"" Fedders says, citing her own black eyes and broken window. ""It’s been hard.""

Back then, Fedders said, no one talked about this kind of abuse in the upper-middle-class, country-club world she then inhabited. So she stayed for 17 years after her 1966 wedding through the belittling, the physical abuse — including during her first pregnancy — and the weeks of silent treatment she and their children often got.

Fedders says she thought things had changed.

""I thought we had put a lot of this stuff behind us, us as a country,"" says Fedders, 74. ""And it's very disturbing to know that someone would be in the White House that close to the president without a full security clearance with this past that people knew about.""

One prominent difference between Fedders and the Porter story: She says she ""never said a thing"" about the abuse when administration officials were vetting her ex-husband to be the chief of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""I was afraid I’d be in real trouble if he found out,"" Fedders says.

Why women tolerate abuse

Women in prominent, affluent families may tolerate physical and emotional abuse because of fears that disclosure could harm families' reputations and careers, pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris writes in her new book The Deepest Well, which examines the health effects of these experiences on children.

When more affluent people don't talk about domestic violence, the problem continues, and it perpetuates the idea that ""adversity is a problem for only certain communities,"" wrote Harris, who heads the Center for Youth Wellness in San Francisco.

Domestic abuse survivor and advocate L.Y. Marlow grew up in Philadelphia housing projects but knew stigma about abuse is spread across socioeconomic, racial and ethnic groups. A decade ago, she launched the advocacy group Saving Promise, named after her granddaughter, Promise, who Marlow wanted to prevent from becoming the fifth generation of women in her family to become domestic abuse victims.

""Unfortunately, sometimes it takes high-visibility people and circumstances for something to become part of the national agenda,"" says Marlow, whose group is working with the Harvard school of public health on domestic violence prevention. ""The 'Me Too' and 'Time's Up' movements didn't get elevated until celebrities said something, even though the other stories are no less important.""

When Fedders recently read a blog post Willoughby wrote last April, titled ""Why I Stayed,"" it was like she could have written parts about her own former life.

""Everyone loved him,"" Willoughby wrote. ""People commented all the time how lucky I was.""

People used to say that about Fedders' 6-foot-10 ex-husband, too, including that ""He just must be so wonderful to live with as he's extremely charming and smart,"" she says. After The Wall Street Journal wrote a story detailing the abuse and possible financial improprieties revealed in her divorce proceedings, Fedder says, ""I think he was very surprised that the rest of the country didn’t still feel that way.""

Fedders, 74, now lives in northern Virginia, where she still gets the same $400 a month in alimony, which is supplemented by Social Security and a small inheritance. She retired from her job as a nurse in 2016. Her ex-husband tried unsuccessfully to get a 25% share of the book profits. Charlotte Fedders used the money to help pay for their five sons' college education, to which John Fedders did not contribute.

""I don’t have a whole lot of money or too many of the things I used to have, but my life is great now,"" says Fedders, who sees her 10 grandchildren regularly.

John Fedders could not be reached for comment.

Only one of the now-grown children has any contact with their father, Fedders says. Visitation stopped 28 years ago after Andrew, then 12, told his father, ""Take me home. Violence is not the answer,"" after he was shoved against a wall for misbehaving in an elevator.

That's just as well, she said.

""They are all wonderful men who treat their wives like princesses,"" Fedders says. ""They never raise their hands or their voices.""

When he reposted a video of the Facebook Live Fedders did with USA TODAY last week, her oldest son, Luke, commented, ""You CAN be a man from an abused household and NOT continue the violence. Five of us can attest to that, thanks to how we were raised by a strong woman/mother.""",www.usatoday.com,center,6hv8lQzeFYP44fw4

In a collision of celebrity tabloid stars and criminal justice that could only happen in the Big Apple , supermodel Gigi Hadid strolled into a Manhattan courtroom Monday to be considered as a juror in the sex-assault case of fallen film mogul Harvey Weinstein .
The famous cat-walker , wearing an oversize men ’ s blazer over a white shirt , sauntered into the jury pool with 119 other prospective citizens of Manhattan on the fifth day of jury selection .
Justice James Burke asked her and the other potential jurors , “ Anyone believe you know me , the defendant or anyone of the lawyers ? ”
After the judge called on her , she stood up in the jury box and identified herself as Jelena Hadid , her real first name .
With Weinstein looking on from the defense table , Burke asked the supermodel , “ Do you think you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case ? ”
“ Yes , ” replied Hadid , who was recently spotted out in New York with ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik , formerly of One Direction fame .
The judge then read a list of more than 80 names of potential witnesses and people who may be referenced during testimony , including actresses Salma Hayek , Charlize Theron and Rosie Perez and Ryan Beatty .
“ I have met Salma Hayek and possibly Ryan Beatty , ” she said .
The judge questioned whether there was anything about having met them that would interfere with her ability to be fair in the case .
“ I think I ’ m still able to keep an open mind on the facts , ” Hadid replied soberly .
After dozens of jurors were dismissed , Hadid remained behind to fill out a questionnaire .

Justice James Burke asked her and the other potential jurors, “Anyone believe you know me, the defendant or anyone of the lawyers?”

Hadid raised her hand.

After the judge called on her, she stood up in the jury box and identified herself as Jelena Hadid, her real first name.

“I have met the defendant,” she said.

With Weinstein looking on from the defense table, Burke asked the supermodel, “Do you think you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case?”

“Yes,” replied Hadid, who was recently spotted out in New York with ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction fame.

The judge then read a list of more than 80 names of potential witnesses and people who may be referenced during testimony, including actresses Salma Hayek, Charlize Theron and Rosie Perez and Ryan Beatty.

He asked the prospective panelists whether anyone knows them.

Hadid again raised her hand.

“I have met Salma Hayek and possibly Ryan Beatty,” she said.

The judge questioned whether there was anything about having met them that would interfere with her ability to be fair in the case.

“I think I’m still able to keep an open mind on the facts,” Hadid replied soberly.

After dozens of jurors were dismissed, Hadid remained behind to fill out a questionnaire.

She was ordered to return next week to join other pre-screened panelists, from which 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected.

But before letting the potential pool go, the judge addressed the fact that two prospective jurors were previously caught discussing the case on social media.

One of them was someone who tweeted that he was eager to secure a seat on the panel to promote his novel.

The offenders “may be held in contempt of court and are subject and face serious consequences up to and including 30 days in jail and a significant fine, so don’t do that,’’ Burke warned the prospective pool Monday.

At least some of the potential jurors chuckled.

Weinstein is charged with two counts of predatory sex assault, two counts of rape and one count of criminal sex act stemming from the allegations of three women.

Openings in the trial are slated to begin Jan. 22.

Joe Biden . Biden , through a spokesperson , has denied the allegations . Reade has claimed to various media outlets , including ███ , that she told her mother , a close friend , and her brother about both the harassment and , to varying degrees of detail , the assault at the time . Her brother , Collin Moulton , and her friend , who has asked to remain anonymous , both confirmed that they heard about the allegations from Reade at the time . Reade ’ s mother died in 2016 , but both her brother and friend also confirmed Reade had told her mother , and that her mother , a longtime feminist and activist , urged her to go to the police . In interviews with ███ , Reade also mentioned that her mother had made a phone call to “ Larry King Live ” on CNN , during which she made reference to her daughter ’ s experience on Capitol Hill . Reade told ███ that her mother called in asking for advice after Reade , then in her 20s , left Biden ’ s office . “ I remember it being an anonymous call and her saying my daughter was sexually harassed and retaliated against and fired , where can she go for help ? I was mortified , ” Reade told me . Reade couldn ’ t remember the date or the year of the phone call , and King didn ’ t include the names of callers on his show . I was unable to find the call , but mentioned it in an interview with Katie Halper , the podcast host who first aired Reade ’ s allegation . After the podcast aired , a listener managed to find the call and sent it to ███ .

Congressional records list August 1993 as Reade ’ s last month of employment with Biden ’ s Senate office , and , according to property records , Reade ’ s mother , Jeanette Altimus , was living in San Luis Obispo County . Here is the transcript of the beginning of the call : KING : San Luis Obispo , California , hello . CALLER : Yes , hello . I ’ m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington ? My daughter has just left there , after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . KING : In other words , she had a story to tell but , out of respect for the person she worked for , she didn ’ t tell it ? CALLER : That ’ s true . King ’ s panel of guests offered no suggestions , and instead the conversation veered into a discussion of whether any of the men on set would leak damaging personal information about a rival to the press .
Reade , after being read the transcript of the call , said that it gelled with her memory of it , and , after the video was surfaced , confirmed it is her mother ’ s voice on the call . “ Aww , I have not heard my mom ’ s voice in awhile , ” she said . There are several notable things about the emergence of the call . On the one hand , the caller does not specifically mention “ sexual harassment ” or retaliation , as Reade had recalled . On the other hand , the reference to being unable to “ get through with her problems ” aligns with Reade ’ s claim that she complained to superiors in Biden ’ s office and got nowhere , and the reference to going to the press makes clear that the caller is talking about more than just generic problems at the office . The problems , she makes clear , would damage the senator if exposed . Reade ’ s inability to remember the exact date of the alleged assault , or its precise location , or the precise location of the office where she picked up the form needed to file a complaint , has been used by skeptics to suggest the allegation is fabricated . What the emergence of the call shows is that even if Reade ’ s memory is off on timing or details , the substance of her claims — in this case , that her mother called Larry King and discussed her situation — can still be true .
The call also calls into question the credibility of Biden ’ s denial . Reade said that she filed a complaint about Biden ’ s harassment with Marianne Baker , effectively the office manager in the Biden office . The Biden campaign released a statement from Baker , which said that neither Reade nor any other employee had ever complained about improper behavior . “ In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period — not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone , ” Baker said in the campaign ’ s statement . “ These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades. ” For Baker ’ s statement to be true , Reade would have had to have lied to her friend , brother , and mother about having complained to Biden ’ s office . There is no obvious reason Reade would make up a story to those closest to her about the Senate office not taking Biden ’ s harassment seriously , while at the same time resisting pressure to go to the press . Reade has said that the complaint she filed was related to the harassment she said she faced , and did not address the assault . The complaint was left with Biden ’ s office , and if it still exists , is with Biden ’ s papers at the University of Delaware .

Ruth George was walking alone to her car in a parking garage at the University of Illinois at Chicago early Saturday when a man began following and catcalling her. As many women do, the 19-year-old honor roll student ignored him. But that's when the situation turned deadly. Prosecutors said the man, Donald Thurman, got angry that he was being ignored and followed George to her car, came up from behind, and put her in a chokehold. He then allegedly threw her in the backseat of her car while she was unconscious and sexually assaulted her.

UIC Police Donald Thurman

Thurman was arrested on Sunday and charged with first-degree murder and aggravated sexual assault. The 26-year-old was released last December after serving two years of a six-year prison sentence for armed robbery, UIC police said. A judge ordered Thurman to be held without bail on Tuesday. During the hearing, Cook County prosecutors described the chilling circumstances that led to George’s death. Thurman, who saw George walking to the UIC parking garage at around 1:25 a.m. on Saturday, “thought she was pretty” and tried talking to her, prosecutors said in court documents provided to BuzzFeed News. While ignoring Thurman's catcalls and efforts to talk to her, George walked to her car, which is when she was allegedly put in a chokehold. With his arms still around George’s neck, Thurman allegedly dragged her from the ground and threw her in the backseat. She was unconscious, when Thurman raped her, prosecutors said. When George’s sisters and UIC police found her body, she was cold and unresponsive. Her sisters tried to resuscitate her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities also recovered a condom and semen in the car. Surveillance camera footage showed Thurman, wearing a “distinguishable white jacket,” following George into the parking garage and running away from it 35 minutes later, authorities said. On Sunday, Thurman was spotted in the area and arrested. He admitted to choking George, throwing her in the car, and sexually assaulting her when she was unconscious, but “denied having sexual intercourse with her,” prosecutors said.",www.buzzfeednews.com,left,HqdwP5MlJ5I7NHT0

In particular , Bloomberg has been challenged about allegations of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace , and has been questioned about a number of lawsuits filed against him and his eponymous company regarding those issues . On Saturday , a new investigative report from the Washington Post ’ s Michael Kranish once again surfaced those concerns .
Drawing from previously unreleased court documents , depositions , and interviews with witnesses , Kranish ’ s reporting details vulgar and misogynistic comments Bloomberg allegedly made toward women . The report also features a former employee who says he heard one of the most notorious accusations against Bloomberg himself — that the former mayor once told a pregnant subordinate to “ kill ” her unborn child ( Bloomberg has denied saying this ) .
And in a week in which Bloomberg was accused of being racist due to resurfaced comments about the stop-and-frisk program he once championed , Kranish ’ s work also highlights comments Bloomberg allegedly made that are startlingly degrading to African Americans ; one lawsuit claims Bloomberg once advised an employee to find “ some black who doesn ’ t have to speak English ” to work as a nanny for her .
Most of the accusations are from decades ago , when Bloomberg worked at the financial information services company he founded and that made him a billionaire . But they ’ ve become newly relevant as he has begun to surge in national polls and emerged as a real contender for the nomination — particularly if he performs well on Super Tuesday , when a third of the primary ’ s national delegates will be up for grabs across 16 contests .
The allegations contained in the Post ’ s reporting — many of which Bloomberg has denied — are likely to join a list of concerns that have been raised by both his progressive rivals and some Democratic voters about his personal and political history . These critics claim his past stances on stop-and-frisk , his unprecedented use of wealth to buy name recognition , and the allegations he faces about his treatment of women mean that he is fundamentally out of touch with the Democratic Party .
These allegations could also intensify calls for Bloomberg to release former employees from nondisclosure agreements made regarding the lawsuits , something Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for in December .
Whether these concerns are shared by the moderate voters whom Bloomberg is targeting with his campaign is an open question , however .
Bloomberg has been accused of some shocking behavior toward women
Much of what the Post lays out in its investigation of Bloomberg ’ s inappropriate conduct has been reported on before , but there are some critical new details .
Sekiko Sakai Garrison , a top salesperson who worked for Bloomberg in his business information firm , sued him and his company in the ’ 90s for workplace discrimination . The Post published some of the details of the complaints mentioned in the lawsuits :
On April 11 , 1995 at approximately 11:20 a.m. , Bloomberg was having a photograph taken with two female Company salespeople and a group of N.Y.U . Business School students , in the company snack area . When Bloomberg noticed Garrison standing nearby , he asked , “ Why didn ’ t they ask you to be in the picture ? I guess they saw your face. ” Continuing his penchant for ridiculing recently married women in his employ , Bloomberg asked plaintiff , “ How ’ s married life ? You married ? ” Plaintiff responded that her marriage was great and was going to get better in a few months : that she was pregnant , and the baby was due the following September . He responded to her “ Kill it ! ” Plaintiff asked Bloomberg to repeat himself , and again he said , “ Kill it ! ” and muttered , “ Great ! Number 16 ! ” suggesting to plaintiff his unhappiness that sixteen women in the Company had maternity-related status . Then he walked away .
Bloomberg has denied under oath the accusations that he told her to “ kill ” the unborn child , and he reached a confidential settlement with Garrison .
But the Post interviewed a former Bloomberg employee , David Zielenziger , who said that he witnessed the conversation . Zielenziger not only confirmed that he heard it , he said it was typical . “ He talked kind of crudely about women all the time , ” he told the Post .
The Post also obtained and published a notorious booklet compiled by a Bloomberg employee that contained some of his most degrading and profane alleged comments around the workplace . Titled “ The Wit and Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg , ” the 32-page booklet contains crude boasts and jokes , such as the claim that his famous computer system “ will do everything , including give you [ oral sex ] . I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business . ”
In 2001 , a Bloomberg spokesperson admitted that the booklet contained “ some of the things he might have said ” and Bloomberg has apologized to people offended by the booklet . But what ’ s striking is that Bloomberg ’ s campaign today takes the stance that he never said anything in that booklet . “ Mike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift , ” Bloomberg spokesperson Stu Loeser told the Post .
Loeser also added a general blanket statement about Bloomberg ’ s past remarks that have stirred controversy : “ Mike openly admits that his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life and some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. ” It ’ s worth noting the lack of specificity of the statement given the number of accusations made against Bloomberg , and the fact that it is not an apology for his past behavior .
The Bloomberg campaign did not respond to a request for comment from ███ .
In a Saturday tweet that seemed to address the Post article , however , Bloomberg wrote , “ I would not be where I am today without the talented women around me . I ’ ve depended on their leadership , their advice and their contributions . As I ’ ve demonstrated throughout my career , I will always be a champion for women in the workplace . ”
Garrison ’ s complaint also reportedly contains some allegations Bloomberg made racist remarks while at the office , including the remark about finding “ some black ” to serve as a nanny , and that the former mayor referred to Mexican clients as “ jumping beans . ”
Bloomberg ’ s behavior toward women is only one of many fronts on which he ’ s facing questions over whether it ’ s appropriate for him to seek the Democratic nomination .
He has also , as the New York Times ’ s Alexander Burns , Nicholas Kulish , Lazaro Gamio , and Karl Russell have reported , faced questions about the appropriateness of his charitable and political contributions , and the influence those gifts have given him . Those reporters noted : Bloomberg ’ s “ political and philanthropic spending has also secured the allegiance or cooperation of powerful institutions and leaders within the Democratic Party who might take issue with parts of his record were they not so reliant on his largess . ”
And in recent days , the candidate has had to defend himself against allegations that he is racist following a progressive podcaster resurfacing a 2015 speech . Bloomberg gave the speech defending New York ’ s stop-and-frisk program ( which was declared unconstitutional in 2013 ) , in which he said , “ Ninety-five percent of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O . You can just take the description , Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops . They are male , minorities , 16 to 25 . ”
A clip of that speech went viral and led to # BloombergIsRacist trending for much of the day Tuesday .
Bloomberg has apologized for supporting the program in recent months , and did so again Thursday , saying , “ I defended it , looking back , for too long because I didn ’ t understand then the unintended pain it was causing to young black and brown families and their kids . ... I apologize . ”
The effectiveness of these apologies — and what , if any , damage to Bloomberg ’ s campaign these controversies are inflicting — remains to be seen .
For now , Bloomberg remains strikingly popular among black voters ; a recent Quinnipiac poll , for instance , found he is the second most popular candidate among that demographic group , behind only former Vice President Joe Biden . And he has won the endorsements of a number of prominent black women politicians , including Rep. Lucy McBath , San Francisco Mayor London Breed , and Washington , DC , Mayor Muriel Bowser .
Many of the concerns about the former mayor appear to come from progressive candidates ( like Warren ’ s call for Bloomberg to release those bound by NDAs ) and their surrogates ( like Sanders surrogate Shaun King ’ s critiques of Bloomberg on race , sex , and religion ) . It is not clear that moderate voters share these concerns — particularly given Bloomberg ’ s poll numbers — meaning the candidate ’ s moment of truth is likely to come on Super Tuesday .","As presidential candidate and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has risen in Democratic primary polls — he’s currently in third place nationally according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average — he’s faced increasing scrutiny about his past.

Bloomberg faces increasing scrutiny on many fronts

Bloomberg’s behavior toward women is only one of many fronts on which he’s facing questions over whether it’s appropriate for him to seek the Democratic nomination.

He has also, as the New York Times’s Alexander Burns, Nicholas Kulish, Lazaro Gamio, and Karl Russell have reported, faced questions about the appropriateness of his charitable and political contributions, and the influence those gifts have given him.

You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25.”

A clip of that speech went viral and led to #BloombergIsRacist trending for much of the day Tuesday.

sexual_misconduct,Business Insider,1,https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4,Former neighbor of Joe Biden accuser Tara Reade corroborates sexual-assault account,2020-04-27,Rich Mchugh,"Tara Reade , a former staffer in Joe Biden 's Senate office , has accused the Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her in a congressional hallway in 1993 .
Now Reade 's former neighbor Lynda LaCasse , a Biden supporter , tells Insider that Reade told her about the alleged assault in detail in 1995 or 1996 : `` This happened , and I know it did because I remember talking about it . ''
A former colleague of Reade 's also told Insider that Reade talked in the mid-1990s of being sexually harassed by her former boss in Washington , DC .
The women have come forward just days after video emerged of a woman that Reade says is her mother calling into CNN 's Larry King Live in 1993 to talk about her daughter 's `` problems '' with a prominent senator .
Biden has not addressed the accusations , but a campaign spokesperson says they are false .
Insider is making this exclusive story available for free to non-subscribers . To read our full interview with LaCasse about Reade 's allegations — and to support our journalism — please click here and subscribe .
In March , when a former aide to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused the candidate of sexually assaulting her in 1993 , two people came forward to say that the woman , Tara Reade , had told them of the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred — her brother , Collin Moulton , and a friend who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution .
Now two more sources have come forward to corroborate certain details about Reade 's claims . One of them — a former neighbor of Reade 's — has told Insider for the first time , on the record , that Reade disclosed details about the alleged assault to her in the mid-1990s .
`` This happened , and I know it did because I remember talking about it , '' Lynda LaCasse , who lived next door to Reade in the mid-'90s , told Insider .
The other source , Lorraine Sanchez , who worked with Reade in the office of a California state senator in the mid-'90s , told Insider that she recalls Reade complaining at the time that her former boss in Washington , DC , had sexually harassed her , and that she had been fired after raising concerns .
In interviews with Insider , The New York Times , The Washington Post , and the politics podcaster Katie Halper — who broke the story of the assault allegations — Reade has said that in the spring or summer of 1993 , she was told to meet Biden in a semiprivate corridor to deliver a duffel bag . There , she said , Biden pushed her up against a wall , reached under her skirt , and penetrated her with his fingers . When she resisted his advances , Reade said , Biden expressed annoyance and said , `` Aw man , I heard you liked me . '' Then , she said , he pointed a finger at her and said , `` You 're nothing to me . '' After that , she said , he shook her by the shoulders and said , `` You 're OK , you 're fine , '' before walking away .
Before the alleged assault , Reade said , she had already complained to her superiors in Biden 's office that the way Biden looked at her and touched her made her uncomfortable . She got no response , she said , and after the alleged assault was abruptly relieved of her duties managing interns . She said she later filed a complaint about her treatment — but not the about the assault allegation — with a Senate human-resources office .
The Biden camp has denied Reade 's allegations . `` Women have a right to tell their story , and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims , '' Kate Bedingfield , Biden 's communications director said in a statement earlier this month . `` We encourage them to do so , because these accusations are false . ''
Asked to comment specifically on LaCasse 's and Sanchez 's comments , Bedingfield referred Insider to her previous statement . She did not respond to a request to interview Biden about Reade 's accusations .
Insider sought access to Biden 's senatorial papers , which are housed at the University of Delaware , to search for records that may shed light on Reade 's claims . The university denied the request , saying Biden 's papers `` will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life . ''
LaCasse told Insider that in 1995 or 1996 , Reade told her she had been assaulted by Biden . `` I remember her saying , here was this person that she was working for and she idolized him , '' LaCasse said . `` And he kind of put her up against a wall . And he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her . She felt like she was assaulted , and she really did n't feel there was anything she could do . ''
LaCasse said that she remembers Reade getting emotional as she told the story . `` She was crying , '' she said . `` She was upset . And the more she talked about it , the more she started crying . I remember saying that she needed to file a police report . '' LaCasse said she does not recall whether Reade supplied any other details , like the location of the alleged assault or anything Biden may have said .
`` I do n't remember all the details , '' LaCasse said . `` I remember the skirt . I remember the fingers . I remember she was devastated . ''
LaCasse is the first person to independently corroborate , in detail and on the record , that Reade had told others about her assault allegations contemporaneously . Reade 's brother Collin Moulton previously told Insider that he recalled his sister saying that Biden `` had his hand under her clothes at some point . ''
In a series of interviews with Insider over the past week , LaCasse said she decided to speak up now , at a time when Reade 's story is under intense scrutiny in the media and facing denials from the Biden campaign , because she believed Reade 's account when she first heard it .
`` I have to support her just because that 's what happened , '' LaCasse said . `` We need to stand up and tell the truth . ''

'It takes a lot of guts to do what she 's doing '
LaCasse , 60 , is a retired former medical staff coordinator and emergency-room clerk for San Luis Obispo General Hospital . She lived next door to Reade in 1995 and 1996 in an apartment complex near the beach in Morro Bay , California , a seaside community between Santa Barbara and Monterey . She told Insider that she and Reade shared a bond because they were both mothers , and their young daughters swam together in the apartment complex 's indoor pool .
LaCasse said she would sometimes sit on her front stoop to smoke cigarettes after putting her daughter to bed , and that Reade would occasionally join her . It was during one of these evening conversations , she said , that Reade told her about the alleged assault . `` We were talking about violent stories , '' LaCasse said , `` because I had a violent situation . We just started talking about things and she just told me about the senator that she had worked for and he put his hand up her skirt . ''
LaCasse acknowledged that coming forward to support an allegation against the Democratic presidential nominee `` may have repercussions for me . '' But she said she has no political ax to grind and intends to vote for Biden .
`` I personally am a Democrat , a very strong Democrat , '' she said . `` And I 'm for Biden , regardless . But still I have to come out and say this . ''
Insider has verified , through publicly available records , that Reade and LaCasse were neighbors at a Morro Bay apartment complex in 1995 . A review of LaCasse 's social-media presence shows a long history of anti-Trump sentiments . She has written approvingly of both Biden and his Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Twitter . In March , she shared a link on Facebook to a story detailing Reade 's allegations , with the message , `` This is my good friend Tara Reade , who was assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993 . ''
LaCasse told Insider that she and Reade fell out of touch after Reade moved out of their apartment complex in the late '90s . But the two reconnected in 2016 , she said , when Reade reached out to her on Facebook .
In April 2019 , Reade told a Nevada City , California , newspaper that Biden had inappropriately touched her and made her uncomfortable , though she did not accuse him of assaulting her .
It was after that story , LaCasse said , that she and Reade first revisited the conversation they 'd had about Biden in the mid-'90s . `` She mentioned that she had come forward , '' LaCasse said , `` and so I said , 'Oh my gosh . Yeah . I do remember that . ' ''
Then late last month , in a podcast interview with Halper , Reade made her full accusation known — that Biden had attacked her in a corridor , shoved his hand up her skirt , and digitally penetrated her .
After seeing how political operatives and news organizations responded to the claim — the Biden camp denied it outright , and critics scoured Reade 's social-media accounts for evidence of a purported affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin — LaCasse said she decided to come forward .
`` She did n't ask me to , '' LaCasse said . `` I volunteered to do that just recently . If this was me , I would want somebody to stand up for me . It takes a lot of guts to do what she 's doing . ''
Reade told a former colleague she had been fired for voicing concerns
Yet another source reached by Insider corroborates some of Reade 's claims about her time working for Biden .
After she left Washington , DC , Reade worked for California state Sen. Jack O'Connell . Lorraine Sanchez , a former legislative staffer in O'Connell 's office , mentored Reade and worked alongside her from 1994 through 1996 . Sanchez told Insider that Reade complained at the time about being mistreated by her former employer .
`` [ Reade said ] she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC , '' Sanchez said , `` and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors , she was let go , fired . ''
Sanchez said she does not recall if Reade offered details about the sort of harassment she allegedly suffered , or if she named Biden . `` What I do remember , '' Sanchez said , `` is reassuring her that nothing like that would ever happen to her here in our office , that she was in a safe place , free from any sexual harassment . '' Reade said she never experienced harassment from any other employer she had during her time in Washington , and that the employer Sanchez recalls her complaining about was Biden .
Sanchez praised Reade for speaking out . `` It takes great courage and strength to come forward , '' Sanchez said in a statement to Insider . `` It 's much easier to keep silent . However , I also understand the duty we have as women to share our story regardless of who the perpetrator may be . ''
Reade went on to work in the domestic-violence unit for the King County prosecutor in Seattle , and she received her law degree from Seattle University School of Law in 2004 . She later served as a legal-services director for the Snohomish County Center for Battered Women .
Last week , video emerged of an unnamed woman that Reade says is her mother calling into a 1993 broadcast of CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' devoted to the culture of Washington , DC . The woman claimed that her daughter had run into unspecified `` problems '' with a US senator .
`` I 'm wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington , '' the caller said . `` My daughter has just left there , after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . ''
Reade had previously told The Intercept 's Ryan Grim that her mother , who died in 2016 , had made such a call , but could n't recall the date . When Grim mentioned it on a podcast , Twitter users dug up the transcript and video .
Reade , who has listened to the newly unearthed phone call , told Insider that it was indeed her mother 's voice speaking to King . `` It was almost a spiritual experience , because my mom loved me so much and supported me , '' Reade said , choking back tears . `` I get emotional even now , and I gave her such a hard time about [ calling ] Larry King 's show that I feel really bad that I could n't say to her now , 'Thank you so much , ' and give her a hug . And I think the most powerful part for me was just how she crossed space and time to help me . ''
In addition to the denial from Biden 's campaign , other former Senate staffers have emerged to cast doubt on Reade 's accusations .
Marianne Baker , who was Biden 's executive assistant for almost two decades , including in 1993 , issued a statement saying she never witnessed or heard of any inappropriate conduct : `` I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade 's accounting of events , which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional , and as a manager . ''
Insider has reached out to other staffers who worked in Biden 's office during the time Reade worked there . Melissa Lefko , at the time a staff assistant , said she does n't remember Reade at all , and that she would have been aware of any accusations of assault or harassment at the time . `` Had there been anything , I would have heard about it , '' she said .
An intern who worked under Reade , and who asked to remain anonymous , said she does not recall Reade discussing any allegations of assault or harassment . But she does corroborate Reade 's claim that she was abruptly relieved of her duties as intern supervisor in April 1993 , a move that the former intern found odd at the time .
Earlier this month , Reade filed a report with the DC Metropolitan Police department memorializing her allegations about the 1993 incident . Even though the statute of limitations rendered a full investigation highly unlikely , she took the step , she told Insider at the time , for `` safety reasons '' because she had faced online harassment . `` I also wanted to make it clear that I would be willing to go under oath or cooperate with any law enforcement regarding it , because it did happen , '' she said . `` Even if it was 26 years ago . ''
On April 20 , a police spokesperson told Insider that there was `` an active investigation '' into Reade 's complaint . But in a statement on Saturday , the department said the case had been `` moved to an inactive status . '' Reade said she expected that outcome , and said she is not backing down .
`` I 'd like to be heard in a fair and objective way , '' she said . `` And I 'd also like to hear Joe Biden 's response , which has not happened . My hope is that the conversation will move forward and we will examine how I was treated when I came forward , and really look at the fact that , like domestic violence , sexual assault , and sexual harassment is not a partisan issue . It is an equal-opportunity offender . ''","Tara Reade, a former staffer in Joe Biden's Senate office, has accused the Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her in a congressional hallway in 1993.

Now Reade's former neighbor Lynda LaCasse, a Biden supporter, tells Insider that Reade told her about the alleged assault in detail in 1995 or 1996: ""This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it.""

A former colleague of Reade's also told Insider that Reade talked in the mid-1990s of being sexually harassed by her former boss in Washington, DC.

The women have come forward just days after video emerged of a woman that Reade says is her mother calling into CNN's Larry King Live in 1993 to talk about her daughter's ""problems"" with a prominent senator.

Biden has not addressed the accusations, but a campaign spokesperson says they are false.

In March, when a former aide to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused the candidate of sexually assaulting her in 1993, two people came forward to say that the woman, Tara Reade, had told them of the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred — her brother, Collin Moulton, and a friend who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

Now two more sources have come forward to corroborate certain details about Reade's claims. One of them — a former neighbor of Reade's — has told Insider for the first time, on the record, that Reade disclosed details about the alleged assault to her in the mid-1990s.

""This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,"" Lynda LaCasse, who lived next door to Reade in the mid-'90s, told Insider.

The other source, Lorraine Sanchez, who worked with Reade in the office of a California state senator in the mid-'90s, told Insider that she recalls Reade complaining at the time that her former boss in Washington, DC, had sexually harassed her, and that she had been fired after raising concerns.

In interviews with Insider, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the politics podcaster Katie Halper — who broke the story of the assault allegations — Reade has said that in the spring or summer of 1993, she was told to meet Biden in a semiprivate corridor to deliver a duffel bag. There, she said, Biden pushed her up against a wall, reached under her skirt, and penetrated her with his fingers. When she resisted his advances, Reade said, Biden expressed annoyance and said, ""Aw man, I heard you liked me."" Then, she said, he pointed a finger at her and said, ""You're nothing to me."" After that, she said, he shook her by the shoulders and said, ""You're OK, you're fine,"" before walking away.

Before the alleged assault, Reade said, she had already complained to her superiors in Biden's office that the way Biden looked at her and touched her made her uncomfortable. She got no response, she said, and after the alleged assault was abruptly relieved of her duties managing interns. She said she later filed a complaint about her treatment — but not the about the assault allegation — with a Senate human-resources office.

The Biden camp has denied Reade's allegations. ""Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's communications director said in a statement earlier this month. ""We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.""

Asked to comment specifically on LaCasse's and Sanchez's comments, Bedingfield referred Insider to her previous statement. She did not respond to a request to interview Biden about Reade's accusations.

Insider sought access to Biden's senatorial papers, which are housed at the University of Delaware, to search for records that may shed light on Reade's claims. The university denied the request, saying Biden's papers ""will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life.""

'I remember she was devastated'

LaCasse told Insider that in 1995 or 1996, Reade told her she had been assaulted by Biden. ""I remember her saying, here was this person that she was working for and she idolized him,"" LaCasse said. ""And he kind of put her up against a wall. And he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her. She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn't feel there was anything she could do.""

LaCasse said that she remembers Reade getting emotional as she told the story. ""She was crying,"" she said. ""She was upset. And the more she talked about it, the more she started crying. I remember saying that she needed to file a police report."" LaCasse said she does not recall whether Reade supplied any other details, like the location of the alleged assault or anything Biden may have said.

""I don't remember all the details,"" LaCasse said. ""I remember the skirt. I remember the fingers. I remember she was devastated.""

LaCasse is the first person to independently corroborate, in detail and on the record, that Reade had told others about her assault allegations contemporaneously. Reade's brother Collin Moulton previously told Insider that he recalled his sister saying that Biden ""had his hand under her clothes at some point.""

In a series of interviews with Insider over the past week, LaCasse said she decided to speak up now, at a time when Reade's story is under intense scrutiny in the media and facing denials from the Biden campaign, because she believed Reade's account when she first heard it.

""I have to support her just because that's what happened,"" LaCasse said. ""We need to stand up and tell the truth.""

'It takes a lot of guts to do what she's doing'

LaCasse, 60, is a retired former medical staff coordinator and emergency-room clerk for San Luis Obispo General Hospital. She lived next door to Reade in 1995 and 1996 in an apartment complex near the beach in Morro Bay, California, a seaside community between Santa Barbara and Monterey. She told Insider that she and Reade shared a bond because they were both mothers, and their young daughters swam together in the apartment complex's indoor pool.

LaCasse said she would sometimes sit on her front stoop to smoke cigarettes after putting her daughter to bed, and that Reade would occasionally join her. It was during one of these evening conversations, she said, that Reade told her about the alleged assault. ""We were talking about violent stories,"" LaCasse said, ""because I had a violent situation. We just started talking about things and she just told me about the senator that she had worked for and he put his hand up her skirt.""

LaCasse acknowledged that coming forward to support an allegation against the Democratic presidential nominee ""may have repercussions for me."" But she said she has no political ax to grind and intends to vote for Biden.

""I personally am a Democrat, a very strong Democrat,"" she said. ""And I'm for Biden, regardless. But still I have to come out and say this.""

Insider has verified, through publicly available records, that Reade and LaCasse were neighbors at a Morro Bay apartment complex in 1995. A review of LaCasse's social-media presence shows a long history of anti-Trump sentiments. She has written approvingly of both Biden and his Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Twitter. In March, she shared a link on Facebook to a story detailing Reade's allegations, with the message, ""This is my good friend Tara Reade, who was assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993.""

LaCasse told Insider that she and Reade fell out of touch after Reade moved out of their apartment complex in the late '90s. But the two reconnected in 2016, she said, when Reade reached out to her on Facebook.

In April 2019, Reade told a Nevada City, California, newspaper that Biden had inappropriately touched her and made her uncomfortable, though she did not accuse him of assaulting her.

It was after that story, LaCasse said, that she and Reade first revisited the conversation they'd had about Biden in the mid-'90s. ""She mentioned that she had come forward,"" LaCasse said, ""and so I said, 'Oh my gosh. Yeah. I do remember that.'""

Then late last month, in a podcast interview with Halper, Reade made her full accusation known — that Biden had attacked her in a corridor, shoved his hand up her skirt, and digitally penetrated her.

After seeing how political operatives and news organizations responded to the claim — the Biden camp denied it outright, and critics scoured Reade's social-media accounts for evidence of a purported affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin — LaCasse said she decided to come forward.

""She didn't ask me to,"" LaCasse said. ""I volunteered to do that just recently. If this was me, I would want somebody to stand up for me. It takes a lot of guts to do what she's doing.""

Former Biden staffer Tara Reade. Tara Reade

Reade told a former colleague she had been fired for voicing concerns

Yet another source reached by Insider corroborates some of Reade's claims about her time working for Biden.

After she left Washington, DC, Reade worked for California state Sen. Jack O'Connell. Lorraine Sanchez, a former legislative staffer in O'Connell's office, mentored Reade and worked alongside her from 1994 through 1996. Sanchez told Insider that Reade complained at the time about being mistreated by her former employer.

""[Reade said] she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC,"" Sanchez said, ""and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors, she was let go, fired.""

Sanchez said she does not recall if Reade offered details about the sort of harassment she allegedly suffered, or if she named Biden. ""What I do remember,"" Sanchez said, ""is reassuring her that nothing like that would ever happen to her here in our office, that she was in a safe place, free from any sexual harassment."" Reade said she never experienced harassment from any other employer she had during her time in Washington, and that the employer Sanchez recalls her complaining about was Biden.

Sanchez praised Reade for speaking out. ""It takes great courage and strength to come forward,"" Sanchez said in a statement to Insider. ""It's much easier to keep silent. However, I also understand the duty we have as women to share our story regardless of who the perpetrator may be.""

Reade went on to work in the domestic-violence unit for the King County prosecutor in Seattle, and she received her law degree from Seattle University School of Law in 2004. She later served as a legal-services director for the Snohomish County Center for Battered Women.

An anonymous 1993 call to 'Larry King Live'

Last week, video emerged of an unnamed woman that Reade says is her mother calling into a 1993 broadcast of CNN's ""Larry King Live"" devoted to the culture of Washington, DC. The woman claimed that her daughter had run into unspecified ""problems"" with a US senator.

""I'm wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington,"" the caller said. ""My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.""

Reade had previously told The Intercept's Ryan Grim that her mother, who died in 2016, had made such a call, but couldn't recall the date. When Grim mentioned it on a podcast, Twitter users dug up the transcript and video.

Reade, who has listened to the newly unearthed phone call, told Insider that it was indeed her mother's voice speaking to King. ""It was almost a spiritual experience, because my mom loved me so much and supported me,"" Reade said, choking back tears. ""I get emotional even now, and I gave her such a hard time about [calling] Larry King's show that I feel really bad that I couldn't say to her now, 'Thank you so much,' and give her a hug. And I think the most powerful part for me was just how she crossed space and time to help me.""

Some former coworkers cast doubt

In addition to the denial from Biden's campaign, other former Senate staffers have emerged to cast doubt on Reade's accusations.

Marianne Baker, who was Biden's executive assistant for almost two decades, including in 1993, issued a statement saying she never witnessed or heard of any inappropriate conduct: ""I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade's accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager.""

Insider has reached out to other staffers who worked in Biden's office during the time Reade worked there. Melissa Lefko, at the time a staff assistant, said she doesn't remember Reade at all, and that she would have been aware of any accusations of assault or harassment at the time. ""Had there been anything, I would have heard about it,"" she said.

An intern who worked under Reade, and who asked to remain anonymous, said she does not recall Reade discussing any allegations of assault or harassment. But she does corroborate Reade's claim that she was abruptly relieved of her duties as intern supervisor in April 1993, a move that the former intern found odd at the time.

A police investigation has been moved to 'inactive status'

Earlier this month, Reade filed a report with the DC Metropolitan Police department memorializing her allegations about the 1993 incident. Even though the statute of limitations rendered a full investigation highly unlikely, she took the step, she told Insider at the time, for ""safety reasons"" because she had faced online harassment. ""I also wanted to make it clear that I would be willing to go under oath or cooperate with any law enforcement regarding it, because it did happen,"" she said. ""Even if it was 26 years ago.""

On April 20, a police spokesperson told Insider that there was ""an active investigation"" into Reade's complaint. But in a statement on Saturday, the department said the case had been ""moved to an inactive status."" Reade said she expected that outcome, and said she is not backing down.

Opinion contributors

The problem of child pornography has reached crisis levels. In all corners of the internet, images of child sexual abuse are being created, produced, and traded. Last year, more than 45 million online images and videos of child sexual abuse material were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

The pain inflicted on these children is unimaginable. The details are sickening: an increasing number of the images are of infants and children younger than 12 enduring the most serious forms of sexual torture.

Tragically, the U.S. government’s work to stop the spread of this vile content and bring perpetrators to justice is falling short. It is imperative we address this problem, wherever it exists.

Vast network hides horrific crimes

Abusers go to just about any lengths to evade the law. They have built a vast online underworld to hide their crimes. It’s happening on a range of platforms and networks – including the government entity we most associate with security and protection: the Department of Defense.

In 2018, the Department of Defense's network was ranked 19th out of almost 3,000 nationwide networks in the amount of peer-to-peer child pornography sharing. The ranking is shocking. But it’s not entirely unexpected.

A 2006 investigation carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found that 5,000 individuals – including hundreds affiliated with the Department of Defense – subscribed to websites that contain child sexual abuse images and videos. Out of those 5,000 people, 80 percent of them were not investigated because the military lacked the resources needed to follow up on leads.

The tools and training the military currently uses are outdated and ineffective. They don’t meet the scope and scale of the problem at hand. Military investigators have requested and must have access to state of the art training and technical capabilities so they are better equipped to take action and put perpetrators exactly where they belong: behind bars.

Law will help military fight abuse

To address the gap in capacity, we introduced the END Network Abuse Act. The bipartisan and bicameral bill would give our military leaders the tools they need to get rid of child pornography on the Department of Defense’s network, go after offenders, and protect innocent and vulnerable children. And our colleagues have recognized the importance of this, by including a version of the bill in the final annual defense bill, which passed the Senate this week.

Once enacted, the law will upgrade the training and technical capacity of military criminal investigative organizations. It will direct the Department of Defense to coordinate on jurisdictional issues so cases are referred to the proper authorities. The department also will be required to enter into collaborative agreements with child protection organizations and trauma informed health care providers to ensure that kids who are victimized receive the services they need.

This is a nationwide issue. But for states like Alaska and Hawaii with both significant Department of Defense footprints and large indigenous populations, which have been shown to be disproportionately affected by child sexual exploitation, addressing these gaps is particularly important in stopping cycles of abuse.

A broad coalition of advocates – law enforcement, child protection services and public health organizations – back the measure. Even the Department of Defense expressed its full support for our bill.

This effort to protect our families gained support from both sides of the aisle. Conservatives, liberals – folks from red states and blue states – signaled with their votes Congress’ commitment to combating child exploitation.

Together, we will bring offenders to justice, and we will protect more children. There is no more sacred charge.

She Lost Custody of Their Kids,2020-07-08,,"Tara Coronado , a 45-year-old mother of four , sat in a nondescript Austin courtroom six years ago during a custody fight with her ex-husband , biting her tongue as the judge dressed her down .
“ There is a huge amount of anger coming from you , ” said Judge Susan Sheppard . “ You deny it and are obviously not recognizing how almost every piece of information you give the Court is tinged by , tainted by , influenced by your overwhelming anger and hurt . ”
Coronado was angry . A slender Mexican-American woman with long dark hair and a whip-quick mind , she ’ d scraped her way up from a New Mexico trailer park to serve in the Peace Corps and graduate from the University of Texas Law School . She married Ed Cunningham , a former football star turned lawyer and businessman , and had three boys and a girl . And she ’ d stayed home to raise them , for long stretches on her own , through a tumultuous 15-year-marriage that broke down when she discovered her husband had bought a second house across town where he was having an affair with another woman .
Outside their custody battle , Cunningham was facing a separate criminal charge of assaulting Coronado shortly before their divorce—allegations he adamantly denied . In a 2013 police report that included photographs of her injuries , Coronado told authorities that he ’ d punched her in the face , kneed her in the chest and dragged her by her hair across the road , resulting in a black eye , bruises and abrasions on her back and legs . Coronado obtained an emergency protection order , and Cunningham was arrested .
But a year later , in front of the court , it was Coronado under scrutiny . Cunningham ’ s attorney and a court-appointed therapist cast her as vindictive and unstable , fabricating abuse claims in retaliation for his infidelity ; insulting his new wife , Aimee Boone ; and poisoning their children against him .
By her own admission , amid their operatic , years-long separation and divorce , Coronado had sometimes acted badly . During fights , sometimes in front of the kids , she called Boone ugly names . In texts , she swung between castigating Cunningham for abandoning his family and begging him to call .
At one point during the trial , Cunningham ’ s attorney suggested she had “ a lot of unresolved issues and anger from the divorce. ” Coronado shot back , “ I have a lot of unresolved issues with putting up with 15 years of getting beaten to be left penniless and raising four children by myself . ”
But outbursts like that don ’ t play well in a family court system that women ’ s rights advocates say is permeated by gender bias . Judges and court-appointed experts are trying to seek the best interests of children in cases where polarized and combative parents present irreconcilable versions of reality . They point out that in the high-conflict cases they are drawn into , they ’ re often the target of fury from the parent who loses . Yet some also punish women who appear angry or aggressive ; fail to understand how trauma can warp emotions and personal demeanor ; and rely on forensic assessments that some experts consider misinformed at best and unethical at worst .
Sheppard approved Cunningham ’ s request for a psychological evaluation of Coronado . While her order covered both parents , Sheppard ’ s conclusion seemed clear as she told Coronado she hoped the evaluation might “ explain in some way how you have said and done things that reflect so badly on your judgment and on your parenting. ” The judge wondered aloud whether the evaluator might find an “ Axis II ” mental health condition , a category that includes severe diagnoses like borderline personality disorder .
As the custody case dragged through the courts , a parade of therapists—assigned by the court , but paid for by Cunningham—would weigh in , declaring that the problem wasn ’ t him , but Coronado , whom they described as manipulative , hostile and defensive . They labeled her with a range of diagnoses , from borderline personality disorder—an illness marked by unstable emotions and interpersonal relationships—to the contested theory of “ parental alienation ” —that is , deliberately estranging the children from their father and coercing them into supporting false claims of abuse .
Cunningham , who denies ever hitting Coronado , declined to speak on the record for this article , although he shared some documents from the case . “ Tara has a long history of making false allegations when she gets angry or does not get her way , ” he would tell a court-appointed psychologist . “ I have always avoided all physical contact with Tara ( i.e. , except to deflect her blows or to restrain her from hitting me ) because I know that she is always looking for a way to gain leverage through her crazy accusations . ”
The custody battle turned on how to interpret the same court transcripts and therapists ’ reports , which Cunningham ’ s camp saw as incontrovertible evidence of Coronado ’ s manipulativeness and instability , and hers read as reflecting profound gender disparities .
Roughly three months after the judge ’ s order , Cunningham was awarded primary custody of the three boys , and Coronado was relegated to four hours of supervised visitation per week . She met her sons in two-hour increments under the watchful eye of a supervisor she paid $ 100 an hour—a substantial chunk of the wages of her new administrative job . A year later , she lost custody of her daughter as well .
As Coronado would testify , it was the nightmare realization of threats she claimed her ex made when she ’ d first filed the police report . “ He said he ’ d take the kids away , take the money away , and tell everyone I was crazy , ” she said . “ And he ’ s done all that . ”
Conventional wisdom has it that women automatically have the upper hand in custody fights , and a mother claiming she ’ s been abused has a powerful case to sway the court . But when domestic violence charges are in play , advocates and researchers suggest , mothers are often at a disadvantage .
“ The legal system is set up on dealing with agreeableness , ” said Margaret Bassett , then the deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin Institute on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault , who would help during Coronado ’ s case . Family courts often favor the parent who will cooperate to maintain their ex ’ s relationship with their children .
This “ friendly parent ” principle , sensible overall , since it ’ s healthy for most children to maintain bonds with both parents , can become a blind spot—or worse—in cases of alleged abuse . Mothers who charge fathers with domestic violence amid custody battles are often suspected of fabricating the claims as a tactic to win control of their children . But battered women ’ s advocates suggest that many “ high-conflict ” divorces—the single-digit fraction of separations that are extensively litigated—are actually domestic violence cases in disguise .
Some research backs this up . One small 1992 study found that there was physical aggression between parents in 70 percent of high-conflict custody fights , and “ severe ” violence ( meaning battery or the threat or use of a weapon ) in nearly half . Another study , published in 1997 by the National Center for State Courts and covering several cities , found documented evidence of domestic violence in 20 to 55 percent of contested custody cases . In one city where court mediators screened for it , “ much higher ” rates of abuse were revealed .
Yet merely raising the issue tends to work against mothers . A 2004 study funded by the National Institute of Justice found that mothers were more likely to receive primary custody if they had not made allegations of domestic abuse , while fathers were equally likely to get custody whether there were allegations against them or not . The study also found that when mediators discovered evidence of violence when the mother hadn ’ t alleged any , they were more likely to recommend court protections like supervised child exchanges , meaning women who were open about being abused received less protection for themselves and their children than those who were not .
One explanation for the different fates of men and women in family court may be how domestic violence victims can come across : hyper-vigilant , agitated , guarded , volatile . These characteristics can make mothers look unstable or unfit , but are also commonplace reactions to trauma or even symptoms of PTSD .
Many family courts and therapists have not kept pace with a growing understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence , or lack the training to interpret the impact of trauma on abuse victims , domestic violence experts say . And many are swayed by traditional assumptions about men , women and anger .
“ An angry woman might be vengeful and fabricating , ” said Joan Meier , a George Washington University law school professor and founder of the advocacy organization DV LEAP , which handles appeals for battered women in custody disputes . “ But angry fathers ? We have no problem with that because of course he ’ s angry—he ’ s been kept from his children and there are these lies being promulgated about him . It ’ s so thick with gender stereotypes , you can cut it with a knife . ”
What it adds up to , said UT ’ s Bassett , is a fateful choice : “ If I ’ m going to court and alleging that my partner is abusive , I ’ m probably going to lose custody of the children . Do I go to court and risk that , or do I play the game the way it ’ s set up ? ”
The two met in 1997 , when Cunningham , a lawyer working as a sports agent , spoke to Coronado ’ s law school class . Cunningham , with his shock of side-swept brown hair and open smile , seemed larger than life . He was almost 6 ’ 8 and around 275 pounds , befitting his brief stint in the NFL and before that his status as an All America player for Austin ’ s storied UT Longhorns . He was in the middle of his first divorce , and their initial romance swept Coronado off her feet .
But within months , she said , the relationship turned violent . When she went with friends to a party at his house and saw him with another woman , their resulting argument culminated in a loud fight in his bathroom where , Coronado told police , Cunningham threw her against the sink and choked her . Upon seeing her bruises , her brother Sam , who lived with her at the time , called the police , and convinced his sister to speak with them . Her friend Sharon Rutman ( then Rubin ) , who ’ d been outside the bathroom door , gave a police statement as well , describing seeing Cunningham walk out , leaving Coronado splayed on the floor , legs braced against the wall and gasping for air .
While she debated pressing charges , Coronado learned she was pregnant . She reconciled with Cunningham and moved into his stone two-story home in Bee Cave , high in the Hill Country surrounding Austin . When she was six months pregnant , they married , and she settled into home life , having three more children within six years . Cunningham shifted from sports law to other business ventures , and they moved in influential circles . In 2001 , Cunningham launched a short-lived campaign for U.S. Senate . Coronado became an intensely involved stay-at-home mother , shepherding their children between sporting events at expensive private schools , coaching some of their teams .
Coronado says their early years were marked by volatility and sporadic violence , with frequent fights about money or Cunningham ’ s infidelity . She ’ d later tell numerous friends , as well as a court-appointed psychologist , that sometimes her husband hit , bit or spit on her , destroyed clothes and keepsakes , and that once when she was pregnant , held her on the ground and put a hose in her mouth , choking her with water . Cunningham told the same psychologist , “ nothing even remotely close to this is true . ”
In interviews with 10 of Coronado ’ s family members , friends or neighbors , people recalled troubling dynamics about the relationship . Multiple friends described her having bruises that she excused as injuries from sports or yard work , or that she ’ d wear long-sleeve shirts and pants through the Texas summer . She called her brother so frequently in distress , Sam said , that he ultimately became frustrated with her refusal to leave .
It baffled them . Coronado was smart , competitive , driven and , above all , tough . “ Because she ’ s such a force of nature , it ’ s harder to believe that she would stay in a relationship that ’ s violent , ” said Jeana Lungwitz , director of the University of Texas School of Law ’ s Domestic Violence Clinic , who helped on her case .
But that ’ s not how domestic violence plays out , experts say . Women stay in abusive relationships for many reasons—out of fear , dependence or terror that if they leave they or their children could be in greater danger . Another cause : the paradox of “ traumatic bonding ” that results from the abusive cycle of good and bad times .
In Coronado ’ s own calculus , the alleged episodes of violence came amid happy moments—when Cunningham dressed up as Santa Claus and transformed into what she called “ over-do it Ed ” —as well as long stretches where he was simply gone . ( He took a job in China and lived largely away from home for years . ) “ I justified it , ” she said . “ It ’ s not every day , we had a nice life . ”
But by the end of 2011 , she discovered that Cunningham had bought another house , where he began living part-time , sometimes , she said , during periods when he claimed he was abroad . She learned he was seeing Boone—an heiress to the Container Store fortune , a prominent Democratic donor who ’ s hosted fundraisers and events for politicians like Barack Obama and Joe Biden and who is now chair of the national board of directors of Planned Parenthood—and that the relationship was serious . ( Boone declined an interview request . ) Eventually , Cunningham filed for divorce .

Negotiations stalled amid the rancor . By late 2012 , an attorney appointed by the court to determine the children ’ s best interests tried to help the family work out a custody schedule , but removed herself soon after , saying the situation was beyond her control . The parents were so deadlocked , and the children so caught in between , that she believed some of the kids would soon refuse to visit their father . “ The pathology in this family , ” she wrote , “ is acute . ”
Then came the May 2013 fight . According to Coronado ’ s police statement , Cunningham had been staying with her for several days when an argument over money devolved into a shouting match about Boone . In her statement , Coronado said she grabbed Cunningham ’ s phone , threatening to call Boone , and he charged at her , knocking her to the ground , dropping his knee onto her chest and punching her in the face , before driving away . Cunningham told a court-appointed psychologist that Coronado routinely physically blocked him from leaving the house after visits , and that after stealing his phone she fell while running away ; any injuries she had , he suggested , must have resulted from that .
During the altercation , one of Coronado ’ s neighbors , Kishna Weaver , noticed her dog barking and turned on a light . A short time later , Weaver said in an interview , Coronado came over , looking like she ’ d been in a fight . Weaver drove her to the police station , and as soon as they arrived , she recalled , an officer in the parking lot saw them and had the same reaction Weaver did : immediately asking Coronado who ’ d hit her . Bill Pitmon , a lieutenant with the department who later took Coronado ’ s statement , recalled in an interview how “ visibly shaken up ” she still seemed nearly a week after the alleged attack . Later that month , Cunningham was arrested for assault family violence , a misdemeanor charge . Within weeks , their divorce settlement , including primary custody for Coronado and extended standard visitation rights for Cunningham , finally went through .
Despite how bad the marriage had been , Coronado was undone by its dissolution . Her friends remember her in the summer of 2013 being “ beside herself , ” at times almost catatonic , at other times acting erratically . She went to Cunningham ’ s second house to confront him , and once went inside and mocked Boone ’ s clothes and broke her makeup case . She insulted Boone to Cunningham , calling her his “ new meal ticket , ” once using an anti-Semitic slur . In texts submitted to the court as part of the custody battle , she swerved between picking fights and telling him his family needed him . Once , after one of the children told Cunningham that their mother seemed depressed and wasn ’ t getting out of bed , he came over to stock the house with food and watch the kids . At one point that summer , Coronado texted Cunningham to apologize for the protection order , and in October , she signed a non-prosecution form , noting that she was focusing on her kids and finding work .
But behind the scenes , Coronado charged , Cunningham had been pressuring her to withdraw her abuse complaint . After his arrest , she would testify , he had written that he couldn ’ t afford to make any more of their divorce settlement payments “ until I get through all this litigation you have initiated , ” which she believed was a reference to the criminal abuse case . Although Coronado was awarded the family home in the divorce , for months she said Cunningham failed to sign over the deed , and didn ’ t do so until after she ’ d signed the non-prosecution form . And in person , she ’ d also later testify , he threatened to “ ruin ” her if she helped the prosecution .
In February 2014 , Travis County Attorney Jordan Foster tried to convince her to cooperate with the prosecution . “ Right now , based on what I ’ m seeing , it looks to me like he hurt you and I will have to recommend a conviction , ” Foster wrote in an email . A few days later , Coronado agreed to speak with him . After word got back to Cunningham that Coronado would participate in the prosecution , she would later testify , his next settlement check bounced . Then , although she would tell the court he ’ d only exercised a handful of custodial weekends over their nearly two-year separation , right after he and Boone got married , he demanded to resume visitation . To Coronado , it seemed “ he was going through with the threats he ’ d made . ”
Cunningham ’ s version of events is different . He told a court-appointed psychologist that he ’ d tried to see the children more regularly , but Coronado had restricted him to visits at her house , and had limited even those as his marriage to Boone approached . He said Coronado had failed to arrange for the children to attend his wedding , and had later discouraged visitation , sometimes saying the children didn ’ t want anything to do with him and other times that they needed therapy first .
Coronado ’ s attorney at the time filed a custody-modification lawsuit to prevent the children ’ s visitation with their father until a therapist evaluated them and declared it in their best interests to resume visits . But the gambit backfired immediately , setting off years of litigation and the intervention of several therapists—first to evaluate the children , then Coronado and Cunningham themselves .
Starting in June of 2014 , the children began seeing two therapists the court appointed to facilitate their reunification with Cunningham : Dr. Susan McMillan , who treated the older siblings , and LeAnn Artis , who worked primarily with the younger two . ( Artis declined to comment for this article , and McMillan could not be reached for comment . )
Neither therapist observed Coronado directly with her children . But they came to believe that she was swaying the children against their father , and they relied heavily on parental alienation theory .
Artis later declared in court that Coronado ’ s behavior amounted to emotional abuse , and that the family was one of the most extreme cases of parental alienation she ’ d ever seen . As an example , Artis testified that the youngest boys had changed their stories , from saying they hadn ’ t witnessed Cunningham hitting their mother to claiming they had . And she felt Coronado was behind one child ’ s backing out of attending an event for President Obama hosted at the home Cunningham and Boone shared , now valued at $ 3.75 million .
After a few sessions with Coronado , Artis sharply curtailed contact with her . Artis claimed that Coronado had intimidated her one evening after the children ’ s sessions , when she stopped in to report that she ’ d found pornography on a computer Cunningham gave one son . Coronado accused Artis of defending Cunningham , since he was the one paying her bills . Several days later , Artis emailed to say she would no longer meet Coronado in person or by phone , and would only communicate in writing . Then she wrote Cunningham ’ s attorney to tell him what happened .
While Coronado admits she didn ’ t handle the exchange with Artis well , she said there was more to the story . Earlier that day , she ’ d received a subpoena from the prosecutor ’ s office demanding that she testify about the alleged 2013 assault . But when she mentioned it to Artis , Coronado later told the court , Artis “ told me Ed never hit me , I had made it up . ”
It was , to her , a surreal moment : “ The state of Texas is demanding that I testify in an assault where I was the victim , and a mental health professional just looked at me and said ‘ it didn ’ t happen . ’ ”
McMillan described in a deposition what she saw as a pattern of Coronado discouraging the older children ’ s relationship with Cunningham . She deduced that pattern , she ’ d later testify , from the children ’ s behavior alone , such as the daughter rebuffing McMillan ’ s attempts to talk kindly about her father by repeating that he had cheated , hit her mom , and left . McMillan acknowledged that she hadn ’ t actually assessed Coronado for alienation , but argued , “ The refusal to see their father is parental alienation by definition . ”
We Are Witnesses Intimate portraits of people who have been touched by the criminal justice system
The therapists ’ assessments proved damning when Coronado returned to court at the end of 2014 . By then , the lawyer who ’ d brought her custody modification suit had retired , and , making just $ 47,000 at her new administrative job , Coronado couldn ’ t afford to replace her . At times , before the hearing , she represented herself while her ex ’ s attorney , Charles Bowes , argued for his primary custody . Cunningham was granted temporary custody of the three boys . The daughter , who maintained that she ’ d witnessed Cunningham hit Coronado , was so estranged from him that the therapists suggested she remain with her mother and undergo reunification therapy .
Coronado herself was ordered into parental alienation therapy and put on supervised visitation : allowed to see her sons just four hours a week , in the company of a social worker , who submitted notes on their interactions . Although the order was meant to be temporary , due to continuances on both sides , it would stretch longer than a year .
The concept of parental alienation can be traced to the mid-1980s , when child psychiatrist Richard Gardner first began using the term to describe what he called the “ brainwashing ” of children by one parent to view the other parent as “ all bad. ” He charged that the most severe allegations of child abuse that arise during divorce are the fabrication of mothers seeking “ the total elimination of the father . ”
That gender breakdown was no accident : Gardner argued that in some 90 percent of alienation cases he ’ d observed , mothers were at fault . He suggested that alienating mothers might have pathologies such as borderline or narcissistic personality disorder , or that the phenomenon could be explained by “ the old saying , ‘ Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. ’ ” Some of his remedies were severe : immediately removing children from the home of the “ alienating parent , ” and warning children who balked at custodial visits that unless they respected their fathers , their mothers would be locked up .
Neither this syndrome nor its offshoot—more commonly known today as simply “ Parental Alienation ” —have ever been officially accepted by the psychological establishment , despite repeated campaigns to include it in the authoritative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . ( Advocates of the term argue that similar diagnoses are in the manual and parental alienation ’ s absence doesn ’ t prove that it ’ s been discredited . ) Nonetheless , Gardner became a frequent courtroom expert , appearing—for lucrative fees—in an estimated 400 cases . In time , his reputation became tarnished : men ’ s rights activists became the most ardent proponents of his theory , and Gardner ’ s odd statements—like hypothetically suggesting that mothers punish children who report sexual abuse by their fathers—came to light .
In 2003 , Gardner killed himself . But a cottage industry of followers continued his work , and his theory remains highly disputed . The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges stated more than a decade ago that courts shouldn ’ t accept testimony regarding the “ discredited ” parental alienation syndrome . But other elements of the legal system proved more credulous , and parental alienation became such a common tactic in custody disputes that some women ’ s rights advocates call it a public health crisis . They believe that parental alienation often obscures domestic violence or child abuse , because the theory suggests that children being estranged from their fathers is due to their mothers ’ brainwashing , instead of , say , the result of their having experienced or witnessed abuse .
Richard Warshak , a leading proponent of parental alienation theory , has written that many critics misunderstand the theory or create a straw man to dismiss it . “ It is well-known that children can be , and are , taught to hate and fear other people for no good reason , ” he wrote in a 2003 paper . “ There is no reason to assume that parents are exempt from becoming the target of such irrational feelings. ” But , more recently , he also noted the risk of “ false positives ” as custody evaluators and expert witnesses “ wield the concept of parental alienation like a blunt sword , ” and sometimes the court “ [ fails ] to recognize that a child ’ s rejection is a justifiable response to a parent ’ s violence , abuse , or other form of gross mistreatment . ”
It ’ s hard to determine how often parental alienation claims affect custody cases . Many family court sessions are closed to the public , and cases that aren ’ t appealed—which is most of them—don ’ t make it into the public record .
In an effort to assess whether the theory has become “ a gender-biased vehicle for negating legitimate abuse claims , ” Meier and her co-author , Sean Dickson , examined nearly 4,400 family court cases from 2005 to 2015 , and found that 16 percent were influenced by allegations of parental alienation . Factoring in opinions that didn ’ t use the exact term but echoed that reasoning , the percentage was closer to one-quarter . The real number might even be higher , said Meier , since the study couldn ’ t capture cases like Coronado ’ s , where alienation claims were extensively litigated , but not referenced in the judge ’ s final opinion . And the effects were stark : When fathers countered mothers ’ allegations of domestic violence or child abuse with charges of parental alienation , women ’ s rate of losing custody doubled .
Even proving abuse didn ’ t always help , since even in the small subset of cases where the court believed abuse took place , but also that the mother had alienated the children , women still lost custody nearly one-third of the time .
In early 2015 , as Coronado and Cunningham ’ s custody battle dragged on , another therapist , Dr. Alissa Sherry , stepped in to conduct the psychological evaluations of the parents that Judge Sheppard ordered .
Sherry ran personality tests on both of them , in addition to speaking with people who might back up their claims . Coronado brought her lawyer ’ s training , her mounting frustration at previous therapists ’ seeming disbelief in her domestic abuse claims , and her characteristic tenacity . Eager to explain the context behind the charges of parental alienation , she showed Sherry a timeline she ’ d created chronicling Cunningham ’ s alleged abuse . In addition to the 2013 police report , it included photographs of her injuries , a medical report and a letter from the Travis County Sheriff ’ s department related to the 1998 assault , although not that actual police record , which she hadn ’ t yet obtained .
In May 2015 , Sherry delivered her findings . At 110 pages , the evaluation focused heavily on Coronado : a woman Sherry found “ exceptionally bright ” but sometimes prone to emotional overreaction , defensiveness , and misperceptions of reality . Most damningly , Sherry wrote that she met the criteria for borderline personality disorder—what one psychologist described as “ the worst diagnosis you could get as a mother ” in a custody battle—based substantially on what Sherry saw as her overly-negative description of her relationship with Cunningham . “ [ W ] ith Ms. Coronado , ” Sherry wrote , “ the entire relationship from start to finish in her report was so bad it left one wondering why a graduate school educated woman married such a monster. ” ( In an interview , Sherry later said she meant the remark as a comment on Coronado “ overselling ” her claims of Cunningham ’ s abuse . )
Sherry seemed skeptical of Coronado ’ s claims of domestic abuse , saying most of her accusations couldn ’ t be confirmed or “ left out key details implicating her own erratic behavior as the cause of the conflict. ” As an example , Sherry wrote that Coronado hadn ’ t provided compelling proof of the 1998 assault , and the photographs and medical records she ’ d offered in place of a police report could have resulted from anyone assaulting her at any time , not specifically Cunningham , who , Sherry wrote , “ does not remember any kind of altercation between them during that time. ” Although Sherry noted there was no one to confirm his side of the story either , elsewhere in the report she suggested that , since he was so much bigger than Coronado , if he ’ d really abused her , it would have been obvious .
If she ’ d had a copy of the 1998 police report , Sherry later said , and it had been corroborated , “ You bet I would have a different opinion about it all . ”
The shortcomings Sherry found in Cunningham were far more limited : that he could be “ overly trusting and optimistic ” — “ happy-go-lucky , ” she ’ d later testify—and that , by his own admission , he ’ d been frequently unfaithful ( though Sherry found this confession a mark of credibility since he was forthcoming about “ less than admirable behavior ” ) .
Case in Point An examination of a single case that sheds light on the criminal justice system
Cunningham somehow obtained Coronado ’ s timeline—not , Sherry noted in the evaluation , from her—and wrote responses that Sherry included in her report . He argued that Coronado had nearly “ stalked ” him at the start of their relationship , had sometimes brought the children into their bedroom to watch them fight , and forced him , after their separation , to visit the children only at her house . He told Sherry she had used the 2013 assault charge as a bargaining chip , “ telling him that if he would just leave his current partner and call off the divorce , she would ‘ make this go away. ’ ” ( One of Coronado ’ s attorneys requested that , since Cunningham had been given the chance to rebut Coronado ’ s timeline , they be provided his responses as well . Sherry responded that they should ask Cunningham ’ s lawyer instead . )
When a therapist from a domestic violence clinic told Sherry that Coronado had the highest possible score on their assessment of relationship danger—since Cunningham had access to weapons and Coronado reported that he ’ d once made a threat , to a friend of hers , to harm the children—Sherry dismissed that allegation . “ No evidence was provided to us that suggests this is a credible statement , ” she wrote .
Yet , Coronado said , Sherry declined to speak to the people most familiar with her side of the story , including the friend who said , in a signed affidavit , that an irate Cunningham had called her around 2010 , convinced Coronado was cheating , and threatening to kill his family . Sherry ’ s report cites Cunningham ’ s parents and new wife to corroborate his perspective . But it includes no one from Coronado ’ s family—not her father , who recalled Cunningham as mentally abusive and domineering ; nor her brother , whom Coronado confided in for years ; nor her cousin , who worked on Cunningham ’ s Senate campaign and also fielded his angry and suspicious calls . Although Sherry later told me she had no record of these names in her work plan for the case , an email from Coronado ’ s lawyer at the time included the names of all three family members as well as additional friends of Coronado ’ s . In her email response to the attorney , Sherry suggested that speaking to them would just add to the evaluation ’ s expense and that she did not generally speak to people who served mainly as “ character witnesses . ”
“ Less than one percent of the people that get divorced and fight over the children end up in an office like mine , ” Sherry said . “ So the people that come to me are always going to be the worst of the worst . ”
Noting that she ’ d done post-doctoral work on domestic violence , Sherry argued that violence in these sorts of families should be understood differently . She maintained that she saw as many women abuse men as the reverse , that some women had self-inflicted their wounds , and that she believed true domestic violence victims would be less likely to end up in her office because they ’ d have been intimidated into settling their cases earlier on . Sherry discussed Coronado ’ s case with some vehemence , calling her “ manipulative ” or even “ psychopathically ” manipulative more than 15 times , and suggesting she had been the violent partner in her marriage . And she stressed that multiple mental health professionals and judges had independently found Coronado ’ s behavior “ detrimental to the best interests of her children . ”
Although Sherry wrote that it was beyond her scope to assess whether the family had experienced parental alienation , she spent four pages at the end of the report outlining literature on the topic . In her report , Sherry also said she could not determine whether domestic abuse had taken place . But in later testimony she would declare , “ I am more convinced that Mrs. Coronado is manipulating the situation and being manipulative than I am convinced that Mr. Cunningham is this abusive monster . ”
Coronado identified 27 instances where she believed Sherry was wrong or had taken Cunningham ’ s word on something she could disprove—things she would have challenged , she said , had she been given the chance . She collated emails and texts , lawsuits and affidavits , into a thick three-ring binder , and enlisted a retired police chief to help locate her long-buried 1998 report alleging assault , hoping her evidence would outweigh Sherry ’ s evaluation .
In the aftermath of losing custody of her sons , Coronado sought pro bono legal representation from UT ’ s Domestic Violence Law Clinic . Margaret Bassett joined the team to help keep Coronado ’ s trauma from undermining her case , since she said abuse victims ’ efforts to convince authorities can come across as unstable and frantic . Bassett believed that behavior was indicative of a traumatic past : “ Somebody who ’ s been in an abusive relationship is in a heightened sense of awareness , because everything they do , when they ’ re operating out of fear , is about safety . ”
Therapists and custody evaluators who refuse to recognize that , she continued , will interpret trauma as instability—or , as Sherry did , see Coronado ’ s vigilance and defensiveness as symptoms of a personality disorder , rather than something that presents almost identically : post-traumatic stress .
No other psychologist has diagnosed Coronado with borderline personality disorder , although she has been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety . In court testimony , Sherry said she ’ d ruled out a PTSD diagnosis based on Coronado ’ s reported symptoms . In a later interview , Sherry said her diagnosis was based on multiple criteria , and suggested that Coronado may have “ managed to manipulate other mental health professionals ” who weren ’ t forensic psychologists .
Lundy Bancroft , a domestic violence expert whose books have become classics in the field , believes that psychological testing in custody disputes is inherently unethical : “ The symptoms of trauma are reflected on a psychological test as things that are wrong with you , not things that were done to you . ”
Meier , who was familiar with some aspects of Coronado ’ s case , said the professionals ’ dismissal of the alleged abuse history was common . In fact , one 1996 survey of psychological custody evaluators found that while 75 percent recommended denying custody to “ alienating ” parents , most didn ’ t consider domestic violence a substantial issue in their determinations . Sherry said Cunningham wasn ’ t living with Coronado anymore , so her domestic violence allegations were irrelevant .
When one of Coronado ’ s new pro bono attorneys deposed McMillan , the therapist who ’ d evaluated the older children , he asked how Coronado should explain Cunningham ’ s alleged abuse to her children in a way that would not be interpreted as parental alienation . McMillan ’ s answer was pitiless : Coronado would need to tell them , she said , “ why she stayed for 17 years and allowed that to happen to her . ”
In January 2016 , more than a year after the three boys were removed from Coronado ’ s custody , she and Cunningham finally returned to court . Coronado was up against significant odds . In addition to the damning therapist reports , the judge ruled that no direct evidence could be submitted about events that took place before the divorce decree was signed—which meant no direct testimony about domestic abuse . The decision was based on a legal principle called Res judicata , which holds that a legal matter that ’ s already been—or should have been—litigated can not be raised again in a new case . In other words , as Sherry would write in her report , the time for Coronado to have pursued her domestic violence allegations was during the divorce , not during a later attempt to change custody arrangements .
So in the trial , Coronado ’ s pro bono lawyers could only make an “ offer of proof ” : a document entered into the record in case of appeal , containing evidence that might have led to a different outcome if it had been admitted . They submitted 94 pages , including the 1998 and 2013 police reports , photographs of Coronado ’ s blackened eye and swollen face , her gashed and bruised body , a bite mark on her thigh and finger-shaped bruises on her arm .

After summarizing the case history , Charles Bowes , Cunningham ’ s attorney , opened by suggesting that , “ with the disorder [ Coronado ’ s ] been diagnosed with by Dr. Sherry , she may not have the ability to change. ” He discussed with Sherry whether Coronado ’ s daughter , who had been acting out , would develop a personality disorder herself if she stayed in her mother ’ s home . And he had Coronado read out loud the angry emails she ’ d sent Cunningham .
Coronado had come to appreciate how poorly victims come across in court . So she tried to explain and apologize . “ I am mortified with these readings , ” she told Bowes . “ You can have me go through every email , Charlie , and I ’ m not going to argue and say that any of them were right . I was scared .... I did not respond in ways that I wished I had and I wouldn ’ t do it again . ”
Bowes responded in disgust , punctuating each word : “ Who . Filed . This . Case ? ”
“ We had prepared her that this was going to be really , really hard , ” said Lungwitz , who helped with Coronado ’ s case . “ This case hinged on the experts , and we couldn ’ t stop the train . ”
Shortly before the judge made her ruling , Cunningham reached out to Coronado , repeating an offer he ’ d made before the start of the trial : she could keep custody of their daughter , who ’ d maintained to therapists that she ’ d witnessed her father ’ s abuse , and he would get custody of the sons . Coronado turned down the deal , and Cunningham won all four . She was taken off supervised visits and granted standard visitation , while he got the “ big rights ” : physical and legal custody , including the right to determine the children ’ s medical and psychiatric care . That week , as Cunningham ’ s legal team had been urging , their daughter was picked up by a company of transporters and sent to a wilderness therapy program in the Utah desert . She was gone for a year .
“ The final kick , ” Coronado said , “ was as soon as my daughter was shipped off , he took a plea. ” Although Coronado had wanted the criminal case against Cunningham prosecuted , Sherry ’ s evaluation had been forwarded extensively : to any new therapists the children might see , and to the Travis County Attorney ’ s office . The prosecutor who ’ d convinced her to participate in the case was no longer there , and Coronado said his replacement , Neha Naik , told her that , given the evaluation , she didn ’ t think they could win . In an email , Naik wrote that she ’ d said “ there would be hurdles if we proceeded to trial , given the evidence we had , ” and that the evaluation “ did not play a large part in our decision . ”
And so , in the months after the custody trial , Cunningham accepted a deal on the domestic abuse charge in the form of a “ deferred prosecution agreement ” or DPA—a legal instrument that allows defendants to avoid prosecution if they abide by a set of probation-like terms . For Cunningham that meant his charge would be provisionally dismissed if he stayed away from Coronado and underwent therapy—therapy he was allowed to undergo with LeAnn Artis , the therapist who ’ d testified about her belief that Coronado had alienated the children from their father . Beyond that , the specifics of his DPA were unknown , since Coronado wasn ’ t given a copy and these deals aren ’ t subject to open-records requests . Effectively , they ’ re sealed , meaning not even Coronado could see the contents of the agreement ostensibly meant to protect her .
The older children turned 18 and went on to college ; neither immediately moved back to Coronado ’ s house once they had the chance , though they frequently visited and stayed at her home . In April 2016 , after an encounter with Cunningham that she believed was a violation of the terms of his plea deal , Coronado tried to obtain the deferred prosecution agreement , to see exactly what the provisions protecting her said . When the county attorney ’ s office refused , Coronado ’ s request became a fierce local battle , drawing in the state attorney general and generating news coverage that included a photo of her bruised face and blackened eye .
Ultimately , after a year-long fight , the county agreed to turn it over but required Corondao to sign a non-disclosure agreement , forbidding her from discussing its contents with anyone other than lawyers or therapists . But she could bring it to court . And in August 2017 , she did , during a hearing wherein Cunningham sought ( successfully ) to send another of the children to a behavioral boot camp in Utah . Although Cunningham protested that he ’ d only signed the agreement to dismiss the charges against him , on the second page of the DPA ( obtained through a court records request ) , just above his signature , were the words Coronado had hoped to find : “ I understand the allegations against me . I hereby voluntarily confess that they are true . ”
In 2017 Coronado hired a San Antonio psychologist , Joann Murphey , who agreed to reassess Sherry ’ s report . Murphey described what she saw as Sherry ’ s “ apparent bias ” against Coronado : `` Where your behaviors are characterized in terms of gross psychopathology , Ed 's behaviors ( and how they might have affected you and/or his children ) are glossed over . ''
Armed with Murphey ’ s report and the deferred prosecution agreement , in 2018 , Coronado moved to modify custody again . Cunningham contended , in comments to the Austin American-Statesman as well as in his 2017 court testimony , that the DPA doesn ’ t represent a confession and that he only signed it to stop the custody battle from dragging on further . But last year , he offered to settle , giving Coronado nearly 50-50 custody . As of July , three of the four children were living with Coronado full time , and the fourth lived in an off-campus apartment .
For Coronado , it marked the resolution of an epic fight , but there was broader fallout from the case . In late 2014 , shortly before losing custody of her sons , she had filed a complaint against Artis with one of her two licensing boards . She argued that Artis ’ s behavior “ indicates a bias on behalf of my ex-husband who is 100 % responsible for her fees , ” and claimed that Artis had worked with Cunningham and his attorney to craft the alienation argument against her . That complaint , Coronado said , had quickly been turned against her , cited in court arguments and Sherry ’ s report to suggest that she was unstable and conflict-driven , and couldn ’ t take responsibility for her own actions . But in 2019 , more than four years later , committees for both Artis ’ s boards , overseeing marriage and family therapists and personal counselors , proposed suspending her licenses . Coronado sent the boards additional information about Artis ’ s “ dual relationship ” with Cunningham , including that she ’ d conducted his court-ordered therapy after testifying in his favor , and that she ’ d posted effusive comments on Boone ’ s social media pages . In October , Artis agreed to the “ disciplinary surrender ” of one of her licenses . And this February , following an internal review process , the second board found Artis had violated codes governing professional boundaries and relationships , and accepted the disciplinary surrender of her counselor ’ s license as well .
Separately , in 2019 , at a heated public quarterly meeting of the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists , Sherry announced she would no longer accept any court appointments for custody or psychological evaluations because of a barrage of “ frivolous , expensive , and time consuming board complaints. ” In the audience , a number of Sherry ’ s former clients burst into applause . Roughly a dozen parents also spoke , many alleging that Sherry had evaluated them or their children in ways that echoed Coronado ’ s claims , including two who said Sherry had improperly diagnosed them with borderline personality disorder .
In a later interview , Sherry clarified that while she intends to stop taking family law appointments , she is still working on some . She pointed out that conducting court-ordered forensic evaluations is almost inherently guaranteed to anger one side or the other . The parents who have criticized her , she said , comprise an organized campaign of disgruntled former clients using regulatory board complaints as a litigation and harassment tactic .
Coronado ’ s fight to obtain the deferred prosecution agreement also revealed a larger issue with the way Travis County handled domestic violence complaints—relying on the secretive agreements in roughly 20 percent of cases as of 2017 and generating complaints that sentences were too light . With the help of government transparency attorney Bill Aleshire , Coronado filed numerous open records requests seeking to uncover what they believed were thousands of DPAs issued by the county prosecutor .
Since the news of her fight for the deferred prosecution agreement was published , Coronado finds herself receiving regular calls from women across the country , asking how she manages to still see her kids . They haven ’ t seen theirs , they say , in 18 months , or five years . Sometimes , she said , it ’ s hard to listen . They sound like she did four years ago : the same frantic urgency ; the same conviction—which she now considers naive—that they can win if they make the court understand .
Recently , Coronado said , a woman who had supervised her custody visits asked if she ’ d speak to another of her clients—a mother who ’ d been on supervised visitation for a year-and-a-half , but could no longer afford to pay for it , and was about to forfeit the right to see her children at all . The supervisor hoped Coronado could offer some advice .
“ She said I ’ d basically won , ” Coronado said , floored by the suggestion . “ I feel so broken and humiliated by the whole process that it ’ s amazing someone thinks I won . ”","Tara Coronado, a 45-year-old mother of four, sat in a nondescript Austin courtroom six years ago during a custody fight with her ex-husband, biting her tongue as the judge dressed her down.

“There is a huge amount of anger coming from you,” said Judge Susan Sheppard. “You deny it and are obviously not recognizing how almost every piece of information you give the Court is tinged by, tainted by, influenced by your overwhelming anger and hurt.”

Coronado was angry. A slender Mexican-American woman with long dark hair and a whip-quick mind, she’d scraped her way up from a New Mexico trailer park to serve in the Peace Corps and graduate from the University of Texas Law School. She married Ed Cunningham, a former football star turned lawyer and businessman, and had three boys and a girl. And she’d stayed home to raise them, for long stretches on her own, through a tumultuous 15-year-marriage that broke down when she discovered her husband had bought a second house across town where he was having an affair with another woman.

Outside their custody battle, Cunningham was facing a separate criminal charge of assaulting Coronado shortly before their divorce—allegations he adamantly denied. In a 2013 police report that included photographs of her injuries, Coronado told authorities that he’d punched her in the face, kneed her in the chest and dragged her by her hair across the road, resulting in a black eye, bruises and abrasions on her back and legs. Coronado obtained an emergency protection order, and Cunningham was arrested.

But a year later, in front of the court, it was Coronado under scrutiny. Cunningham’s attorney and a court-appointed therapist cast her as vindictive and unstable, fabricating abuse claims in retaliation for his infidelity; insulting his new wife, Aimee Boone; and poisoning their children against him.

By her own admission, amid their operatic, years-long separation and divorce, Coronado had sometimes acted badly. During fights, sometimes in front of the kids, she called Boone ugly names. In texts, she swung between castigating Cunningham for abandoning his family and begging him to call.

At one point during the trial, Cunningham’s attorney suggested she had “a lot of unresolved issues and anger from the divorce.” Coronado shot back, “I have a lot of unresolved issues with putting up with 15 years of getting beaten to be left penniless and raising four children by myself.”

But outbursts like that don’t play well in a family court system that women’s rights advocates say is permeated by gender bias. Judges and court-appointed experts are trying to seek the best interests of children in cases where polarized and combative parents present irreconcilable versions of reality. They point out that in the high-conflict cases they are drawn into, they’re often the target of fury from the parent who loses. Yet some also punish women who appear angry or aggressive; fail to understand how trauma can warp emotions and personal demeanor; and rely on forensic assessments that some experts consider misinformed at best and unethical at worst.

Sheppard approved Cunningham’s request for a psychological evaluation of Coronado. While her order covered both parents, Sheppard’s conclusion seemed clear as she told Coronado she hoped the evaluation might “explain in some way how you have said and done things that reflect so badly on your judgment and on your parenting.” The judge wondered aloud whether the evaluator might find an “Axis II” mental health condition, a category that includes severe diagnoses like borderline personality disorder.

As the custody case dragged through the courts, a parade of therapists—assigned by the court, but paid for by Cunningham—would weigh in, declaring that the problem wasn’t him, but Coronado, whom they described as manipulative, hostile and defensive. They labeled her with a range of diagnoses, from borderline personality disorder—an illness marked by unstable emotions and interpersonal relationships—to the contested theory of “parental alienation”—that is, deliberately estranging the children from their father and coercing them into supporting false claims of abuse.

Cunningham, who denies ever hitting Coronado, declined to speak on the record for this article, although he shared some documents from the case. “Tara has a long history of making false allegations when she gets angry or does not get her way,” he would tell a court-appointed psychologist. “I have always avoided all physical contact with Tara (i.e., except to deflect her blows or to restrain her from hitting me) because I know that she is always looking for a way to gain leverage through her crazy accusations.”

The custody battle turned on how to interpret the same court transcripts and therapists’ reports, which Cunningham’s camp saw as incontrovertible evidence of Coronado’s manipulativeness and instability, and hers read as reflecting profound gender disparities.

Roughly three months after the judge’s order, Cunningham was awarded primary custody of the three boys, and Coronado was relegated to four hours of supervised visitation per week. She met her sons in two-hour increments under the watchful eye of a supervisor she paid $100 an hour—a substantial chunk of the wages of her new administrative job. A year later, she lost custody of her daughter as well.

As Coronado would testify, it was the nightmare realization of threats she claimed her ex made when she’d first filed the police report. “He said he’d take the kids away, take the money away, and tell everyone I was crazy,” she said. “And he’s done all that.”

Conventional wisdom has it that women automatically have the upper hand in custody fights, and a mother claiming she’s been abused has a powerful case to sway the court. But when domestic violence charges are in play, advocates and researchers suggest, mothers are often at a disadvantage.

“The legal system is set up on dealing with agreeableness,” said Margaret Bassett, then the deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin Institute on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault, who would help during Coronado’s case. Family courts often favor the parent who will cooperate to maintain their ex’s relationship with their children.

This “friendly parent” principle, sensible overall, since it’s healthy for most children to maintain bonds with both parents, can become a blind spot—or worse—in cases of alleged abuse. Mothers who charge fathers with domestic violence amid custody battles are often suspected of fabricating the claims as a tactic to win control of their children. But battered women’s advocates suggest that many “high-conflict” divorces—the single-digit fraction of separations that are extensively litigated—are actually domestic violence cases in disguise.

Some research backs this up. One small 1992 study found that there was physical aggression between parents in 70 percent of high-conflict custody fights, and “severe” violence (meaning battery or the threat or use of a weapon) in nearly half. Another study, published in 1997 by the National Center for State Courts and covering several cities, found documented evidence of domestic violence in 20 to 55 percent of contested custody cases. In one city where court mediators screened for it, “much higher” rates of abuse were revealed.

Yet merely raising the issue tends to work against mothers. A 2004 study funded by the National Institute of Justice found that mothers were more likely to receive primary custody if they had not made allegations of domestic abuse, while fathers were equally likely to get custody whether there were allegations against them or not. The study also found that when mediators discovered evidence of violence when the mother hadn’t alleged any, they were more likely to recommend court protections like supervised child exchanges, meaning women who were open about being abused received less protection for themselves and their children than those who were not.

One explanation for the different fates of men and women in family court may be how domestic violence victims can come across: hyper-vigilant, agitated, guarded, volatile. These characteristics can make mothers look unstable or unfit, but are also commonplace reactions to trauma or even symptoms of PTSD.

Many family courts and therapists have not kept pace with a growing understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence, or lack the training to interpret the impact of trauma on abuse victims, domestic violence experts say. And many are swayed by traditional assumptions about men, women and anger.

“An angry woman might be vengeful and fabricating,” said Joan Meier, a George Washington University law school professor and founder of the advocacy organization DV LEAP, which handles appeals for battered women in custody disputes. “But angry fathers? We have no problem with that because of course he’s angry—he’s been kept from his children and there are these lies being promulgated about him. It’s so thick with gender stereotypes, you can cut it with a knife.”

What it adds up to, said UT’s Bassett, is a fateful choice: “If I’m going to court and alleging that my partner is abusive, I’m probably going to lose custody of the children. Do I go to court and risk that, or do I play the game the way it’s set up?”

The two met in 1997, when Cunningham, a lawyer working as a sports agent, spoke to Coronado’s law school class. Cunningham, with his shock of side-swept brown hair and open smile, seemed larger than life. He was almost 6’8 and around 275 pounds, befitting his brief stint in the NFL and before that his status as an All America player for Austin’s storied UT Longhorns. He was in the middle of his first divorce, and their initial romance swept Coronado off her feet.

But within months, she said, the relationship turned violent. When she went with friends to a party at his house and saw him with another woman, their resulting argument culminated in a loud fight in his bathroom where, Coronado told police, Cunningham threw her against the sink and choked her. Upon seeing her bruises, her brother Sam, who lived with her at the time, called the police, and convinced his sister to speak with them. Her friend Sharon Rutman (then Rubin), who’d been outside the bathroom door, gave a police statement as well, describing seeing Cunningham walk out, leaving Coronado splayed on the floor, legs braced against the wall and gasping for air.

While she debated pressing charges, Coronado learned she was pregnant. She reconciled with Cunningham and moved into his stone two-story home in Bee Cave, high in the Hill Country surrounding Austin. When she was six months pregnant, they married, and she settled into home life, having three more children within six years. Cunningham shifted from sports law to other business ventures, and they moved in influential circles. In 2001, Cunningham launched a short-lived campaign for U.S. Senate. Coronado became an intensely involved stay-at-home mother, shepherding their children between sporting events at expensive private schools, coaching some of their teams.

Coronado says their early years were marked by volatility and sporadic violence, with frequent fights about money or Cunningham’s infidelity. She’d later tell numerous friends, as well as a court-appointed psychologist, that sometimes her husband hit, bit or spit on her, destroyed clothes and keepsakes, and that once when she was pregnant, held her on the ground and put a hose in her mouth, choking her with water. Cunningham told the same psychologist, “nothing even remotely close to this is true.”

In interviews with 10 of Coronado’s family members, friends or neighbors, people recalled troubling dynamics about the relationship. Multiple friends described her having bruises that she excused as injuries from sports or yard work, or that she’d wear long-sleeve shirts and pants through the Texas summer. She called her brother so frequently in distress, Sam said, that he ultimately became frustrated with her refusal to leave.

It baffled them. Coronado was smart, competitive, driven and, above all, tough. “Because she’s such a force of nature, it’s harder to believe that she would stay in a relationship that’s violent,” said Jeana Lungwitz, director of the University of Texas School of Law’s Domestic Violence Clinic, who helped on her case.

But that’s not how domestic violence plays out, experts say. Women stay in abusive relationships for many reasons—out of fear, dependence or terror that if they leave they or their children could be in greater danger. Another cause: the paradox of “traumatic bonding” that results from the abusive cycle of good and bad times.

In Coronado’s own calculus, the alleged episodes of violence came amid happy moments—when Cunningham dressed up as Santa Claus and transformed into what she called “over-do it Ed”—as well as long stretches where he was simply gone. (He took a job in China and lived largely away from home for years.) “I justified it,” she said. “It’s not every day, we had a nice life.”

But by the end of 2011, she discovered that Cunningham had bought another house, where he began living part-time, sometimes, she said, during periods when he claimed he was abroad. She learned he was seeing Boone—an heiress to the Container Store fortune, a prominent Democratic donor who’s hosted fundraisers and events for politicians like Barack Obama and Joe Biden and who is now chair of the national board of directors of Planned Parenthood—and that the relationship was serious. (Boone declined an interview request.) Eventually, Cunningham filed for divorce.

Negotiations stalled amid the rancor. By late 2012, an attorney appointed by the court to determine the children’s best interests tried to help the family work out a custody schedule, but removed herself soon after, saying the situation was beyond her control. The parents were so deadlocked, and the children so caught in between, that she believed some of the kids would soon refuse to visit their father. “The pathology in this family,” she wrote, “is acute.”

Then came the May 2013 fight. According to Coronado’s police statement, Cunningham had been staying with her for several days when an argument over money devolved into a shouting match about Boone. In her statement, Coronado said she grabbed Cunningham’s phone, threatening to call Boone, and he charged at her, knocking her to the ground, dropping his knee onto her chest and punching her in the face, before driving away. Cunningham told a court-appointed psychologist that Coronado routinely physically blocked him from leaving the house after visits, and that after stealing his phone she fell while running away; any injuries she had, he suggested, must have resulted from that.

During the altercation, one of Coronado’s neighbors, Kishna Weaver, noticed her dog barking and turned on a light. A short time later, Weaver said in an interview, Coronado came over, looking like she’d been in a fight. Weaver drove her to the police station, and as soon as they arrived, she recalled, an officer in the parking lot saw them and had the same reaction Weaver did: immediately asking Coronado who’d hit her. Bill Pitmon, a lieutenant with the department who later took Coronado’s statement, recalled in an interview how “visibly shaken up” she still seemed nearly a week after the alleged attack. Later that month, Cunningham was arrested for assault family violence, a misdemeanor charge. Within weeks, their divorce settlement, including primary custody for Coronado and extended standard visitation rights for Cunningham, finally went through.

Despite how bad the marriage had been, Coronado was undone by its dissolution. Her friends remember her in the summer of 2013 being “beside herself,” at times almost catatonic, at other times acting erratically. She went to Cunningham’s second house to confront him, and once went inside and mocked Boone’s clothes and broke her makeup case. She insulted Boone to Cunningham, calling her his “new meal ticket,” once using an anti-Semitic slur. In texts submitted to the court as part of the custody battle, she swerved between picking fights and telling him his family needed him. Once, after one of the children told Cunningham that their mother seemed depressed and wasn’t getting out of bed, he came over to stock the house with food and watch the kids. At one point that summer, Coronado texted Cunningham to apologize for the protection order, and in October, she signed a non-prosecution form, noting that she was focusing on her kids and finding work.

But behind the scenes, Coronado charged, Cunningham had been pressuring her to withdraw her abuse complaint. After his arrest, she would testify, he had written that he couldn’t afford to make any more of their divorce settlement payments “until I get through all this litigation you have initiated,” which she believed was a reference to the criminal abuse case. Although Coronado was awarded the family home in the divorce, for months she said Cunningham failed to sign over the deed, and didn’t do so until after she’d signed the non-prosecution form. And in person, she’d also later testify, he threatened to “ruin” her if she helped the prosecution.

In February 2014, Travis County Attorney Jordan Foster tried to convince her to cooperate with the prosecution. “Right now, based on what I’m seeing, it looks to me like he hurt you and I will have to recommend a conviction,” Foster wrote in an email. A few days later, Coronado agreed to speak with him. After word got back to Cunningham that Coronado would participate in the prosecution, she would later testify, his next settlement check bounced. Then, although she would tell the court he’d only exercised a handful of custodial weekends over their nearly two-year separation, right after he and Boone got married, he demanded to resume visitation. To Coronado, it seemed “he was going through with the threats he’d made.”

Cunningham’s version of events is different. He told a court-appointed psychologist that he’d tried to see the children more regularly, but Coronado had restricted him to visits at her house, and had limited even those as his marriage to Boone approached. He said Coronado had failed to arrange for the children to attend his wedding, and had later discouraged visitation, sometimes saying the children didn’t want anything to do with him and other times that they needed therapy first.

Coronado’s attorney at the time filed a custody-modification lawsuit to prevent the children’s visitation with their father until a therapist evaluated them and declared it in their best interests to resume visits. But the gambit backfired immediately, setting off years of litigation and the intervention of several therapists—first to evaluate the children, then Coronado and Cunningham themselves.

Starting in June of 2014, the children began seeing two therapists the court appointed to facilitate their reunification with Cunningham: Dr. Susan McMillan, who treated the older siblings, and LeAnn Artis, who worked primarily with the younger two. (Artis declined to comment for this article, and McMillan could not be reached for comment.)

Neither therapist observed Coronado directly with her children. But they came to believe that she was swaying the children against their father, and they relied heavily on parental alienation theory.

Artis later declared in court that Coronado’s behavior amounted to emotional abuse, and that the family was one of the most extreme cases of parental alienation she’d ever seen. As an example, Artis testified that the youngest boys had changed their stories, from saying they hadn’t witnessed Cunningham hitting their mother to claiming they had. And she felt Coronado was behind one child’s backing out of attending an event for President Obama hosted at the home Cunningham and Boone shared, now valued at $3.75 million.

After a few sessions with Coronado, Artis sharply curtailed contact with her. Artis claimed that Coronado had intimidated her one evening after the children’s sessions, when she stopped in to report that she’d found pornography on a computer Cunningham gave one son. Coronado accused Artis of defending Cunningham, since he was the one paying her bills. Several days later, Artis emailed to say she would no longer meet Coronado in person or by phone, and would only communicate in writing. Then she wrote Cunningham’s attorney to tell him what happened.

While Coronado admits she didn’t handle the exchange with Artis well, she said there was more to the story. Earlier that day, she’d received a subpoena from the prosecutor’s office demanding that she testify about the alleged 2013 assault. But when she mentioned it to Artis, Coronado later told the court, Artis “told me Ed never hit me, I had made it up.”

It was, to her, a surreal moment: “The state of Texas is demanding that I testify in an assault where I was the victim, and a mental health professional just looked at me and said ‘it didn’t happen.’”

McMillan described in a deposition what she saw as a pattern of Coronado discouraging the older children’s relationship with Cunningham. She deduced that pattern, she’d later testify, from the children’s behavior alone, such as the daughter rebuffing McMillan’s attempts to talk kindly about her father by repeating that he had cheated, hit her mom, and left. McMillan acknowledged that she hadn’t actually assessed Coronado for alienation, but argued, “The refusal to see their father is parental alienation by definition.”

The therapists’ assessments proved damning when Coronado returned to court at the end of 2014. By then, the lawyer who’d brought her custody modification suit had retired, and, making just $47,000 at her new administrative job, Coronado couldn’t afford to replace her. At times, before the hearing, she represented herself while her ex’s attorney, Charles Bowes, argued for his primary custody. Cunningham was granted temporary custody of the three boys. The daughter, who maintained that she’d witnessed Cunningham hit Coronado, was so estranged from him that the therapists suggested she remain with her mother and undergo reunification therapy.

Coronado herself was ordered into parental alienation therapy and put on supervised visitation: allowed to see her sons just four hours a week, in the company of a social worker, who submitted notes on their interactions. Although the order was meant to be temporary, due to continuances on both sides, it would stretch longer than a year.

The concept of parental alienation can be traced to the mid-1980s, when child psychiatrist Richard Gardner first began using the term to describe what he called the “brainwashing” of children by one parent to view the other parent as “all bad.” He charged that the most severe allegations of child abuse that arise during divorce are the fabrication of mothers seeking “the total elimination of the father.”

That gender breakdown was no accident: Gardner argued that in some 90 percent of alienation cases he’d observed, mothers were at fault. He suggested that alienating mothers might have pathologies such as borderline or narcissistic personality disorder, or that the phenomenon could be explained by “the old saying, ‘Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.’” Some of his remedies were severe: immediately removing children from the home of the “alienating parent,” and warning children who balked at custodial visits that unless they respected their fathers, their mothers would be locked up.

Neither this syndrome nor its offshoot—more commonly known today as simply “Parental Alienation”—have ever been officially accepted by the psychological establishment, despite repeated campaigns to include it in the authoritative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (Advocates of the term argue that similar diagnoses are in the manual and parental alienation’s absence doesn’t prove that it’s been discredited.) Nonetheless, Gardner became a frequent courtroom expert, appearing—for lucrative fees—in an estimated 400 cases. In time, his reputation became tarnished: men’s rights activists became the most ardent proponents of his theory, and Gardner’s odd statements—like hypothetically suggesting that mothers punish children who report sexual abuse by their fathers—came to light.

In 2003, Gardner killed himself. But a cottage industry of followers continued his work, and his theory remains highly disputed. The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges stated more than a decade ago that courts shouldn’t accept testimony regarding the “discredited” parental alienation syndrome. But other elements of the legal system proved more credulous, and parental alienation became such a common tactic in custody disputes that some women’s rights advocates call it a public health crisis. They believe that parental alienation often obscures domestic violence or child abuse, because the theory suggests that children being estranged from their fathers is due to their mothers’ brainwashing, instead of, say, the result of their having experienced or witnessed abuse.

Richard Warshak, a leading proponent of parental alienation theory, has written that many critics misunderstand the theory or create a straw man to dismiss it. “It is well-known that children can be, and are, taught to hate and fear other people for no good reason,” he wrote in a 2003 paper. “There is no reason to assume that parents are exempt from becoming the target of such irrational feelings.” But, more recently, he also noted the risk of “false positives” as custody evaluators and expert witnesses “wield the concept of parental alienation like a blunt sword,” and sometimes the court “[fails] to recognize that a child’s rejection is a justifiable response to a parent’s violence, abuse, or other form of gross mistreatment.”

It’s hard to determine how often parental alienation claims affect custody cases. Many family court sessions are closed to the public, and cases that aren’t appealed—which is most of them—don’t make it into the public record.

In an effort to assess whether the theory has become “a gender-biased vehicle for negating legitimate abuse claims,” Meier and her co-author, Sean Dickson, examined nearly 4,400 family court cases from 2005 to 2015, and found that 16 percent were influenced by allegations of parental alienation. Factoring in opinions that didn’t use the exact term but echoed that reasoning, the percentage was closer to one-quarter. The real number might even be higher, said Meier, since the study couldn’t capture cases like Coronado’s, where alienation claims were extensively litigated, but not referenced in the judge’s final opinion. And the effects were stark: When fathers countered mothers’ allegations of domestic violence or child abuse with charges of parental alienation, women’s rate of losing custody doubled.

Even proving abuse didn’t always help, since even in the small subset of cases where the court believed abuse took place, but also that the mother had alienated the children, women still lost custody nearly one-third of the time.

In early 2015, as Coronado and Cunningham’s custody battle dragged on, another therapist, Dr. Alissa Sherry, stepped in to conduct the psychological evaluations of the parents that Judge Sheppard ordered.

Sherry ran personality tests on both of them, in addition to speaking with people who might back up their claims. Coronado brought her lawyer’s training, her mounting frustration at previous therapists’ seeming disbelief in her domestic abuse claims, and her characteristic tenacity. Eager to explain the context behind the charges of parental alienation, she showed Sherry a timeline she’d created chronicling Cunningham’s alleged abuse. In addition to the 2013 police report, it included photographs of her injuries, a medical report and a letter from the Travis County Sheriff’s department related to the 1998 assault, although not that actual police record, which she hadn’t yet obtained.

In May 2015, Sherry delivered her findings. At 110 pages, the evaluation focused heavily on Coronado: a woman Sherry found “exceptionally bright” but sometimes prone to emotional overreaction, defensiveness, and misperceptions of reality. Most damningly, Sherry wrote that she met the criteria for borderline personality disorder—what one psychologist described as “the worst diagnosis you could get as a mother” in a custody battle—based substantially on what Sherry saw as her overly-negative description of her relationship with Cunningham. “[W]ith Ms. Coronado,” Sherry wrote, “the entire relationship from start to finish in her report was so bad it left one wondering why a graduate school educated woman married such a monster.” (In an interview, Sherry later said she meant the remark as a comment on Coronado “overselling” her claims of Cunningham’s abuse.)

Sherry seemed skeptical of Coronado’s claims of domestic abuse, saying most of her accusations couldn’t be confirmed or “left out key details implicating her own erratic behavior as the cause of the conflict.” As an example, Sherry wrote that Coronado hadn’t provided compelling proof of the 1998 assault, and the photographs and medical records she’d offered in place of a police report could have resulted from anyone assaulting her at any time, not specifically Cunningham, who, Sherry wrote, “does not remember any kind of altercation between them during that time.” Although Sherry noted there was no one to confirm his side of the story either, elsewhere in the report she suggested that, since he was so much bigger than Coronado, if he’d really abused her, it would have been obvious.

If she’d had a copy of the 1998 police report, Sherry later said, and it had been corroborated, “You bet I would have a different opinion about it all.”

The shortcomings Sherry found in Cunningham were far more limited: that he could be “overly trusting and optimistic”—“happy-go-lucky,” she’d later testify—and that, by his own admission, he’d been frequently unfaithful (though Sherry found this confession a mark of credibility since he was forthcoming about “less than admirable behavior”).

Case in Point An examination of a single case that sheds light on the criminal justice system

Cunningham somehow obtained Coronado’s timeline—not, Sherry noted in the evaluation, from her—and wrote responses that Sherry included in her report. He argued that Coronado had nearly “stalked” him at the start of their relationship, had sometimes brought the children into their bedroom to watch them fight, and forced him, after their separation, to visit the children only at her house. He told Sherry she had used the 2013 assault charge as a bargaining chip, “telling him that if he would just leave his current partner and call off the divorce, she would ‘make this go away.’” (One of Coronado’s attorneys requested that, since Cunningham had been given the chance to rebut Coronado’s timeline, they be provided his responses as well. Sherry responded that they should ask Cunningham’s lawyer instead.)

When a therapist from a domestic violence clinic told Sherry that Coronado had the highest possible score on their assessment of relationship danger—since Cunningham had access to weapons and Coronado reported that he’d once made a threat, to a friend of hers, to harm the children—Sherry dismissed that allegation. “No evidence was provided to us that suggests this is a credible statement,” she wrote.

Yet, Coronado said, Sherry declined to speak to the people most familiar with her side of the story, including the friend who said, in a signed affidavit, that an irate Cunningham had called her around 2010, convinced Coronado was cheating, and threatening to kill his family. Sherry’s report cites Cunningham’s parents and new wife to corroborate his perspective. But it includes no one from Coronado’s family—not her father, who recalled Cunningham as mentally abusive and domineering; nor her brother, whom Coronado confided in for years; nor her cousin, who worked on Cunningham’s Senate campaign and also fielded his angry and suspicious calls. Although Sherry later told me she had no record of these names in her work plan for the case, an email from Coronado’s lawyer at the time included the names of all three family members as well as additional friends of Coronado’s. In her email response to the attorney, Sherry suggested that speaking to them would just add to the evaluation’s expense and that she did not generally speak to people who served mainly as “character witnesses.”

“Less than one percent of the people that get divorced and fight over the children end up in an office like mine,” Sherry said. “So the people that come to me are always going to be the worst of the worst.”

Noting that she’d done post-doctoral work on domestic violence, Sherry argued that violence in these sorts of families should be understood differently. She maintained that she saw as many women abuse men as the reverse, that some women had self-inflicted their wounds, and that she believed true domestic violence victims would be less likely to end up in her office because they’d have been intimidated into settling their cases earlier on. Sherry discussed Coronado’s case with some vehemence, calling her “manipulative” or even “psychopathically” manipulative more than 15 times, and suggesting she had been the violent partner in her marriage. And she stressed that multiple mental health professionals and judges had independently found Coronado’s behavior “detrimental to the best interests of her children.”

Although Sherry wrote that it was beyond her scope to assess whether the family had experienced parental alienation, she spent four pages at the end of the report outlining literature on the topic. In her report, Sherry also said she could not determine whether domestic abuse had taken place. But in later testimony she would declare, “I am more convinced that Mrs. Coronado is manipulating the situation and being manipulative than I am convinced that Mr. Cunningham is this abusive monster.”

Coronado identified 27 instances where she believed Sherry was wrong or had taken Cunningham’s word on something she could disprove—things she would have challenged, she said, had she been given the chance. She collated emails and texts, lawsuits and affidavits, into a thick three-ring binder, and enlisted a retired police chief to help locate her long-buried 1998 report alleging assault, hoping her evidence would outweigh Sherry’s evaluation.

In the aftermath of losing custody of her sons, Coronado sought pro bono legal representation from UT’s Domestic Violence Law Clinic. Margaret Bassett joined the team to help keep Coronado’s trauma from undermining her case, since she said abuse victims’ efforts to convince authorities can come across as unstable and frantic. Bassett believed that behavior was indicative of a traumatic past: “Somebody who’s been in an abusive relationship is in a heightened sense of awareness, because everything they do, when they’re operating out of fear, is about safety.”

Therapists and custody evaluators who refuse to recognize that, she continued, will interpret trauma as instability—or, as Sherry did, see Coronado’s vigilance and defensiveness as symptoms of a personality disorder, rather than something that presents almost identically: post-traumatic stress.

No other psychologist has diagnosed Coronado with borderline personality disorder, although she has been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety. In court testimony, Sherry said she’d ruled out a PTSD diagnosis based on Coronado’s reported symptoms. In a later interview, Sherry said her diagnosis was based on multiple criteria, and suggested that Coronado may have “managed to manipulate other mental health professionals” who weren’t forensic psychologists.

Lundy Bancroft, a domestic violence expert whose books have become classics in the field, believes that psychological testing in custody disputes is inherently unethical: “The symptoms of trauma are reflected on a psychological test as things that are wrong with you, not things that were done to you.”

Meier, who was familiar with some aspects of Coronado’s case, said the professionals’ dismissal of the alleged abuse history was common. In fact, one 1996 survey of psychological custody evaluators found that while 75 percent recommended denying custody to “alienating” parents, most didn’t consider domestic violence a substantial issue in their determinations. Sherry said Cunningham wasn’t living with Coronado anymore, so her domestic violence allegations were irrelevant.

When one of Coronado’s new pro bono attorneys deposed McMillan, the therapist who’d evaluated the older children, he asked how Coronado should explain Cunningham’s alleged abuse to her children in a way that would not be interpreted as parental alienation. McMillan’s answer was pitiless: Coronado would need to tell them, she said, “why she stayed for 17 years and allowed that to happen to her.”

In January 2016, more than a year after the three boys were removed from Coronado’s custody, she and Cunningham finally returned to court. Coronado was up against significant odds. In addition to the damning therapist reports, the judge ruled that no direct evidence could be submitted about events that took place before the divorce decree was signed—which meant no direct testimony about domestic abuse. The decision was based on a legal principle called Res judicata, which holds that a legal matter that’s already been—or should have been—litigated cannot be raised again in a new case. In other words, as Sherry would write in her report, the time for Coronado to have pursued her domestic violence allegations was during the divorce, not during a later attempt to change custody arrangements.

So in the trial, Coronado’s pro bono lawyers could only make an “offer of proof”: a document entered into the record in case of appeal, containing evidence that might have led to a different outcome if it had been admitted. They submitted 94 pages, including the 1998 and 2013 police reports, photographs of Coronado’s blackened eye and swollen face, her gashed and bruised body, a bite mark on her thigh and finger-shaped bruises on her arm.

After summarizing the case history, Charles Bowes, Cunningham’s attorney, opened by suggesting that, “with the disorder [Coronado’s] been diagnosed with by Dr. Sherry, she may not have the ability to change.” He discussed with Sherry whether Coronado’s daughter, who had been acting out, would develop a personality disorder herself if she stayed in her mother’s home. And he had Coronado read out loud the angry emails she’d sent Cunningham.

Coronado had come to appreciate how poorly victims come across in court. So she tried to explain and apologize. “I am mortified with these readings,” she told Bowes. “You can have me go through every email, Charlie, and I’m not going to argue and say that any of them were right. I was scared.... I did not respond in ways that I wished I had and I wouldn’t do it again.”

Bowes responded in disgust, punctuating each word: “Who. Filed. This. Case?”

“We had prepared her that this was going to be really, really hard,” said Lungwitz, who helped with Coronado’s case. “This case hinged on the experts, and we couldn’t stop the train.”

Shortly before the judge made her ruling, Cunningham reached out to Coronado, repeating an offer he’d made before the start of the trial: she could keep custody of their daughter, who’d maintained to therapists that she’d witnessed her father’s abuse, and he would get custody of the sons. Coronado turned down the deal, and Cunningham won all four. She was taken off supervised visits and granted standard visitation, while he got the “big rights”: physical and legal custody, including the right to determine the children’s medical and psychiatric care. That week, as Cunningham’s legal team had been urging, their daughter was picked up by a company of transporters and sent to a wilderness therapy program in the Utah desert. She was gone for a year.

“The final kick,” Coronado said, “was as soon as my daughter was shipped off, he took a plea.” Although Coronado had wanted the criminal case against Cunningham prosecuted, Sherry’s evaluation had been forwarded extensively: to any new therapists the children might see, and to the Travis County Attorney’s office. The prosecutor who’d convinced her to participate in the case was no longer there, and Coronado said his replacement, Neha Naik, told her that, given the evaluation, she didn’t think they could win. In an email, Naik wrote that she’d said “there would be hurdles if we proceeded to trial, given the evidence we had,” and that the evaluation “did not play a large part in our decision.”

And so, in the months after the custody trial, Cunningham accepted a deal on the domestic abuse charge in the form of a “deferred prosecution agreement” or DPA—a legal instrument that allows defendants to avoid prosecution if they abide by a set of probation-like terms. For Cunningham that meant his charge would be provisionally dismissed if he stayed away from Coronado and underwent therapy—therapy he was allowed to undergo with LeAnn Artis, the therapist who’d testified about her belief that Coronado had alienated the children from their father. Beyond that, the specifics of his DPA were unknown, since Coronado wasn’t given a copy and these deals aren’t subject to open-records requests. Effectively, they’re sealed, meaning not even Coronado could see the contents of the agreement ostensibly meant to protect her.

The older children turned 18 and went on to college; neither immediately moved back to Coronado’s house once they had the chance, though they frequently visited and stayed at her home. In April 2016, after an encounter with Cunningham that she believed was a violation of the terms of his plea deal, Coronado tried to obtain the deferred prosecution agreement, to see exactly what the provisions protecting her said. When the county attorney’s office refused, Coronado’s request became a fierce local battle, drawing in the state attorney general and generating news coverage that included a photo of her bruised face and blackened eye.

Ultimately, after a year-long fight, the county agreed to turn it over but required Corondao to sign a non-disclosure agreement, forbidding her from discussing its contents with anyone other than lawyers or therapists. But she could bring it to court. And in August 2017, she did, during a hearing wherein Cunningham sought (successfully) to send another of the children to a behavioral boot camp in Utah. Although Cunningham protested that he’d only signed the agreement to dismiss the charges against him, on the second page of the DPA (obtained through a court records request), just above his signature, were the words Coronado had hoped to find: “I understand the allegations against me. I hereby voluntarily confess that they are true.”

In 2017 Coronado hired a San Antonio psychologist, Joann Murphey, who agreed to reassess Sherry’s report. Murphey described what she saw as Sherry’s “apparent bias” against Coronado: ""Where your behaviors are characterized in terms of gross psychopathology, Ed's behaviors (and how they might have affected you and/or his children) are glossed over.""

Armed with Murphey’s report and the deferred prosecution agreement, in 2018, Coronado moved to modify custody again. Cunningham contended, in comments to the Austin American-Statesman as well as in his 2017 court testimony, that the DPA doesn’t represent a confession and that he only signed it to stop the custody battle from dragging on further. But last year, he offered to settle, giving Coronado nearly 50-50 custody. As of July, three of the four children were living with Coronado full time, and the fourth lived in an off-campus apartment.

For Coronado, it marked the resolution of an epic fight, but there was broader fallout from the case. In late 2014, shortly before losing custody of her sons, she had filed a complaint against Artis with one of her two licensing boards. She argued that Artis’s behavior “indicates a bias on behalf of my ex-husband who is 100% responsible for her fees,” and claimed that Artis had worked with Cunningham and his attorney to craft the alienation argument against her. That complaint, Coronado said, had quickly been turned against her, cited in court arguments and Sherry’s report to suggest that she was unstable and conflict-driven, and couldn’t take responsibility for her own actions. But in 2019, more than four years later, committees for both Artis’s boards, overseeing marriage and family therapists and personal counselors, proposed suspending her licenses. Coronado sent the boards additional information about Artis’s “dual relationship” with Cunningham, including that she’d conducted his court-ordered therapy after testifying in his favor, and that she’d posted effusive comments on Boone’s social media pages. In October, Artis agreed to the “disciplinary surrender” of one of her licenses. And this February, following an internal review process, the second board found Artis had violated codes governing professional boundaries and relationships, and accepted the disciplinary surrender of her counselor’s license as well.

Separately, in 2019, at a heated public quarterly meeting of the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, Sherry announced she would no longer accept any court appointments for custody or psychological evaluations because of a barrage of “frivolous, expensive, and time consuming board complaints.” In the audience, a number of Sherry’s former clients burst into applause. Roughly a dozen parents also spoke, many alleging that Sherry had evaluated them or their children in ways that echoed Coronado’s claims, including two who said Sherry had improperly diagnosed them with borderline personality disorder.

In a later interview, Sherry clarified that while she intends to stop taking family law appointments, she is still working on some. She pointed out that conducting court-ordered forensic evaluations is almost inherently guaranteed to anger one side or the other. The parents who have criticized her, she said, comprise an organized campaign of disgruntled former clients using regulatory board complaints as a litigation and harassment tactic.

Coronado’s fight to obtain the deferred prosecution agreement also revealed a larger issue with the way Travis County handled domestic violence complaints—relying on the secretive agreements in roughly 20 percent of cases as of 2017 and generating complaints that sentences were too light. With the help of government transparency attorney Bill Aleshire, Coronado filed numerous open records requests seeking to uncover what they believed were thousands of DPAs issued by the county prosecutor.

Since the news of her fight for the deferred prosecution agreement was published, Coronado finds herself receiving regular calls from women across the country, asking how she manages to still see her kids. They haven’t seen theirs, they say, in 18 months, or five years. Sometimes, she said, it’s hard to listen. They sound like she did four years ago: the same frantic urgency; the same conviction—which she now considers naive—that they can win if they make the court understand.

Recently, Coronado said, a woman who had supervised her custody visits asked if she’d speak to another of her clients—a mother who’d been on supervised visitation for a year-and-a-half, but could no longer afford to pay for it, and was about to forfeit the right to see her children at all. The supervisor hoped Coronado could offer some advice.

“She said I’d basically won,” Coronado said, floored by the suggestion. “I feel so broken and humiliated by the whole process that it’s amazing someone thinks I won.”",www.themarshallproject.org,center,teptoSVGYxuw4wL2

On Friday, the New England Patriots released Antonio Brown from the team, just 11 days after hiring him. In a game dominated by passing, Mr. Brown is one of the best wide receivers in the National Football League. But three days after joining the 2019 Super Bowl champs, Mr. Brown became the latest moral test of the NFL’s commitment to address violence against women by its players.

1. What’s the case against Antonio Brown?

A civil lawsuit filed Sept. 10 accuses him of two incidents of sexual battery in 2017 and a rape in 2018. He denies the allegations, and a statement by his lawyer says that Mr. Brown had a “consensual personal relationship” with his accuser, Britney Taylor. The two were friends in college, and later he hired her as a personal trainer. Mr. Brown reportedly turned down an offer to settle the suit for $2 million. Another sexual misconduct allegation against Mr. Brown surfaced this week.

2. Could another NFL team hire Mr. Brown?

Yes. Last year, the Kansas City Chiefs cut running back Kareem Hunt after a video emerged of him assaulting a woman in a hotel. He was quickly hired by the Cleveland Browns, and is currently serving an eight-game suspension.

The Patriots released Mr. Brown after he sent intimidating text messages Wednesday to another woman, who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, Sports Illustrated reported. Mr. Brown's agent said on Twitter Friday after his release from the Patriots: ""Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL. He wants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon.’’

After eight years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mr. Brown has been jettisoned from three teams in short order. Most observers say that the accusations - and his off-field behavior - make it unlikely that another team will hire him, at least not this season.

Whether he plays or not is likely to be decided by the NFL. He has not been charged with a crime. He faces a civil lawsuit. But given the controversy, and potential damage to the league’s reputation, if another team chose to hire Mr. Brown, he could be placed on the NFL commissioner’s “exempt list” – effectively a paid suspension.

A player can be put on the exempt list if one of two criteria is met: (1) A player is formally charged with a violent crime. (2) An NFL investigation leads the commissioner to believe a player “may have violated” the league’s personal conduct policy.

On Monday, NFL investigators reportedly met with Ms. Taylor for 10 hours of interviews. With an investigation underway, the NFL commissioner may now have grounds for believing that Mr. Brown “may have violated” the personal conduct policy – the second criteria for a suspension. “The speed at which the league has moved to interview Taylor – coming less than one week after she filed her civil lawsuit – suggests to me that a decision to place Brown on the exempt list is coming sooner rather than later,” writes Daniel Wallach at The Athletic (paid subscription).

sexual_misconduct,New York Times - News,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html,Examining Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden,2020-04-12,"Lisa Lerer, Sydney Ember","From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily. ” Today : A former Senate aide to Joe Biden has accused him of assaulting her in 1993 . My colleague Lisa Lerer examines the allegation . It ’ s Tuesday , April 14 . Lisa , when did you begin reporting this story ?
So about a year ago , we were reporting on allegations from a number of women who came out and said that Joe Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable .
archived recording Tonight , Joe Biden is facing troubling accusations . Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched and kissed her head before a rally in 2014 .
Maybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder , maybe he smelled their hair —
archived recording ( lucy flores ) — out of nowhere , I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders , get up very close to me from behind , lean in , smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head .
But this was all happening in public , at campaign rallies , at fund-raisers .
archived recording 1 He put his hands around my head and pulled me in . archived recording 2 Former congressional aide Amy Lappos told CBS News tonight that Joe Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a fundraiser in Greenwich , Connecticut in 2009 .
And we in the newsroom and in the media , we ’ re really grappling with how to think and talk about this behavior . This wasn ’ t anything like what had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around # MeToo , like Harvey Weinstein or any of that .
archived recording ( lucy flores ) And for the record , I don ’ t believe that it was a bad intention . I ’ m not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed . I felt invaded . I felt that there was a violation of my personal space . There was no —
The women talking about these allegations weren ’ t quite sure what to call it . Some of them said quite vehemently that they didn ’ t consider it sexual harassment . But they wanted the former vice president to be aware of his behavior and how it could make people feel . Others had a slightly different perspective . They thought it was something closer to sexual harassment . So this goes on for really a couple weeks . And in the end , Biden — he doesn ’ t quite apologize .
archived recording ( joe biden ) Today , I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that I ’ ve made to women and some men , and it made them uncomfortable .
But he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has a very touchy feely kind of political style .
archived recording ( joe biden ) In my career , I ’ ve always tried to make a human connection . That ’ s my responsibility , I think . I shake hands , I hug people , I grab men and women by the shoulders and say , you can do this .
But he recognizes that times have changed , and perhaps he needs to change with them and be more respectful of people ’ s space .
archived recording ( joe biden ) You know , social norms have begun to change , they ’ ve shifted , and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset . And I get it . I get it . I hear what they ’ re saying . I understand it . And I ’ ll be much more mindful . That ’ s my responsibility . My responsibility . And I ’ ll meet it .
And then , I met Tara Reade . And she had called me with sort of similar kind of story . Joe Biden had touched her , he ’ d put his hands in her hair , he touched her shoulders , all in public , in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable . But her story had a little bit of a different twist . So she , at the time , had been working in his Senate office . And this was about — I think December 1992 to August 1993 . She was a low-level staffer , a staff assistant . And she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and squeezes of the shoulder . That there had been harassment .
She says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party . He had commented on her looks in the office , in front of other people . And that she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered and permitted this kind of sexual harassment .
And what did you do with Reade ’ s story , with that reporting ?
Well , I talked to her . I talked to her friend , who corroborated a lot of what she was telling me . We did use her allegations to call a whole bunch of people who had worked in Joe Biden ’ s office in the 1990s — particularly the early 1990s , which was the period that Tara Reade was working there — to see if they remembered any kind of harassment , what the environment of the office was at the time . But we didn ’ t really come up with anything all that surprising or explosive . Nobody really confirmed her account at that time . So we actually didn ’ t end up reporting them in the paper . We had already reported on a number of allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with Joe Biden ’ s touching . And we just sort of moved on . And the political world did too . Everyone moved on to the next battle . There was the Mueller report to contend with , and then a really competitive primary , presidential debates started . So this issue of the unwanted touching and Tara ’ s story just never came back up .
Mm hmm . And Lisa , do you think that has something to do with the fact that Biden confronted this , talked about it and said he was learning from it ?
Oh , for sure . But he was really forced into confronting it . I mean , this was a period in March , in April , before Biden had formally announced his presidential bid , where he was going through the process of reconciling a lot of his record with the current mores of the Democratic Party . He was dealing with his criminal justice record , he was dealing with his positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party . And so I think that quasi-apology video was part of that process . You have a Democratic Party that ’ s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender bias , and Biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms — whether he felt they were fair or not — with where the party was . But ultimately , he didn ’ t pay much of a price for it . He announced his campaign a couple three or so weeks later . His opponents never made an issue of this and everything sort of moved on .
Well , you have the primary race . So Biden , as we all know , nosedives . Then he comes back up , he becomes the front-runner . And around that time —
archived recording ( katie halper ) Hello , and welcome to the Katie Halper Show .
archived recording ( katie halper ) Where would you like to start ? Where does the story start for you ? archived recording ( tara reade ) Well , the story starts when I went to work for Joe Biden .
And levels a really serious , serious accusation against Joe Biden , which is basically that he sexually assaulted her .
archived recording ( tara reade ) And my body — I was shaking everywhere , because it was cold all of a sudden , and I was — I don ’ t know , I feel like I was shaking , just everywhere . And I was trying to grasp what had just happened , and what I should do .
And that woman , who tells her story in great detail on this podcast , is Tara Reade .
So what are you thinking at this point ? Because you had already talked to this woman , and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation , right ?
Well , I must admit , I ’ m a little confused , because it didn ’ t come up at all . And so the first thing I did was pull up my notes . And when I look over my notes and I read the story she had told me a year ago , there ’ s some holes in that story she told me . Things I remember thinking that her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was experiencing in the office at the time . That maybe make a little more sense if this other thing had in fact happened — this sexual assault . So I wondered , first of all , had she been truthful the first time around ? Was she being truthful now ? And also , whether I had asked the right questions . Did I miss something because I hadn ’ t called back , because I got caught up with the dynamics of this primary ?
So at this point — after Tara Reade has gone on this podcast , she has made this claim , and you ’ re trying to figure out why she didn ’ t first tell you that same information — how are you now approaching this story , journalistically ?
So I think we all quickly agreed that it wasn ’ t a question of whether we would approach the story , but how . This was a woman who was making very serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached , publicly , against the man who is more than likely to become the Democratic nominee for president . So we had to grapple with these claims . The question was , how ? And I think the natural thing to do — really , the human thing to do — is to go into a story like this and say , do you believe or not believe the person who ’ s making the accusation ? But that ’ s not the journalistic thing to do . We ’ re not judges , we ’ re not the jury , we ’ re not the police department . I was really focused on what we could show to be true and what we could show to not be true . What we had corroboration on , and what we didn ’ t have corroboration on . And what kind of facts we could give voters and the American public about this whole incident , that ’ s already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on social media . People knew about it .
But they didn ’ t know the details , and they didn ’ t really know what was true or not .
And so where do you begin as you ’ re trying to figure this all out ?
Well , so the main thing I needed to do was get Tara Reade back on the phone . So that ’ s where I began .
We ’ ll be right back . So Lisa , tell me about this , I guess , second round of communications that you have with Tara Reade , after she claims that Joe Biden has assaulted her .
So I call her , and we start talking every day . And the obvious first question I ask her is why she didn ’ t tell me about these allegations when we talked a year ago . And she tells me that even though they weren ’ t published in The New York Times , they were published in a local paper . And the feedback she got from that being out there , the kind of death threats and harassment online , made her reluctant to tell the rest of her story . So we talk through all that , and then eventually , I say to her that I need her to tell me the story that she told on that podcast in a way that we can use on the record . And I start recording her .
interposing voices Hello ? Can you hear me ? Yeah , I hear you . Yep , I got you .
lisa lerer So where do you want to start ? tara reade OK . So let ’ s start with the assault .
So the story that I ’ m about to tell you is all according to Tara Reade . So it ’ s 1993 , in the spring some time , and she ’ s working as a staff assistant in Joe Biden ’ s Senate office . And one day , she ’ s at work , and her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag — this gym bag — and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym bag .
tara reade She just said , take him his gym bag , hurry ! And she was like , he ’ ll meet you , he ’ s down towards the Capitol .
So she heads down and finds him somewhere in the Capitol complex of offices .
tara reade And I ran into him , like I saw him , and I — he acknowledged me , he was talking to someone , they walked away . And then he said , come here , Tara . And then he smiled at me , greeted me .
tara reade I called him “ Senator. ” I didn ’ t call him “ Joe. ” And I handed him the bag with my right hand , I remember that .
And the next thing she remembers , he ’ s pinned her up against a wall , which she remembers as being very , very cold . And he ’ s kissing her .
tara reade It happened at once , and that ’ s what ’ s so hard about telling this story . Like he ’ s talking to me , and his hands are everywhere , and everything ’ s happening at once very quickly . This happened , like , in under two minutes .
And according to Tara , he reaches his hand under her shirt — she remembers she was wearing a cream-colored blouse — grabs her left breast .
tara reade He used his knee to part my knees , because my legs went together . And he went kind of down my skirt , and then as he ’ s parting my legs with his knee , he like went up , and then just went under . And then , of course , yeah , he was able to do what he did , which was he took — it felt like one or two fingers , and inserted them in my vagina .
And at that point , he ’ s kissing her and he says to her , she says , do you want to go somewhere else ? And he tried — she said — to kiss her on the mouth , but she moves her head .
tara reade And then he pulled back , because I wasn ’ t responding to him , I wasn ’ t kissing him back . I completely froze up , and he had kind of lifted me up , so I was like up on my tippy toes almost . And then he looked back and he looked at me —
And he looks at her , and he says , according to her —
tara reade Come on , man . I heard you liked me . Then he smiled , but then when I looked at his eyes , he was angry . Like there —
And she said she remembers standing there , just kind of frozen , and she felt almost a little bad , like she had put him in a bad position . And she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be interested in this . And according to Tara , he looked her and he said —
tara reade He pointed his finger at me and he just goes , you ’ re — you ’ re nothing to me . And then he looked at me , and he goes , nothing .
You ’ re nothing to me . Nothing . And she thinks she must have looked a certain way or had a certain expression in her eye , because then he kind of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders , and said , you ’ re OK , you ’ re fine . And he kind of almost set her down , she said , and then he walked off and walked down the hall .
tara reade I know I went to the restroom , I know I did , to clean up . But I don ’ t remember which restroom I went to in the Russell Building or there — I don ’ t know . But I know I did . But my vivid memory next is sitting — I was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at the Russell Building with those big windows . I remember just sitting on the stairs , and nobody was there . And just like my whole body was literally — I couldn ’ t control my shaking . I remember just being so cold . So cold .
And then she headed home . She doesn ’ t remember how she got there . She doesn ’ t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag or talked to anybody . But she made it home to her apartment .
tara reade The next thing I remember is being on the phone with my mom and crying and then arguing with her .
And her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to immediately file a police report .
tara reade You know , she even swore at me . She was not being gentle and supportive , and I understand , because she wanted me to have evidence . And now I understand what she was trying to do , and I didn ’ t then .
And does she say why she did not go to the police ?
Well , what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to go away , is what she told me . That after it happened , she took a shower . She says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time .
tara reade I threw everything out . Even the shoes . Everything . Like , I just — that ’ s how I felt about it . lisa lerer Really ? What kind of —
She tells me that she called in sick to work , that she was sobbing uncontrollably .
tara reade It ’ s like I just didn ’ t want it to have happened . It just didn ’ t happen .
And what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after this alleged incident ?
So she tells me eventually she does go back to work . And when she does , she says that she tells her immediate supervisor , who ’ s Biden ’ s personal secretary , as well as two top staffers in the office — the deputy chief of staff and the chief of staff — that she feels uncomfortable around Joe Biden . She never mentions the alleged assault , but she talks more about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling his hands in her hair . And in her telling , the staff don ’ t really do anything about that . In fact , she feels that they kind of penalize her for bringing that forward . She says they strip her of one of her duties , which is supervising the interns . She says they put her in a windowless office , far from the rest of the staff . So at some point , she says that she goes to a Senate personnel office and files a formal complaint .
She said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw as retaliation in the office . But she believes that that forum eventually was returned to Biden ’ s office , which would have been a flouting of what the official protocol was at that time . And once that complaint was returned to Biden ’ s office , she says , she was given a month to find a new job , and basically eased out of her position . And so she started looking for another position on Capitol Hill , she says , and never ended up getting hired or finding anything .
So Lisa , once Tara Reade has given you this account of an alleged attack , what do you do next ?
So at this point , she ’ s told me a lot of information . And some really detailed information too . So I start thinking about what can be corroborated , what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not true . And one thing that Tara mentions to me is that at the time , she had called a friend and told her the whole story . So I tracked down the friend .
And in large part , she corroborates the story that Tara had told me . Tara tells me she also told her mother . Her mother is deceased , so she can ’ t be called . And she told a version of her story to her brother , though not all the details . So I start trying to track down her brother . And she tells me she told a friend in 2008 , after Joe Biden had been picked as Barack Obama ’ s vice president . She had told a version of this story to that friend , without all the details , but that something had happened to her . So I tracked down that friend , and she confirms that account and some of the things that Tara tells me .
So it leaves us with something , but certainly not enough to corroborate this entire story . We really only have the one friend with the full story , and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces . So that ’ s not the kind of full corroboration that you ’ re looking for as a journalist , when you ’ re trying to confirm really serious allegations and also really politically explosive allegations . But at this point , it ’ s time to turn to the Biden side of things . So along with my colleague Sydney Ember , we start looking at who we can talk to . And we start by calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that Tara had mentioned she had spoken with , and she had raised those complaints of harassment to . All three of them say that a woman named Tara Reade never approached them with these kind of allegations , and two of them said they didn ’ t remember her at all even working in the office .
So just to be clear , the three people that Tara Reade said she went to and told of Biden ’ s behavior that made her uncomfortable , pretty senior people in his office , they say they have no recollection of that ever happening ?
Exactly . They have no recollection . And a lot of the former staffers are mystified by her account too . They don ’ t remember anything like this , or even the hint of anything like this . So they — when Sydney and I call them , they ’ re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they remember from working in that office . A lot of them didn ’ t want to talk on the record . One who did said that at the time , you knew who the good guys and bad guys were on the Senate . The places where — offices where women would and would not want to work , and she described Biden as one of the good guys .
So after that , we reached out to another group of people , which is the interns . And that ’ s because Tara had told me that she supervised the interns , and that she shared an office with these interns . So I reached two of them , and they both tell me that they ’ d never heard of anything , never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault Tara had been alleging . But that they did remember midway through their internship , sometime in April , she had been suddenly removed as their boss . And they never knew why , and they never saw her again . So amid all this confusion , I remember that there ’ s one thing that really could cut through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen .
And that ’ s this complaint that Tara had told me she filed in 1993 with the Senate office —
— and that someone had written down . So we start trying to track down that complaint . And we call the Federal Office of Personnel Management , and they tell us to file a Freedom of Information request , which would take months , if not years . And anyhow , we don ’ t really know exactly what we ’ re asking for , because she doesn ’ t remember the name of the office where she filed this complaint .
We call over to the Senate and we ’ re able to get some employment records , but not this complaint . So we basically look for this document and come up empty . It ’ s unfindable in the end .
What about other aspects of Reade ’ s life that might feel relevant ? I mean , possible political affiliations or motivations . How do you begin to think and report on those ?
Well , so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who she says she is . And that this isn ’ t someone in the midst of a heated presidential campaign — that ’ s only , of course , going to get more heated by all expectations — that is trying to push an agenda , or possibly pull a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there in the public . So I really talked to her a lot about her political affiliation . She describes herself as a third-generation Democrat , but walks me through the fact that she liked Marianne Williamson . She really liked Elizabeth Warren . and when California voted in the primary over Super Tuesday , she backed Bernie Sanders . But she insists that her motivation for this is not political , even though I had watched as supporters of Sanders and supporters of President Trump , really , are the ones pushing this allegation out there on social media , and really keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it . So that ’ s one concern . And there is this other unusual detail .
Well , she had written a fair amount in Medium posts and on Twitter about her support for Russia and her respect for Vladimir Putin . And so we read through all those Medium posts . Some of them had been pulled down off the internet , but we found them . We looked through those old Twitter posts , and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some kind of nefarious agenda there . And she says that she was misguided . Tara Reade says that she had been working on a novel — she ’ s not anymore — about Russia , and this was all part of her research . And she says that she doesn ’ t have any respect for Vladimir Putin now , has never been to Russia . So we decide that that ’ s not so disqualifying that it prevents us from putting a version of her story in the paper .
So how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this point ? And I assume , in consultation with your editors , how are you planning to proceed ?
Well , one thing we know is that we can ’ t corroborate her story beyond the two friends and her brother .
We know we can ’ t find any documents , and we know that everyone who worked for Joe Biden is denying that anything like this ever happened , or could have happened .
And we also know one other thing . And this is really important . As far as we ’ ve learned in our reporting , there is no pattern of this kind of behavior from Joe Biden . What we had seen a year ago was a very different thing . It was touching in public , rubbing of shoulders , or maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable . This is an allegation of a sexual assault . Those things are not at all similar . And in fact , what Tara Reade is alleging is a fairly singular act , as far as we know . But the Democratic Party , they ’ ve really set a very high standard for taking these cases seriously , for taking allegations of sexual abuse seriously . Even Joe Biden has taken a strong position on this , and it ’ s worth remembering the Kavanaugh hearings . And one thing that Joe Biden said when that was all going on was this , he said : “ For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus , nationally , you ’ ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she ’ s talking about is real , whether or not she forgets facts , whether or not it ’ s been made worse or better over time . But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron .
That ’ s exactly right . Biden essentially saying , believe women . And I think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that you ’ ve seen from his campaign . Joe Biden himself has not spoken about them at all , and I don ’ t think he ’ s been asked directly , although I suppose that could come . But his campaign has been very careful in all their public statements to say that they believe women , that they think coming out like this is a credible thing to do . But in this case , they say the allegations are false . But they ’ re really walking a tightrope when they talk about this politically , with many in the base of the Democratic Party .
Well , help me understand that . I mean , with all that history in mind that you just described , of the Democratic Party setting such a high standard for itself — and Biden himself , the presumptive Democratic nominee , saying , believe women — how is the Democratic establishment , how is the Democratic Party responding to what Tara Reade has alleged happened to her ?
They ’ re not responding . Nobody in the Democratic establishment , elected officials , party leaders , has discussed this at all .
Why do you think that is ? I mean , is that a function of the conflicting information here ? Is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee ? Is that about the fact that there is just one of these accusations , not a pattern , as you just said ? How do you explain that ?
Well , honestly , I think it ’ s some of all of that . When I talk to people who are close to Joe Biden , and I ’ ve now talked to quite a lot of them , they say that this is something that ’ s just so completely out of character for him . They describe a man who ’ s fiercely devoted to his wife and his kids . That he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he could get the quickest train , the soonest train , home to Delaware so he could see them . And they just can not reconcile these allegations that are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades . So they say they can ’ t believe it ’ s true . But when you look at the political calendar , we ’ re in the spring of an election year , Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee . So you have to figure that many , many Democrats also just don ’ t want this to be true .
archived recording ( bernie sanders ) So today , I am asking all Americans — I ’ m asking every Democrat , I ’ m asking every independent , I ’ m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy , which I endorse .
On Monday , Joe Biden was endorsed by his former rival , Senator Bernie Sanders .
archived recording ( joe biden ) Well , Bernie I want to thank you for that . It ’ s a big deal . I think that your endorsement means a great deal . It means a great deal to me .
We ’ ll be right back . Here ’ s what else you need to know today .
On Monday , France said it would extend a nationwide lockdown until the middle of May . Britain was expected to extend its lockdown . And Russia ’ s president offered his darkest assessment yet of the virus ’ s impact there .
During a meeting with his advisors , Vladimir Putin said , quote , “ We see the situation changing daily . And unfortunately , not for the better . ”
archived recording ( andrew cuomo ) Thank you very much . Good afternoon to everyone . Let me welcome my fellow governors , who are on the telephone , who you ’ ll hear from in a moment .
In the U.S. , two groups of governors — one on the east coast , the other on the west coast — said they would decide regionally when and how to reopen their state ’ s economies , and emphasized that they would not do so until experts and data showed that it would be safe .
archived recording ( andrew cuomo ) Again , we anticipate different facts , different circumstances for different states , different parts of states . But let ’ s be smart and let ’ s be cooperative . And let ’ s learn from one another .
During a conference call , the governors , including Tom Wolfe of Pennsylvania , said that it was their role , not the federal government ’ s , to make that decision .
archived recording ( tom wolfe ) Well , seeing as how had the responsibility for closing the state down , I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up .
A few hours later , President Trump was asked about the governor ’ s announcement .

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: A former Senate aide to Joe Biden has accused him of assaulting her in 1993. My colleague Lisa Lerer examines the allegation. It’s Tuesday, April 14. Lisa, when did you begin reporting this story?

lisa lerer

So about a year ago, we were reporting on allegations from a number of women who came out and said that Joe Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.

archived recording Tonight, Joe Biden is facing troubling accusations. Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched and kissed her head before a rally in 2014.

lisa lerer

Maybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder, maybe he smelled their hair —

archived recording (lucy flores) — out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head.

lisa lerer

But this was all happening in public, at campaign rallies, at fund-raisers.

archived recording 1 He put his hands around my head and pulled me in. archived recording 2 Former congressional aide Amy Lappos told CBS News tonight that Joe Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut in 2009.

lisa lerer

And we in the newsroom and in the media, we’re really grappling with how to think and talk about this behavior. This wasn’t anything like what had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around #MeToo, like Harvey Weinstein or any of that.

archived recording (lucy flores) And for the record, I don’t believe that it was a bad intention. I’m not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. I felt invaded. I felt that there was a violation of my personal space. There was no —

lisa lerer

The women talking about these allegations weren’t quite sure what to call it. Some of them said quite vehemently that they didn’t consider it sexual harassment. But they wanted the former vice president to be aware of his behavior and how it could make people feel. Others had a slightly different perspective. They thought it was something closer to sexual harassment. So this goes on for really a couple weeks. And in the end, Biden — he doesn’t quite apologize.

archived recording (joe biden) Today, I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that I’ve made to women and some men, and it made them uncomfortable.

lisa lerer

But he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has a very touchy feely kind of political style.

archived recording (joe biden) In my career, I’ve always tried to make a human connection. That’s my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say, you can do this.

lisa lerer

But he recognizes that times have changed, and perhaps he needs to change with them and be more respectful of people’s space.

archived recording (joe biden) You know, social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. And I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility. My responsibility. And I’ll meet it.

lisa lerer

And then, I met Tara Reade. And she had called me with sort of similar kind of story. Joe Biden had touched her, he’d put his hands in her hair, he touched her shoulders, all in public, in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable. But her story had a little bit of a different twist. So she, at the time, had been working in his Senate office. And this was about — I think December 1992 to August 1993. She was a low-level staffer, a staff assistant. And she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and squeezes of the shoulder. That there had been harassment.

michael barbaro

Hm.

lisa lerer

She says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party. He had commented on her looks in the office, in front of other people. And that she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered and permitted this kind of sexual harassment.

michael barbaro

And what did you do with Reade’s story, with that reporting?

lisa lerer

Well, I talked to her. I talked to her friend, who corroborated a lot of what she was telling me. We did use her allegations to call a whole bunch of people who had worked in Joe Biden’s office in the 1990s — particularly the early 1990s, which was the period that Tara Reade was working there — to see if they remembered any kind of harassment, what the environment of the office was at the time. But we didn’t really come up with anything all that surprising or explosive. Nobody really confirmed her account at that time. So we actually didn’t end up reporting them in the paper. We had already reported on a number of allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with Joe Biden’s touching. And we just sort of moved on. And the political world did too. Everyone moved on to the next battle. There was the Mueller report to contend with, and then a really competitive primary, presidential debates started. So this issue of the unwanted touching and Tara’s story just never came back up.

michael barbaro

Mm hmm. And Lisa, do you think that has something to do with the fact that Biden confronted this, talked about it and said he was learning from it?

lisa lerer

Oh, for sure. But he was really forced into confronting it. I mean, this was a period in March, in April, before Biden had formally announced his presidential bid, where he was going through the process of reconciling a lot of his record with the current mores of the Democratic Party. He was dealing with his criminal justice record, he was dealing with his positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party. And so I think that quasi-apology video was part of that process. You have a Democratic Party that’s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender bias, and Biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms — whether he felt they were fair or not — with where the party was. But ultimately, he didn’t pay much of a price for it. He announced his campaign a couple three or so weeks later. His opponents never made an issue of this and everything sort of moved on.

michael barbaro

OK, so what happens next?

lisa lerer

Well, you have the primary race. So Biden, as we all know, nosedives. Then he comes back up, he becomes the front-runner. And around that time —

archived recording (katie halper) Hello, and welcome to the Katie Halper Show.

lisa lerer

A woman goes on a podcast —

archived recording (katie halper) Where would you like to start? Where does the story start for you? archived recording (tara reade) Well, the story starts when I went to work for Joe Biden.

lisa lerer

And levels a really serious, serious accusation against Joe Biden, which is basically that he sexually assaulted her.

archived recording (tara reade) And my body — I was shaking everywhere, because it was cold all of a sudden, and I was — I don’t know, I feel like I was shaking, just everywhere. And I was trying to grasp what had just happened, and what I should do.

lisa lerer

And that woman, who tells her story in great detail on this podcast, is Tara Reade.

michael barbaro

So what are you thinking at this point? Because you had already talked to this woman, and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation, right?

lisa lerer

Well, I must admit, I’m a little confused, because it didn’t come up at all. And so the first thing I did was pull up my notes. And when I look over my notes and I read the story she had told me a year ago, there’s some holes in that story she told me. Things I remember thinking that her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was experiencing in the office at the time. That maybe make a little more sense if this other thing had in fact happened — this sexual assault. So I wondered, first of all, had she been truthful the first time around? Was she being truthful now? And also, whether I had asked the right questions. Did I miss something because I hadn’t called back, because I got caught up with the dynamics of this primary?

michael barbaro

So at this point — after Tara Reade has gone on this podcast, she has made this claim, and you’re trying to figure out why she didn’t first tell you that same information — how are you now approaching this story, journalistically?

lisa lerer

So I think we all quickly agreed that it wasn’t a question of whether we would approach the story, but how. This was a woman who was making very serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached, publicly, against the man who is more than likely to become the Democratic nominee for president. So we had to grapple with these claims. The question was, how? And I think the natural thing to do — really, the human thing to do — is to go into a story like this and say, do you believe or not believe the person who’s making the accusation? But that’s not the journalistic thing to do. We’re not judges, we’re not the jury, we’re not the police department. I was really focused on what we could show to be true and what we could show to not be true. What we had corroboration on, and what we didn’t have corroboration on. And what kind of facts we could give voters and the American public about this whole incident, that’s already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on social media. People knew about it.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

But they didn’t know the details, and they didn’t really know what was true or not.

michael barbaro

And so where do you begin as you’re trying to figure this all out?

lisa lerer

Well, so the main thing I needed to do was get Tara Reade back on the phone. So that’s where I began.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Lisa, tell me about this, I guess, second round of communications that you have with Tara Reade, after she claims that Joe Biden has assaulted her.

lisa lerer

So I call her, and we start talking every day. And the obvious first question I ask her is why she didn’t tell me about these allegations when we talked a year ago. And she tells me that even though they weren’t published in The New York Times, they were published in a local paper. And the feedback she got from that being out there, the kind of death threats and harassment online, made her reluctant to tell the rest of her story. So we talk through all that, and then eventually, I say to her that I need her to tell me the story that she told on that podcast in a way that we can use on the record. And I start recording her.

interposing voices Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Yep, I got you.

michael barbaro

And what does she say?

lisa lerer So where do you want to start? tara reade OK. So let’s start with the assault.

lisa lerer

So the story that I’m about to tell you is all according to Tara Reade. So it’s 1993, in the spring some time, and she’s working as a staff assistant in Joe Biden’s Senate office. And one day, she’s at work, and her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag — this gym bag — and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym bag.

tara reade She just said, take him his gym bag, hurry! And she was like, he’ll meet you, he’s down towards the Capitol.

lisa lerer

So she heads down and finds him somewhere in the Capitol complex of offices.

tara reade And I ran into him, like I saw him, and I — he acknowledged me, he was talking to someone, they walked away. And then he said, come here, Tara. And then he smiled at me, greeted me.

lisa lerer

And she says, hello, Senator.

tara reade I called him “Senator.” I didn’t call him “Joe.” And I handed him the bag with my right hand, I remember that.

lisa lerer

And the next thing she remembers, he’s pinned her up against a wall, which she remembers as being very, very cold. And he’s kissing her.

tara reade It happened at once, and that’s what’s so hard about telling this story. Like he’s talking to me, and his hands are everywhere, and everything’s happening at once very quickly. This happened, like, in under two minutes.

lisa lerer

And according to Tara, he reaches his hand under her shirt — she remembers she was wearing a cream-colored blouse — grabs her left breast.

tara reade He used his knee to part my knees, because my legs went together. And he went kind of down my skirt, and then as he’s parting my legs with his knee, he like went up, and then just went under. And then, of course, yeah, he was able to do what he did, which was he took — it felt like one or two fingers, and inserted them in my vagina.

lisa lerer

And at that point, he’s kissing her and he says to her, she says, do you want to go somewhere else? And he tried — she said — to kiss her on the mouth, but she moves her head.

tara reade And then he pulled back, because I wasn’t responding to him, I wasn’t kissing him back. I completely froze up, and he had kind of lifted me up, so I was like up on my tippy toes almost. And then he looked back and he looked at me —

lisa lerer

And he looks at her, and he says, according to her —

tara reade Come on, man. I heard you liked me. Then he smiled, but then when I looked at his eyes, he was angry. Like there —

lisa lerer

And she said she remembers standing there, just kind of frozen, and she felt almost a little bad, like she had put him in a bad position. And she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be interested in this. And according to Tara, he looked her and he said —

tara reade He pointed his finger at me and he just goes, you’re — you’re nothing to me. And then he looked at me, and he goes, nothing.

lisa lerer

You’re nothing to me. Nothing. And she thinks she must have looked a certain way or had a certain expression in her eye, because then he kind of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders, and said, you’re OK, you’re fine. And he kind of almost set her down, she said, and then he walked off and walked down the hall.

tara reade I know I went to the restroom, I know I did, to clean up. But I don’t remember which restroom I went to in the Russell Building or there — I don’t know. But I know I did. But my vivid memory next is sitting — I was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at the Russell Building with those big windows. I remember just sitting on the stairs, and nobody was there. And just like my whole body was literally — I couldn’t control my shaking. I remember just being so cold. So cold.

lisa lerer

And then she headed home. She doesn’t remember how she got there. She doesn’t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag or talked to anybody. But she made it home to her apartment.

tara reade The next thing I remember is being on the phone with my mom and crying and then arguing with her.

lisa lerer

And her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to immediately file a police report.

tara reade You know, she even swore at me. She was not being gentle and supportive, and I understand, because she wanted me to have evidence. And now I understand what she was trying to do, and I didn’t then.

lisa lerer

But Tara doesn’t do that.

michael barbaro

And does she say why she did not go to the police?

lisa lerer

Well, what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to go away, is what she told me. That after it happened, she took a shower. She says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time.

tara reade I threw everything out. Even the shoes. Everything. Like, I just — that’s how I felt about it. lisa lerer Really? What kind of —

lisa lerer

She tells me that she called in sick to work, that she was sobbing uncontrollably.

tara reade It’s like I just didn’t want it to have happened. It just didn’t happen.

michael barbaro

And what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after this alleged incident?

lisa lerer

So she tells me eventually she does go back to work. And when she does, she says that she tells her immediate supervisor, who’s Biden’s personal secretary, as well as two top staffers in the office — the deputy chief of staff and the chief of staff — that she feels uncomfortable around Joe Biden. She never mentions the alleged assault, but she talks more about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling his hands in her hair. And in her telling, the staff don’t really do anything about that. In fact, she feels that they kind of penalize her for bringing that forward. She says they strip her of one of her duties, which is supervising the interns. She says they put her in a windowless office, far from the rest of the staff. So at some point, she says that she goes to a Senate personnel office and files a formal complaint.

michael barbaro

And what does she say was in this complaint?

lisa lerer

She said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw as retaliation in the office. But she believes that that forum eventually was returned to Biden’s office, which would have been a flouting of what the official protocol was at that time. And once that complaint was returned to Biden’s office, she says, she was given a month to find a new job, and basically eased out of her position. And so she started looking for another position on Capitol Hill, she says, and never ended up getting hired or finding anything.

michael barbaro

So Lisa, once Tara Reade has given you this account of an alleged attack, what do you do next?

lisa lerer

So at this point, she’s told me a lot of information. And some really detailed information too. So I start thinking about what can be corroborated, what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not true. And one thing that Tara mentions to me is that at the time, she had called a friend and told her the whole story. So I tracked down the friend.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And in large part, she corroborates the story that Tara had told me. Tara tells me she also told her mother. Her mother is deceased, so she can’t be called. And she told a version of her story to her brother, though not all the details. So I start trying to track down her brother. And she tells me she told a friend in 2008, after Joe Biden had been picked as Barack Obama’s vice president. She had told a version of this story to that friend, without all the details, but that something had happened to her. So I tracked down that friend, and she confirms that account and some of the things that Tara tells me.

michael barbaro

Where does that leave you?

lisa lerer

So it leaves us with something, but certainly not enough to corroborate this entire story. We really only have the one friend with the full story, and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces. So that’s not the kind of full corroboration that you’re looking for as a journalist, when you’re trying to confirm really serious allegations and also really politically explosive allegations. But at this point, it’s time to turn to the Biden side of things. So along with my colleague Sydney Ember, we start looking at who we can talk to. And we start by calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that Tara had mentioned she had spoken with, and she had raised those complaints of harassment to. All three of them say that a woman named Tara Reade never approached them with these kind of allegations, and two of them said they didn’t remember her at all even working in the office.

michael barbaro

So just to be clear, the three people that Tara Reade said she went to and told of Biden’s behavior that made her uncomfortable, pretty senior people in his office, they say they have no recollection of that ever happening?

lisa lerer

Exactly. They have no recollection. And a lot of the former staffers are mystified by her account too. They don’t remember anything like this, or even the hint of anything like this. So they — when Sydney and I call them, they’re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they remember from working in that office. A lot of them didn’t want to talk on the record. One who did said that at the time, you knew who the good guys and bad guys were on the Senate. The places where — offices where women would and would not want to work, and she described Biden as one of the good guys.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

So after that, we reached out to another group of people, which is the interns. And that’s because Tara had told me that she supervised the interns, and that she shared an office with these interns. So I reached two of them, and they both tell me that they’d never heard of anything, never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault Tara had been alleging. But that they did remember midway through their internship, sometime in April, she had been suddenly removed as their boss. And they never knew why, and they never saw her again. So amid all this confusion, I remember that there’s one thing that really could cut through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And that’s this complaint that Tara had told me she filed in 1993 with the Senate office —

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa lerer

— and that someone had written down. So we start trying to track down that complaint. And we call the Federal Office of Personnel Management, and they tell us to file a Freedom of Information request, which would take months, if not years. And anyhow, we don’t really know exactly what we’re asking for, because she doesn’t remember the name of the office where she filed this complaint.

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa lerer

We call over to the Senate and we’re able to get some employment records, but not this complaint. So we basically look for this document and come up empty. It’s unfindable in the end.

michael barbaro

What about other aspects of Reade’s life that might feel relevant? I mean, possible political affiliations or motivations. How do you begin to think and report on those?

lisa lerer

Well, so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who she says she is. And that this isn’t someone in the midst of a heated presidential campaign — that’s only, of course, going to get more heated by all expectations — that is trying to push an agenda, or possibly pull a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there in the public. So I really talked to her a lot about her political affiliation. She describes herself as a third-generation Democrat, but walks me through the fact that she liked Marianne Williamson. She really liked Elizabeth Warren. and when California voted in the primary over Super Tuesday, she backed Bernie Sanders. But she insists that her motivation for this is not political, even though I had watched as supporters of Sanders and supporters of President Trump, really, are the ones pushing this allegation out there on social media, and really keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it. So that’s one concern. And there is this other unusual detail.

michael barbaro

Which is what?

lisa lerer

Well, she had written a fair amount in Medium posts and on Twitter about her support for Russia and her respect for Vladimir Putin. And so we read through all those Medium posts. Some of them had been pulled down off the internet, but we found them. We looked through those old Twitter posts, and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some kind of nefarious agenda there. And she says that she was misguided. Tara Reade says that she had been working on a novel — she’s not anymore — about Russia, and this was all part of her research. And she says that she doesn’t have any respect for Vladimir Putin now, has never been to Russia. So we decide that that’s not so disqualifying that it prevents us from putting a version of her story in the paper.

michael barbaro

So how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this point? And I assume, in consultation with your editors, how are you planning to proceed?

lisa lerer

Well, one thing we know is that we can’t corroborate her story beyond the two friends and her brother.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

We know we can’t find any documents, and we know that everyone who worked for Joe Biden is denying that anything like this ever happened, or could have happened.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And we also know one other thing. And this is really important. As far as we’ve learned in our reporting, there is no pattern of this kind of behavior from Joe Biden. What we had seen a year ago was a very different thing. It was touching in public, rubbing of shoulders, or maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable. This is an allegation of a sexual assault. Those things are not at all similar. And in fact, what Tara Reade is alleging is a fairly singular act, as far as we know. But the Democratic Party, they’ve really set a very high standard for taking these cases seriously, for taking allegations of sexual abuse seriously. Even Joe Biden has taken a strong position on this, and it’s worth remembering the Kavanaugh hearings. And one thing that Joe Biden said when that was all going on was this, he said: “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time. But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.

michael barbaro

So it’s Biden himself saying, essentially, believe women.

lisa lerer

That’s exactly right. Biden essentially saying, believe women. And I think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that you’ve seen from his campaign. Joe Biden himself has not spoken about them at all, and I don’t think he’s been asked directly, although I suppose that could come. But his campaign has been very careful in all their public statements to say that they believe women, that they think coming out like this is a credible thing to do. But in this case, they say the allegations are false. But they’re really walking a tightrope when they talk about this politically, with many in the base of the Democratic Party.

michael barbaro

Well, help me understand that. I mean, with all that history in mind that you just described, of the Democratic Party setting such a high standard for itself — and Biden himself, the presumptive Democratic nominee, saying, believe women — how is the Democratic establishment, how is the Democratic Party responding to what Tara Reade has alleged happened to her?

lisa lerer

They’re not responding. Nobody in the Democratic establishment, elected officials, party leaders, has discussed this at all.

michael barbaro

Why do you think that is? I mean, is that a function of the conflicting information here? Is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee? Is that about the fact that there is just one of these accusations, not a pattern, as you just said? How do you explain that?

lisa lerer

Well, honestly, I think it’s some of all of that. When I talk to people who are close to Joe Biden, and I’ve now talked to quite a lot of them, they say that this is something that’s just so completely out of character for him. They describe a man who’s fiercely devoted to his wife and his kids. That he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he could get the quickest train, the soonest train, home to Delaware so he could see them. And they just cannot reconcile these allegations that are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades. So they say they can’t believe it’s true. But when you look at the political calendar, we’re in the spring of an election year, Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. So you have to figure that many, many Democrats also just don’t want this to be true.

Intel learned of Mr. Krzanich ’ s relationship in the past week from an employee who raised concerns , according to people familiar with the matter . The company said an investigation by internal and external counsel into what it called “ a past consensual relationship ” confirmed a violation of its nonfraternization policy , which was put into place in 2011 and applies to all managers .
The company , which said the investigation is continuing , accepted Mr. Krzanich ’ s resignation Wednesday . Mr. Krzanich , who was CEO since 2013 , couldn ’ t be reached for comment .
Robert Swan , the company ’ s chief financial officer , was named interim CEO .
Decades ago , board members were more likely to look the other way on office romances and other personal matters , but the CEO role today is more high-profile than ever , limiting the room for transgressions , said executive recruiters and corporate-governance experts .
The rise of the # MeToo movement has companies hewing closely to policies on both sexual harassment and consensual relationships , especially for business leaders , said Davia Temin , chief executive of Temin & Co. , a Manhattan-based reputation and crisis-management firm .
“ There ’ s a new level of rigor that says if something is on the books , it needs to be upheld and not ignored , ” she said , adding that boards are increasingly concerned about a company ’ s reputation .
Relationship rules at U.S. companies vary . Some companies ban senior managers from dating anybody further down the chain of hierarchy within the company , while others ask for co-workers to disclose their relationships . Many companies have no employee dating policy at all .
At many major companies , employment contracts for CEOs explicitly prohibit romantic relationships with employees , or give boards wide latitude to fire a chief for any behavior considered unethical , said Jason Hanold , head of executive-search firm Hanold Associates .
Though such language has been a feature of C-suite contracts for decades , boards have become more sensitive to improper behavior—past or present—in the # MeToo era , he said .
“ Today it ’ s a well-known expectation that comes with the CEO role , ” Mr. Hanold said . “ To have a relationship with anyone in your organization , you ’ re doing so knowing all of the risks . ”
Intel prohibits managers from having sexual or romantic relationships with direct or indirect reports , a spokesman said . The policy is a “ hard ban ” that applies to all managers regardless of seniority and requires employees to raise any concerns immediately , he said .
Intel held a companywide video call from its Santa Clara office at 11 a.m. local time , where Andy Bryant , the company ’ s chairman , and Mr. Swan answered questions , according to an employee who watched the webcast meeting . During the call , Mr. Swan said he wasn ’ t interested in staying on as the permanent CEO , the employee said .
Executives declined to answer employee questions about the relationship that led to Mr. Krzanich ’ s resignation , saying they wanted to protect the privacy of the Krzanich family and the person involved , according to the employee .
“ The general feeling is one of disappointment , ” the employee said . Intel goes out of its way “ to make sure we understand what the rules are and that we follow them . To have the leader of the company violate these rules is disappointing . ”
Intel declined to comment on its internal communications related to the resignation .
Mr. Krzanich joins other CEOs who left following allegations of relationships with employees , including Harry Stonecipher , who left as CEO of Boeing Co. in 2005 ; Steven Heyer , who left Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2007 ; and Christopher Kubasik , who was the CEO-in-waiting when he left Lockheed Martin in 2012 . Mr. Stonecipher said at the time that he “ used poor judgment. ” Mr. Heyer denied any impropriety . And Mr. Kubasik said he regretted his conduct “ did not meet the standards to which I have always held myself . ”
Mr. Krzanich started at Intel in 1982 , rising through a series of technical and leadership roles to become chief executive in 2013 . He set about a broad effort to diversify the company ’ s offerings beyond processor chips for personal computers , a market in which Intel holds a more than 90 % share , according to Mercury Research , leaving it scant room to grow as PC shipments decline .
Mr. Krzanich received $ 21.5 million in compensation in 2017 , including stock awards and other incentive pay , up 13 % from the previous year , according to a regulatory filing . Intel noted that Mr. Krzanich would have been eligible for $ 38 million had he left the company last year by voluntary termination or retirement . Intel didn ’ t immediately say whether Mr. Krzanich would receive that compensation now .
His resignation marked a sudden turn for the tech giant as it seeks to extend its dominance in personal-computer chips into new frontiers in computing such as advanced automotive technologies and artificial intelligence .
It comes at a transformative time for Intel , which under him swallowed its two biggest acquisitions—a $ 16.7 billion deal for Altera Corp. in 2015 and $ 15.3 billion for Mobileye NV a year later—as it tries to branch out beyond its PC and server-chip strongholds and fend off rising threats from rivals such graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp .
Along with announcing Mr. Krzanich ’ s departure , Intel released a financial forecast that was above analysts ’ expectations . For the current second quarter , Intel expects adjusted earnings of 99 cents a share and revenue of $ 16.9 billion . Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 86 cents a share and revenue of $ 16.3 billion .
Intel shares finished New York trading down 2.4 % at $ 52.19 .

The company, which said the investigation is continuing, accepted Mr. Krzanich’s resignation Wednesday. Mr. Krzanich, who was CEO since 2013, couldn’t be reached for comment.

Robert Swan, the company’s chief financial officer, was named interim CEO.

Decades ago, board members were more likely to look the other way on office romances and other personal matters, but the CEO role today is more high-profile than ever, limiting the room for transgressions, said executive recruiters and corporate-governance experts.

The rise of the #MeToo movement has companies hewing closely to policies on both sexual harassment and consensual relationships, especially for business leaders, said Davia Temin, chief executive of Temin & Co., a Manhattan-based reputation and crisis-management firm.

“There’s a new level of rigor that says if something is on the books, it needs to be upheld and not ignored,” she said, adding that boards are increasingly concerned about a company’s reputation.

Relationship rules at U.S. companies vary. Some companies ban senior managers from dating anybody further down the chain of hierarchy within the company, while others ask for co-workers to disclose their relationships. Many companies have no employee dating policy at all.

At many major companies, employment contracts for CEOs explicitly prohibit romantic relationships with employees, or give boards wide latitude to fire a chief for any behavior considered unethical, said Jason Hanold, head of executive-search firm Hanold Associates.

Though such language has been a feature of C-suite contracts for decades, boards have become more sensitive to improper behavior—past or present—in the #MeToo era, he said.

“Today it’s a well-known expectation that comes with the CEO role,” Mr. Hanold said. “To have a relationship with anyone in your organization, you’re doing so knowing all of the risks.”

Intel prohibits managers from having sexual or romantic relationships with direct or indirect reports, a spokesman said. The policy is a “hard ban” that applies to all managers regardless of seniority and requires employees to raise any concerns immediately, he said.

Intel held a companywide video call from its Santa Clara office at 11 a.m. local time, where Andy Bryant, the company’s chairman, and Mr. Swan answered questions, according to an employee who watched the webcast meeting. During the call, Mr. Swan said he wasn’t interested in staying on as the permanent CEO, the employee said.

Executives declined to answer employee questions about the relationship that led to Mr. Krzanich’s resignation, saying they wanted to protect the privacy of the Krzanich family and the person involved, according to the employee.

“The general feeling is one of disappointment,” the employee said. Intel goes out of its way “to make sure we understand what the rules are and that we follow them. To have the leader of the company violate these rules is disappointing.”

Intel declined to comment on its internal communications related to the resignation.

Mr. Krzanich joins other CEOs who left following allegations of relationships with employees, including Harry Stonecipher, who left as CEO of Boeing Co. in 2005; Steven Heyer, who left Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2007; and Christopher Kubasik, who was the CEO-in-waiting when he left Lockheed Martin in 2012. Mr. Stonecipher said at the time that he “used poor judgment.” Mr. Heyer denied any impropriety. And Mr. Kubasik said he regretted his conduct “did not meet the standards to which I have always held myself.”

Mr. Krzanich started at Intel in 1982, rising through a series of technical and leadership roles to become chief executive in 2013. He set about a broad effort to diversify the company’s offerings beyond processor chips for personal computers, a market in which Intel holds a more than 90% share, according to Mercury Research, leaving it scant room to grow as PC shipments decline.

Mr. Krzanich received $21.5 million in compensation in 2017, including stock awards and other incentive pay, up 13% from the previous year, according to a regulatory filing. Intel noted that Mr. Krzanich would have been eligible for $38 million had he left the company last year by voluntary termination or retirement. Intel didn’t immediately say whether Mr. Krzanich would receive that compensation now.

His resignation marked a sudden turn for the tech giant as it seeks to extend its dominance in personal-computer chips into new frontiers in computing such as advanced automotive technologies and artificial intelligence.

It comes at a transformative time for Intel, which under him swallowed its two biggest acquisitions—a $16.7 billion deal for Altera Corp. in 2015 and $15.3 billion for Mobileye NV a year later—as it tries to branch out beyond its PC and server-chip strongholds and fend off rising threats from rivals such graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp.

Along with announcing Mr. Krzanich’s departure, Intel released a financial forecast that was above analysts’ expectations. For the current second quarter, Intel expects adjusted earnings of 99 cents a share and revenue of $16.9 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 86 cents a share and revenue of $16.3 billion.

Intel shares finished New York trading down 2.4% at $52.19.

sexual_misconduct,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49755850,Chanel Miller: Stanford sexual assault survivor tells her story,,"Lauren Turner, San Francisco","What do we know about Emily Doe ? We know she was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner outside a frat party at Stanford University , California , one night in January 2015 . She was found unconscious and partly-clothed , near a dumpster .
He would get a six-month term , for sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim , sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her .
He would serve three months and be put on probation for three years , ending this month . Judge Aaron Persky , who was later removed from his post , cited Turner 's good character and the fact he had been drinking .
Much of the coverage at the time also focused on the fact Turner was a star swimmer .
What do we know about Chanel Miller ? Maybe you do n't know a lot , yet . If you 've read the victim impact statement she addressed to Turner , which went viral when she was still known as Emily Doe to protect her anonymity , you 'll know she is brave and articulate .
She is a literature graduate , who has now written a book , Know My Name . She is a talented artist and would love to illustrate children 's books , her drawings being a little surreal and - by her own description - sinister . She has also studied ceramics and comic books , and done stand-up comedy .
She loves dogs . She describes herself as shy . She is half-Chinese , her Chinese name being Zhang Xiao Xia ( with Xia sounding like `` sha '' , the first syllable of Chanel ) . She smiles easily , is thoughtful and funny . She is someone 's daughter , sister , girlfriend . She could be someone you know .
Warning : This story contains content that readers may find distressing
Chanel 's memoir brims with the rage of her ordeal . But why write it , when it meant reliving her pain , reading the court documents and witness statements that had been - until then - kept from her ?
She says she felt a duty to shine a light on the darkness so many young women have to go through .
`` I 've had days where it 's extremely difficult to get up in the morning , '' says Chanel , 27 , speaking in her home city of San Francisco . `` I 've had days where I really could not imagine a single pathway forward . And those were such weighing times .
`` And it was terrible . I would n't draw anything , I would n't write anything . All I wanted to do is sleep so that I would n't have to be conscious . That 's no way to live .
`` I think of other young women who have to go through this and you see them withdraw and crumble and fall away from the things that they love . And I just think - how , how do we let that happen ? ''
Her voice is articulate and clear but it vibrates with emotion , and quiet fury , at the injustice of this happening to other women around the world . An endless parade of other people who know what it is to be Emily Doe .
`` Here are these young , talented women excited for their futures , who have so many things to give and offer . And something like this happens , '' says Chanel . `` And they go home , and they carry the shame , and they swallow it up and it eats them from the inside out .
`` And they think 'everything would be better off if I was just holed up in my room ' , 'maybe things would be better if I did n't speak at all ' . 'Maybe I do n't deserve to be loved or caressed gently ' .
`` It 's so sick , that we let this happen . That we let them digest these negative ideas of themselves . And let them be isolated . Instead of coaxing them back out here and saying , no , you deserve a full life . You deserve an amazing future . ''
Chanel was n't a university student at the time - she had already graduated . Her younger sister Tiffany was back home for the weekend and had asked if she wanted to go along to a party with her .
But her story expanded the conversation about campus rape and she wants to see changes at Stanford University specifically , like the fact forensic exams ca n't be given at Stanford hospital , with victims having to travel 40 miles .
`` Do you get an Uber for 40 minutes with a stranger while you 're still in the clothes you were just attacked in ? Do you text your one friend who has a car and disclose that information ? ''
Many women came forward after reading Chanel 's victim impact statement , emboldened to tell their own stories - in some cases for the first time .
RAINN - the rape , abuse and incest national network , the largest anti-sexual violence organisation in the US - puts the figure at one in six US women being the victim of an attempted , or completed , rape . Every 92 seconds , an American is sexually assaulted . Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults , 995 perpetrators will walk free .
Think of how many women you walk past each day . Think of one in every six .
`` We always say like , oh , why did n't she come forward ? Why did n't she report ? '' says Chanel .
`` Because there 's no system for her to report to . Why should she have faith in us to take care of her if she comes forward ? We need to be doing more to help survivors after this happens . ''
When Turner was sentenced , the crime was not described as rape - but the law in California has since changed , as a result of Chanel 's case .
There is now a mandatory three year minimum prison sentence for penetrating an unconscious person or an intoxicated person , Chanel 's attorney Alaleh Kianerci explains . Another piece of legislation was written to expand the definition of rape to include any kind of penetration ( `` The trauma experienced by survivors can not be measured by what exactly was put inside them without their consent , '' she argued , in her support of the bill ) .
She had felt so beaten down by the court case ( `` I just felt degraded and empty all the time , '' she says ) and the shock of Turner 's sentence that when her lawyer asked her permission to release her victim impact statement , she just said `` sure , if you think it 'd be helpful '' . She thought it would end up on a community forum or local newspaper website - never imagining the impact it would have .
When her statement came out , originally published in full on Buzzfeed , it received 11 million views in four days and Chanel was sent hundreds and hundreds of letters and gifts from around the world .
She read them all , saying they `` taught me to be gentler to myself , taught me who I was to them '' , adding : `` I was learning to see myself through them . ''
She even got a letter from the White House - Joe Biden , then vice-president , telling her : `` You have given them the strength they need to fight . And so , I believe , you will save lives . ''
As she was anonymous , it was common for friends to forward the statement to her , unaware she had written it . Chanel 's therapist knew she had been sexually assaulted but did not know her identity as Emily Doe for months , asking her : `` Have you read the Stanford victim statement ? ''
Courts hear from cases like Chanel 's all the time - it 's just the names , the places , the details change . So what made her story , her pain , resonate so widely ?
`` Maybe not shying away from the darkest parts , '' Chanel says . `` I think it feels almost like a relief when someone acknowledges your darkness because you feel like it 's this ugly , dirty thing you need to be concealing .
`` If you show it , people are going to cringe and back away . I could communicate all of these difficult feelings and be open about them and just lay them out and not feel shame for experiencing them . ''
Having been through the court system , Chanel said she felt she had a responsibility to report back , to show others what it is like .
`` I know that for me , I had so many , quote unquote , advantages , '' she says . `` I had my rape kit done [ a sexual assault forensic evidence kit ] . I had the assistance of policemen and nurses . I had an advocate that was assigned to me , I had a prosecutor , I had all the things you 're supposed to have .
`` And I still found it so excruciatingly difficult and emotionally damaging and going through it . I thought , 'if this is what it looks like , to be well equipped going into this , how the hell is anyone else supposed to survive this process ? ' .
`` I felt that I had a duty to write about what it 's like inside the windowless walls of a courtroom , what the internal landscape is like , what it 's like to sit on that stand and be attacked with this meaningless interrogation . ''
Writing the book also allowed her access to the court documents and thousands of pages of transcripts she had not been present for .
While elucidating , it was also deeply painful , knowing what not just the court - but her family and friends had heard and seen .
`` It was extremely difficult . I put it off for a really long time . Finally , I thought well , I have to look into them .
`` I would read about Brock and the defence talking about , play by play , taking off my underwear , putting his fingers inside… , '' she stops , before adding : `` It was so graphic and suffocating , to read about myself being verbally undressed again .
`` And to imagine it all happening in a courtroom where everyone 's just listening and nobody 's doing anything . I could not stomach it . ''
It caused her anger and `` self-induced depression '' but says there was `` this wonderful moment where I 'm like , all of these voices in these transcripts are literally in my hands , I can pick them up and put them down . But I own all of them . I get to pick out whichever words I want and assemble them how I want '' .
`` There is a lot of power in being able to craft the narrative again , '' she adds .
Know My Name brims with the trauma Chanel experienced - from waking up not knowing what had happened , to learning details of the assault from news reports , to finally telling her parents , to breaking down in court . As she says , `` writing is the way I process the world '' .
Chanel only chose to reveal her name six months ago , having started writing the book in 2017 .
She says the burden of secrecy had become too much for her - 90 % of people who knew her did n't know her other identity .
Friends thought she was still doing her 9-5 office job . So she had former colleagues ( `` my suppliers '' , she smiles ) feed her snippets of information . `` In the beginning that was so important for self-preservation and processing and privacy , '' she says . `` But over time , you feel really diminished . And I think it 's important to be able to live my full truth . ''
She expected the day , earlier this month , when she came out as Chanel to be `` stormy '' . But it was , in the end , a moment of deep calm and strength .
`` It turned out to be the most peaceful day I 've had in the last four-and-a-half years , '' says Chanel . `` I suddenly realised , I 've come out on the other side of this . ''
She does n't feel Turner - who denied all of the charges - has acknowledged what he did .
`` You know , at the sentencing , he read 10 sentences of apology , '' she says . `` It sounded generic to me .
`` And it really made me question what we 're doing in the criminal justice system , because if he 's not even learning , then really what is the point ? If he had transformed himself , then I think I would have been much more forgiving of the sentence .
`` I am really interested in self-growth and understanding that the fact that he deviated so far from that , and was never forced to do any kind of introspection , or to really look at the way he affected me , that really hurt . ''

Know My Name is published in the US and the UK on 24 September","What do we know about Emily Doe? We know she was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner outside a frat party at Stanford University, California, one night in January 2015. She was found unconscious and partly-clothed, near a dumpster.

He would get a six-month term, for sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her.

He would serve three months and be put on probation for three years, ending this month. Judge Aaron Persky, who was later removed from his post, cited Turner's good character and the fact he had been drinking.

Much of the coverage at the time also focused on the fact Turner was a star swimmer.

What do we know about Chanel Miller? Maybe you don't know a lot, yet. If you've read the victim impact statement she addressed to Turner, which went viral when she was still known as Emily Doe to protect her anonymity, you'll know she is brave and articulate.

Here is what you should know about Chanel.

She is a literature graduate, who has now written a book, Know My Name. She is a talented artist and would love to illustrate children's books, her drawings being a little surreal and - by her own description - sinister. She has also studied ceramics and comic books, and done stand-up comedy.

She loves dogs. She describes herself as shy. She is half-Chinese, her Chinese name being Zhang Xiao Xia (with Xia sounding like ""sha"", the first syllable of Chanel). She smiles easily, is thoughtful and funny. She is someone's daughter, sister, girlfriend. She could be someone you know.

Warning: This story contains content that readers may find distressing

Chanel's memoir brims with the rage of her ordeal. But why write it, when it meant reliving her pain, reading the court documents and witness statements that had been - until then - kept from her?

She says she felt a duty to shine a light on the darkness so many young women have to go through.

""I've had days where it's extremely difficult to get up in the morning,"" says Chanel, 27, speaking in her home city of San Francisco. ""I've had days where I really could not imagine a single pathway forward. And those were such weighing times.

""And it was terrible. I wouldn't draw anything, I wouldn't write anything. All I wanted to do is sleep so that I wouldn't have to be conscious. That's no way to live.

""I think of other young women who have to go through this and you see them withdraw and crumble and fall away from the things that they love. And I just think - how, how do we let that happen?""

Her voice is articulate and clear but it vibrates with emotion, and quiet fury, at the injustice of this happening to other women around the world. An endless parade of other people who know what it is to be Emily Doe.

""Here are these young, talented women excited for their futures, who have so many things to give and offer. And something like this happens,"" says Chanel. ""And they go home, and they carry the shame, and they swallow it up and it eats them from the inside out.

""And they think 'everything would be better off if I was just holed up in my room', 'maybe things would be better if I didn't speak at all'. 'Maybe I don't deserve to be loved or caressed gently'.

""It's so sick, that we let this happen. That we let them digest these negative ideas of themselves. And let them be isolated. Instead of coaxing them back out here and saying, no, you deserve a full life. You deserve an amazing future.""

Chanel wasn't a university student at the time - she had already graduated. Her younger sister Tiffany was back home for the weekend and had asked if she wanted to go along to a party with her.

But her story expanded the conversation about campus rape and she wants to see changes at Stanford University specifically, like the fact forensic exams can't be given at Stanford hospital, with victims having to travel 40 miles.

""Do you get an Uber for 40 minutes with a stranger while you're still in the clothes you were just attacked in? Do you text your one friend who has a car and disclose that information?""

Many women came forward after reading Chanel's victim impact statement, emboldened to tell their own stories - in some cases for the first time.

RAINN - the rape, abuse and incest national network, the largest anti-sexual violence organisation in the US - puts the figure at one in six US women being the victim of an attempted, or completed, rape. Every 92 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 995 perpetrators will walk free.

Think of how many women you walk past each day. Think of one in every six.

""We always say like, oh, why didn't she come forward? Why didn't she report?"" says Chanel.

""Because there's no system for her to report to. Why should she have faith in us to take care of her if she comes forward? We need to be doing more to help survivors after this happens.""

When Turner was sentenced, the crime was not described as rape - but the law in California has since changed, as a result of Chanel's case.

There is now a mandatory three year minimum prison sentence for penetrating an unconscious person or an intoxicated person, Chanel's attorney Alaleh Kianerci explains.

sexual_misconduct,Al Jazeera,0,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/pakistan-kasur-child-rapes-killings-continue-unabated-191028193228404.html,"In Pakistan's Kasur, child rapes and killings continue unabated",,Zehra Abid,"Kasur , Pakistan - Nine-year-old Faizan Muhammad stepped out of the mosque where his family lives in the small central Pakistani town of Chunian on a warm September evening .
Hours later , he had still not returned home , and his family began to fear the worst .
The next morning , a local driver found his body in a barren field a few kilometres away , the fourth victim of a series of child kidnappings and murders in the area located in northern Punjab state .
Muhammad 's body was not alone , however . Alongside him , police found human remains and skeletons , later identified to belong to the three other boys who were kidnapped , raped and murdered between June and September this year .
After a two-week hunt , during which police took DNA samples from more than 1,700 people in the area , they narrowed down their search to just one suspect : Sohail Shahzad , a local rickshaw driver .
People chant slogans to condemn the rape and killing of seven-year-old girl Zainab Ansari in Kasur , during a protest in Karachi [ File : Akhtar Soomro/Reuters ]
Shahzad confessed to the murders , saying he would take his rickshaw around town in the evening , just as the summer 's scorching temperatures began to drop and children came out of their homes to play .
He would offer the boys 100 rupees ( roughly $ 0.60 ) and a rickshaw ride . Once they hopped on , he would rape and strangle them to death , his confessional statement to police says .
Cases of missing children are not new in Kasur district , where Chunian is located . There has been a spate of recent child kidnappings , rapes and assaults reported in recent years .
Kasur - under the microscope after a child pornography ring was broken up here in 2015 - illustrates how Pakistan 's newly strengthened child protection laws and authorities have failed to stop such crimes .
Last year alone , over 3,800 cases of child sexual abuse were reported across Pakistan , a country of 207 million people , according to child rights organisation , Sahil .
The most vulnerable groups were identified as boys between the ages of six and 15 years old , and girls who are either infants or between 16 and 18 years old .
The numbers are not atypical for the region . In India 's capital New Delhi alone , over 2,000 rape cases were reported in 2018 , while in Bangladesh , a survey conducted last year said 87 percent of children had experienced sexual abuse .
India introduced the death penalty for child rapists last year to try to control the rising number of cases .
In 2017 , Pakistan 's penal code was amended to address the endemic problem of child abuse . Laws were tightened concerning child pornography , exposure of a child to seduction and child sexual abuse . Rights organisations , however , say not enough is being done .
`` Our laws are certainly strong enough for convictions in child abuse cases , '' says Manizeh Bano , Sahil 's executive director . `` The problem remains with implementation . ''
More recently , child-friendly courts have also been set up in parts of the country , where there are particular hours for children so they do not interact with adult criminals or suspects .

''","Kasur, Pakistan - Nine-year-old Faizan Muhammad stepped out of the mosque where his family lives in the small central Pakistani town of Chunian on a warm September evening.

Hours later, he had still not returned home, and his family began to fear the worst.

The next morning, a local driver found his body in a barren field a few kilometres away, the fourth victim of a series of child kidnappings and murders in the area located in northern Punjab state.

Muhammad's body was not alone, however. Alongside him, police found human remains and skeletons, later identified to belong to the three other boys who were kidnapped, raped and murdered between June and September this year.

After a two-week hunt, during which police took DNA samples from more than 1,700 people in the area, they narrowed down their search to just one suspect: Sohail Shahzad, a local rickshaw driver.

Shahzad confessed to the murders, saying he would take his rickshaw around town in the evening, just as the summer's scorching temperatures began to drop and children came out of their homes to play.

He would offer the boys 100 rupees (roughly $0.60) and a rickshaw ride. Once they hopped on, he would rape and strangle them to death, his confessional statement to police says.

Cases of missing children are not new in Kasur district, where Chunian is located. There has been a spate of recent child kidnappings, rapes and assaults reported in recent years.

Kasur - under the microscope after a child pornography ring was broken up here in 2015 - illustrates how Pakistan's newly strengthened child protection laws and authorities have failed to stop such crimes.

New laws, no implementation

Last year alone, over 3,800 cases of child sexual abuse were reported across Pakistan, a country of 207 million people, according to child rights organisation, Sahil.

The most vulnerable groups were identified as boys between the ages of six and 15 years old, and girls who are either infants or between 16 and 18 years old.

The numbers are not atypical for the region. In India's capital New Delhi alone, over 2,000 rape cases were reported in 2018, while in Bangladesh, a survey conducted last year said 87 percent of children had experienced sexual abuse.

India introduced the death penalty for child rapists last year to try to control the rising number of cases.

In 2017, Pakistan's penal code was amended to address the endemic problem of child abuse. Laws were tightened concerning child pornography, exposure of a child to seduction and child sexual abuse. Rights organisations, however, say not enough is being done.

""Our laws are certainly strong enough for convictions in child abuse cases,"" says Manizeh Bano, Sahil's executive director. ""The problem remains with implementation.""

More recently, child-friendly courts have also been set up in parts of the country, where there are particular hours for children so they do not interact with adult criminals or suspects.

There are still, however, no counsellors to take care of a child's psychological needs, or staff trained to speak with victims of trauma, says Bano.

""When children come to court they should have a screen in front of them so they can testify without having to face their accuser,"" says Bano, adding that children should also be allowed to give their account on video if the laws are to be implemented in spirit.

At present, police in Punjab province, where Kasur is located, are working on some of these changes to make the investigation process easier on children, including visiting children at home rather than forcing them to come to police stations to record their statements.

'Hang him'

In a country where there is often little trust in the justice system, there is still anger among the victims' families.

Muhammad's father, a quiet man, speaks loudly only when he is asked what justice means to him.

""When the police have arrested him, then what are they doing? He needs to be hanged publicly, so people remember this can also be done to them,"" he says.

Rights groups have said capital punishment does not deter crime - particularly crimes involving sexual assault - but for the victims' families in Kasur, it seems there is no other acceptable outcome.

Albany Bureau

ALBANY, N.Y. — New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's abrupt resignation announcement Monday sparked a potential free-for-all in the state Legislature, which will ultimately pick his replacement.

Schneiderman, a Democrat who rose to national prominence for his many battles with President Donald Trump, announced he will resign at the close of business Tuesday after The New Yorker detailed allegations from four women who say the attorney general slapped, choked and otherwise degraded them.

Since Schneiderman resigned, New York law says state lawmakers will pick his successor.

How will that work? Here's what you need to know:

What happens now?

The Senate and Assembly, in a joint session, will pick someone to fill out the remainder of Schneiderman's four-year term, which runs through the end of the year.

It's all laid out in Section 41 of the state's Public Officers Law, according to Bennett Liebman, Albany Law School's government lawyer-in-residence.

The law reads, in part: ""When a vacancy occurs or exists, other than by removal, in the office of comptroller or attorney-general ... the two houses thereof, by joint ballot, shall appoint a person to fill such actual or prospective vacancy.""

It will be up to legislative leaders when to call the session.

Who will control the process?

The Democrat-led Assembly and Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx.

There are 213 seats in the state Legislature, meaning Schneiderman's successor will need 107 votes from lawmakers.

There are 104 Assembly Democrats in the chamber, according to Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Heastie. That's by far the single-largest bloc of votes among the legislative conferences and almost a majority on its own.

Has this happened before?

Yes. Several times.

When Comptroller Alan Hevesi resigned amid a corruption scandal in late 2006, it set off a chaotic process to replace him.

Lawmakers — led by Assembly Democrats — ultimately settled on then-Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to succeed Hevesi, a choice that angered then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who preferred several candidates with more financial experience.

DiNapoli, however, was popular among his legislative colleagues, who voted him in. And he's won two terms since then.

In 1993, the Legislature picked another Democratic assemblyman — Oliver Koppell — to replace Robert Abrams as attorney general after Abrams stepped down a year early.

Will there be an election?

Yes.

The state attorney general position is on the ballot every four years. That includes this November, when a full four-year term will be up for grabs.

Manny Alicandro, a Republican corporate attorney from Manhattan, announced his bid for the seat Monday, hours before Schneiderman's resignation.

But Republican leaders say others could soon hop into the race, particularly after Schneiderman's exit.

Democrats, meanwhile, now have an unexpected vacancy to fill on their statewide ticket, but they have an advantage since the Legislature will almost certainly pick a Democrat to temporarily succeed Schneiderman.

But being selected by lawmakers to fill out Schneiderman's term isn't a guarantee that a candidate will win in November.

In 1994, Koppell lost a Democratic primary for attorney general. A Republican — Dennis Vacco — ultimately won in November.

An example of the ex-vice president’s likely support base came at a recent firefighters’ convention where he was greeted by chants of, “Run Joe, run!” Speaking to the Guardian early last week, Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said: “He has the voice – a voice that connects to the working class... and that the current president was able to steal away from the Democratic party.”

Ending a model of abuse

It’s been nearly two months, and a geologic age, since the New York Times ran its initial report on Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s sexual predation.

It’s difficult to think of any piece of journalism that has ever wrought such an instant change in American life. First, more allegations against Weinstein flooded in, and then against other Hollywood, media, and political figures, many of them rapidly defenestrated upon credible allegations of sexual misconduct.

A heightened awareness around sexual harassment is roiling multiple industries in what is a low-grade cultural revolution.

Any revolution has its pitfalls. There will be false allegations that will be believed. There will be a conflation of relatively minor infractions with criminal acts. And, in all likelihood, there will be an over-correction that will create its own wrongs. But a model of predation practiced by scruple-less powerful men is getting destroyed before our eyes, and it’s a very good thing.

The model worked like this: Men with a certain prestige would make gross, aggressive, or even coercive advances on lower-status women, usually young and making their starts in their careers. The men probably considered it a percentage play. Sometimes, their advances might work for their purposes. If not, they assumed that the women would stay silent out of embarrassment or fear. Failing that, the women could be discredited or bought off.

This is what has changed so quickly over the last two months. An accuser no longer has to worry about not getting a hearing or suffering consequences for coming forward. The best journalistic outlets in the country are seeking them out and trying to confirm their stories.

Now, it is the predators — no matter how entrenched and successful — who are in a precarious position. They can fall from grace within hours of credible accounts of wrongdoing. It doesn’t matter how abjectly they apologize or promise to get therapy and engage in self-reflection. They are powerless before their accusers.

To push an issue, a leader usually needs to have integrity or street cred. Abraham Lincoln had the first when he led the country out of slavery. Richard Nixon, a security hawk, had the second when he made peace with China. President Donald Trump admittedly has neither when it comes to women's issues.
